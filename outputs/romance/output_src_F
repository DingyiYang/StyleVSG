[male] took me to shay rouge tonight . it was so fancy . we had pate de meat . it was $ 50 a plate ! i had to snap another picture of it because it was just a shock of how much it actually cost ! we shared a plate and the waiter snubbed his nose at us . next we had raw beef . it gets prepared and cooked for 3.9 seconds in the broiler and then served . wow it 's cold . the dessert after dinner was unusual . it contained fish eggs . for a $ 600 dinner it sure was crap !

gas stations are not intended to be called home , but sometimes it can be seen that way . when you live on the road , it 's almost like you live everywhere . sometimes that feeling is quite overwhelming . however , there are certain rewards to living on the road . each day is a new day filled with new sights and excitement . each sight is unique and reminds us that tomorrow will be just as exciting .

fido is a little nervous since the humans seem to be behaving a little strangely . fido has never seen a group with masks and shields and swords . he is even more nervous as he observes a really tall biped with an ugly face . the hot blond does little to settle fido 's nerves . fido is frozen . he does n't quite feel fear , but he is sure anxious . finally he begins to relax because he sees these humans with regular faces and they are smiling .

4292424265 4292416229 4292424943 4293168784 4293162714
it was a fine day , and the old abbey . the gates were closed , and there was no one in sight . and the halls were empty , it seemed to me that there was no one in sight . and the grass , which had been shut up by a door leading to an open field . and i could not believe that it had been so long ago , the gates were closed .
we approached the property that was to be our vacation home . a nice tall hedge tunnel leads from back yard to garden . also a large hallway on one side of house . an awesome looking view from this window . yet more hallways to venture down and explore .

i love exploring buildings by myself . once you 've taken in the outside you get the chance to explore the interior spaces . and sometimes you are just overwhelmed by how much time it must have taken to build such structures a long time ago . but you understand the drive to build them in such beautiful locations . and how the spaces just call for meditation .

we checked our reserves and unfortunately we were running low on almost everything . the only place to replenish our stores was the [location] , over run with infected hordes . checking our fortification for weaknesses , just part of the exit routine . we took in the desolate landscape as we made our way to our destination . the emptiness of our surroundings gave us a false sense of security and a false allusion of things to come . we made our way to the hardware store under cover of darkness . if anything could go wrong it had n't , yet .

the view of the city from the building top . the sun is setting in the distance overlooking the city . the view away from the sun overlooking the city . on top of the building is the platform where the pictures were took . the sun shadows of the tall buildings in the city picture .

it was a beautiful city , in the distance . and i could see nothing of the city , it seemed to me . i had never seen such a thing like this before , but it was not worth while to think of me . i could not help thinking of the capital , and that it would have been better for me to do so . and i knew that it was only a mile away from the city .
our trip to the city was wonderful . we watched ships passed everyday . the bridge was beautiful . we toured a historic light house . the sunset was lovely our last day here .

925423901 925423977 926271380 926271470 925424227
the next morning , when i had left [location] . and i could see the city below me . i could not see it from the sky . i saw the city , and looked up at it . and i knew that it was the bridge of [location] .
is a great place to get away to . there are some fantastic views there . we even got to watch the sunrise . it was fun to see all the buildings in the city . this bridge was my favorite place to visit , so magnificant .

926271470 925423901 925424227 925425773 926272822
it was a beautiful city , in the distance . and i could see nothing of the city , it seemed to me . i had never seen such a thing like this before , it seemed to me that there was no one on the bridge . i could not see the column of [location] . and i knew that it would be worth while to get away from the city .
the beautiful city of [location] can be seen . the [location] is shown over the [location] . the [location] is red . this big tower stands tall . the people stand above the view with the [location] behind them .

it was a great relief to see the sphinx . and the pyramids of [male] , who had never been seen before . and then we came to a camel , which was of the same kind that i had never seen before . and we had to wait for a long time , until the pyramids of [location] were over . and then , as we were leaving the temple of king [male] .
the [location] gets a bad rap , but going there is amazing . we saw statues that date back centuries and it 's really humbling to look at them . of course modern transportation is still kind of iffy out there , so the old ways work best , namely camels . looking at all this history really made us think . what would our legacy be in 1000 years ? and of course there was the sphinx . trust me , seeing it on tv and movies is nothing compared to seeing it in real life .

nature walks are a good way for children to get exercise and learn about the world around them . rushing , falling water can teach them about gravity , waterflow , inertia and speed . they can even learn from man made structures meant to control water . a calm body of water will let them explore wildlife that inhabit the water and surrounding area . they can even learn about local flora .

there was a wood in the woods , which she had never seen before . and she saw the gate open , which had been cut into a ditch . and there were no flowers in the fields , she had never seen them before . and the old farm house , where she had lived . and she was a poor little girl , who had never seen her in the fields .
in the forest , hidden almost away from view was a large patch of land owned by a local farmer . there was n't any indication that anyone lived on the land , that is unless one discovered an old gate leading to the property . amongst the field there were also beautiful wildflowers that lined the fence and the farmer 's property . once inside , one would come to a large building that seemed abandoned on first glance . however , if one were to venture inside they would find an array of different livestock and animals .

it 's very hard to get an appointment for a spa treatment at the most popular spa in town . even so , the waiting room was quite empty . i tried different chairs as i waited , including this one in the corner by the window . the whole two hours i waited for my appointment , i did n't see another soul . finally , i was called into the hall to go to my treatment room . i was pretty sick of waiting by that point . however , it was all worthwhile . when i saw that raspberry ripple mousse hair treatment , i knew i was in for a gold star experience .

it was a long time before the storm had gone away . and the wind was blowing , it had been a storm . and the storm of wind blew in upon us . the wind blew , and it was blowing a storm of lightning . and the sky was broken with dust , as if it had been a storm .
we went to stay at an old log home last weekend . there were many giant windmills surrounding the home . at night they would spin silently . when it really blew hard the noise they made was deafening . we had beautiful sunsets out there .

today started out as a very nice day on our coast to coast bicycle tour . it started our fairly sunny , but mother nature had other things in store for us . we wanted to accomplish at least 100 miles and breeze through [location] , however when the winds changed , we were stuck . we started out with a tail wind and were averaging 18-20 miles per hour on our bicycles , but that all changed at around 11am . we now had a tail wind and were only making an average speed of 6 miles per hour . it was like riding through quick sand . to make matters worse , the cloud cover kept thickening up and ultimately we were stuck in a bad hail storm so we had to make camp in a field and compete our day with only 50 miles under our belts .

so much beauty can be found when you know where to look . the great open fields filled with rows of windmills took my breath at dusk . with the sun shining through the clouds behind the windmills , i felt i could watch forever . they towered high into the sky . so high they seemed to enjoy the company of the clouds .

656688181 658194078 655912331 656793006 657081239

the family took a trip to the countryside . the sunsets were always beautiful out there . even the windmills look great in such a scenic area . there really were a lot of windmills out there . it made us happy to see all that clean energy .

this house has seen it all weather wise . now it 's such a beautiful sight to see . the windmills were engulfed within the clouds before i took this one . as the sun set it 's like peace and relaxation sitting here . the windmills were as tall as skyscrapers and they generate so much power ! during the car ride home i had to take one last photo . it was a good one .

the two men were riding on their way to [location] . where there was no place to be found , and they were now in the dark . where there had been no one in the cellar , and they were now dead . and there was a narrow passage leading up to the bottom of this tunnel . and the water was so clear that he could see it .
on a lonesome , winding mountain road , while riding our bikes , we were abducted . down tight , filthy corridors we were drug , our terror growing the deeper we were brought . we were left in a stone walled room with only a metal ladder for an exit ; there we were subjected to unrepeatable acts of torture and depravity . months later , what was left of us was taken through a dirt tunnel ... ... and tossed into the putrid pea green lake , which our restless spirits to this day haunt .

living in the mountains of [location] has been one of the best decisions i ever made . here you have access to biking trails and hiking trails with the most awesome views ever . there are a surprising number of lakes and reservoirs where you can sail or motor boat or try any water sport you like . i like rock climbing along the north face . lake powell is my favorite with the [location] as the runner up .

the two men were riding on their way to [location] . where they found themselves in a narrow passage . where there was no one in the cellar , he had found himself . he found himself in a cave . he would have gone to the bottom of a dam .
it 's a long hike to the hidden lagoon . the housing is very basic , in underground dugouts . we sleep in the cool , long tunnels . they all have drains to the outside . but it 's all worth it when we get to bathe in the green-blue warm water .

my photo-taking journey around the city started with this lovely scaffolding under a deep blue sky . this lovely gentleman on this tri-ped breezed past me . the beautiful trashcan gave me inspriation as contrasta gainst the grey street stripes . the stained glass i saw later on reminded me of old englande . and near the end , this chimney swept my heart away in atmospheric ruminations .

a bright blue sky to start off the day . taking the trike on a drive across town . passed an odd shaped trash can that could have seen better days . saw a beautiful glass sign that was perfect for the old lady but the owner refused to sell . above a crow watches from the chimney .

[male] usually drives his car to [female] 's but today he only had enough gas in his car to get back and forth to work until payday , so he road his dirt bike through the streets to get to her .

we woke up to find our entire neighborhood covered in snow . i never look forward to cleaning the snow off of the car . most of the roads were closed , so i decided that it would be more fun to spend the day enjoying the snow with the kids rather than clean the snow off of the car . the kids had so much fun building a snowman that my five year old ended up with snow in her hood . big sister is helping to clear the snow out . by the look on her face , i think she might have put it there in the first place ! by evening the roads were fairly clear . that means it 's back to work tomorrow .

the party was a great one , and there were many people in it . and there was a bottle of beer in my hand . it was the night of a party . i had no time to drink a glass of beer . and i was not sure what to say , but that the game would be too much for me .
everyone is enjoying the party . everyone has a drink in their hand ! there were a lot of people who showed up to the party . everyone comes to get a drink . there were plenty of drinks for everyone .

it was a curious thing to say , that he had not been in the habit of looking at them . he was a little tired , and his eyes were fixed on him . and the elephants , as if he had been a lion . and he would not be able to get away from me , so i took him into the enclosure . and then he sat down on the sofa , staring at me .
i love animals and i like coming to the zoo to see my favorite ones . i love the monkeys because they 're cute and do funny things . i love the elephants because they breath through their trunk , which i think is pretty strange . i love the zebras because they look a lot like a striped horse . but the animals i love most are my two best friends that are waiting for me to come home .

it was a strange thing to see , and she had never seen anything like this before . he was a little frightened at the sight of her . and then , when he saw her in the distance . he said , `` i do not know what you are doing with him . '' said he , looking at the animal like a tiger .
the family took a train ride to the zoo today . the little boy was excited once he got to the zoo . they went on the sky lift to see the animals below . they saw all kinds off elephants below . they loved seeing the zebras .

it was a strange thing to see , and she had never seen anything like this before . he was a little frightened at the sight of her . and then , as if he had been in the habit of taking her away from him . but he was not afraid of the animal , and his eyes were so big that it seemed to him like a tiger . he would not have been able to get away from the animals , but when they saw him .
the family went our month trip to the zoo . the little ones are always the most excited . the view from the chair ride is always really cool . the whole family loves seeing the elephants . my favorite animal has always been the zebra ,

it was a curious thing to say , that he had not been in the habit of looking at them . he looked at me , and saw that it was his habit to see him . and the elephants , as if he had been a monkey . and i saw that he was a tiger . and then he went to bed , i found him lying on the sofa .
today we visited the zoo . it was our first time seeing an animal like this one . the elephants were fun to watch . the zebras were not very active . when we arrived home the dogs were waiting patiently for us .

6669424705 6669434503 6669440391 6669441297 6629461767
it was a curious thing to say , that he had not been in the habit of looking at them . he was a little tired , but i could not help thinking of him . and he would not have been able to keep me in the enclosure . and then i saw that the animal was dead , but he did not care to see me . and then he sat down on the sofa , staring at me .
took my kid out to the zoo . he was mesmerized by all the animals there . this little guy was adorable ! he kept coming to the window at us . elephants are such amazing creatures . they 're so intelligent . they even had zebras there ! i 've never seen one this close before . and we ended the day relaxing with our very own animals at home .

[female] and i had been together for a long time . and i told her that she was a witch . and i asked her if she did not know what to do with me . and then we all sat down in a corner of the fire . and then she told me that i had no fire .
i visited my sister and her husband this weekend . she does n't like having her picture taken . we helped set up the christmas tree . after the christmas tree was set up we went out for dinner . after dinner we went back to their place where she showed us her flaming hula hoop trick .

it was the night of [female] 's party . and there was a party in the midst of all that night . and [male] , who had come to the christmas tree . and then they lit the lantern , but he did not know what to say . and he said , `` i do not know why you are going to dance with me . ''
meeting new people at parties is something we all love to do . people gathered in the kitchen getting drinks and chatting . my mate standing next to the christmas tree lit up with lights . torches in a row leading to the backyard . fire dancers lit their hoops and put on quite a show .

8350332648 8349268393 8349267615 8350328680 8349262525
it was the night of [female] 's party . and there was a party in the midst of all that night . and [male] , who had been waiting for the night to be lit up in a great christmas tree . and the torches were lit up , but he did not know what to do with them . and he was not a man , but his legs were burning in the fire .
its new years eve and a group of friends are having a party . they are mixing all kinds of drinks in the kitchen . a gentleman poses by the christmas tree for a photo . the group then moves to the backyard where the owners of the home have prepared a special treat . there is a performance by a fire dancer right before midnight for everyone to enjoy .

8350332648 8349268393 8349267615 8350328680 8349262525
it was the night of [female] 's party . and there was a party in the midst of all that night . and [male] , who had come to the christmas tree . and the torches were lit up , but he did not wish to see them . and then , as if he had been a dragon in the fire .
[male] and [female] 's christmas party was going swell so far . lots of punk friends and whatnot , it was pretty unorthodox compared to a traditional christmas party . [male] 's brother clearly is n't very good at taking pictures . instead of just hanging around the tree we went outside for a surprise ... . fire swinging performance . it was pretty exciting .

8349259523 8350328154 8350329404 8350327656 8349263551
[female] and i had been together for a long time . and i told her that she was not the only one who had ever seen me . and then , as i had said to my sister in law . and we had a great deal to drink , but i did not know what was going on . and that i had no wish to save her from the burning flame of fire .
our first christmas in [location] felt strange . i was n't used to the summer christmas weather . my wife gemma worked hard to make it a special day . she had a surprise for me . she had put up a big christmas tree , a type that did n't grow naturally here ! she also invited over a lot of my [location] friends to make me feel more at home . i did n't even mind the part of the party that took place outside in the heat !

`` i do not know what you are doing , '' she said . said [male] , with a sigh of relief . and then , as if he had been in a state of light . she said , `` do not you want me ? '' he said . said he , `` i am going to have a piece of art for you . ''
the photographer of the series thought quite abstractly . she did portraits , but only in black in white . many of her photographs were simply patterns and she rarely offered explanations of why she chose to put these on display . the people she photographed seemed to have vibrant personalities that brought light to the pictures . the rare color photograph she took was still quite unusual .

7002675114 7148761587 7002675998 7148771071 7002682260
there was no light in the room , but it seemed to me that i had not yet seen anything like this . i could not believe that it was the only light of a room in which there were no stars . i had no idea what it was , but the walls were empty . and the broken glass , which had been used for a long time . it was not the only place i had ever seen .
a deep square room , the has all the mystery that one could think of . as we start to walk down the pathway from that room we come upon this odd looking room as well . we turn left and find another mystical room with a door to go to another . as we walk through we come to the open area of an art museum . we end our mystical trip back outside of the hall of wonders .

there was no light in the room , but it seemed to me that i had not yet seen anything like this . it was the only light i had ever seen . i could see nothing but the corridor . i could not believe that it was a broken glass . but i was not sure what it would be , the building had been built up for me .
i had a dream i was going down a long tunnel with a light at the end . above were lights . or were they stars ? i finally found myself in a bright room . when things came into focus , i saw strange alien sculptures . i ran away from that building as fast as i could !

`` i do not know what you are doing , '' she said . said [male] , with a sigh of relief . and then , as if he had been in a state of light . she said , `` do not you want me ? '' she said . i am not sure what this is , but it 's a piece of art .
[female] was embarking on a day of accumulating some more of her photographic art . her first subject was a portrait of a man in a hat . the backgrounds is stark adding to the artistic expression of the photo . next , [female] took a photo of still art . she appreciated the pattern seemingly extending forever . back to a live subject , she selected a female with a sense of motion in the photo . the last item was another still art with a pattern that fascinated [female] . she was comfortable with the mix of portraits and still art she created .

[female] started working on her new trailer for the big video premiere . she had lots of great footage of the main character , rob . she mixed that footage with some artsy scenes of the room that most of the story took place . [female] , the other main girl , also made an appearance . when the trailer was done , [female] printed some stills of the frames and took them to the local art gallery .

me and a few coworkers decided to go out for happy hour . my assistant was thrilled because she was tired from working so much and needed some relaxation . to my fellow coworkers could n't wait to sit at the bar and have drinks . my two bosses were really enjoying themselves . it started getting late and we realized we did n't even have dinner yet .

4257686 4257842 3479460 4258527 4258823
`` i am so glad to see you , '' said [female] . said [female] , as she sat down at the tea table . and looked up at the river , as if she had not seen it before . and then , as the sun went down on [female] 's shoulder . and the moon shone brightly over her face , as she looked up at it .
while eating lunch and waiting was in conversation with a friend of mine . a storm started to roll in as we were finishing our meal . a shot of the skyline as it started to cloud over . the ships started to pull in as the sun started to set . a ferris wheel stretching up towards the sky so tall .

4257842 4257686 4257763 4257909 4258527
it was a fine day , and there were many people at the bar . and [female] , who had never been able to make any acquaintance with me . i had never seen her before , but they were both of them . and the two men who had met in [location] were both of them . and i had a great view of the river .
the party we went to was a lot of fun . it was rainy outside but we were very dry inside . i met a lot of new and interesting people there . afterward we got together to exchange contact information . once night started to fall people started leaving .

a nice business meeting was set up on a cold october day . [female] an intern for one of the leading companies was having a drink with a few associates to hand in some paperwork . during her dinner a few old friends approached her and asked if they could join . the two associates loved making new friends and welcomed the females . they had a nice dinner and ended the night with a boat ride .

4257686 4257842 3479460 4258527 4258823
`` i am so glad to see you , '' said [female] . said [female] , as she sat down at the tea table . and looked up at the river , she saw that it was dark . and then , as we sat down on the river bank . and , as the sun went down on [female] 's head .
me and my lover went on a vacation to see some sights . here we are getting something to eat . we liked the food but the place was rather crowded for our tastes . here is a view of the city from our hotel . it was so lovely to look out every night as the sun went down . another shot from high up . it was breath taking to watch the city light up as the sun went down . we where in line for a ferris wheel . i thought that this would make a good pic , and i think it came out well .

it was a new structure of art . and the iron bars of steel , which seemed to be like a pyramid . and a pyramid of gold , which had been built for the first time in years . and the two towers , of which they had never been able to be seen . the ceiling was of a pyramid , and it seemed as if they had been built .
we had been working hard all week to finish building our space ball . we had to wait forever to get all of the panels assembled . we had to climb all over the structure . it was really difficult to fasten them all in place . after a long time we finally finished it .

11590525183 11590516603 11591103646 11590760395 11590291765
it was necessary to make a piece of art . and i learned that it would be hard to use them . and that i would not be able to put it into the earth . if i had not been able to get it out of the question . and i could not help thinking of it , but the whole thing was done .
[male] started to make aluminum sculptures . once he started he could not stop , he mad huge creations . he made a triforce but took it a step further . now it 's a giant aluminum ball ! to this day it stands in central park !

11590525183 11590516603 11591103646 11590760395 11590291765
it was necessary to make a piece of art . and i learned that it would be hard to use them . and that i had never been able to put it into the earth . and i could not help thinking that it was a great thing to do . and i would not be able to keep it in the shape of a pyramid .
here we viewed the making of a giant glass decorative ball . each small triangle piece was carefully put into place . the individual triangles made larger triangles which would then be put together as a large ball-like ornament . it was high anxiety waiting for that last piece to be put into place . the final outcome was amazing ; so decorative and elegant looking .

11590525183 11590516603 11591103646 11590760395 11590291765
it was necessary to make a piece of art . and i learned that it would be hard to use them . and that i would not be able to put it into the earth . if i had not been able to get it out of the question . and i could not help thinking that it was a new piece of work .
creating a geodesic dome out of glass is a painstaking process . the tiny triangles all have to be fitted together precisely . these , then , form larger triangles . which are then fitted together to make the dome . in the end , all that 's left is to take a picture of this unique structure .

11590523983 11591111666 11590760395 11590625934 11590622884
it was a new structure of art . and the iron bars of steel , which seemed to be like a pyramid . and a pyramid of gold , which had been built for years . and the two towers , of which they had never been able to be seen . the ceiling was of a pyramid , and it seemed as if they had been built .
there is a mission to build something unique . a piece of art that really stands out . although it has taken time and piece by piece it seems to get harder , it still gets done . the men hold together a triangle base for each piece . careful to not drop the art , the men focus hard on the outcome . in conclusion the art piece stands tall and beautiful , proving that hard work goes a long way .

it was the first time i had ever seen her before . i had never been able to get a good deal of wine in the shop . and then i went into the dining room with my wife . and the salad was so delicious , that i could not eat it . and then she put it on a piece of bread .
as i was waiting for my brother to have dinner with me i had me a cappuccino and was reading my favorite book . i kept waiting at the bar for my brother he took a long time . my brother finally came and we got seated . for dinner i ordered some kind of meatball soup . my brother decided just to have some kind of egg cold beef sandwich .

12844386723 12844384423 12844305455 12844380223 12844709524
it was a good thing for me to eat . it was the only place i had ever seen . and i was not sure what to do , but it seemed as if they had been waiting for me . i had a great deal of business to do with it . i had never been able to eat it before , but the food was so good .
we had all gone out for lunch yesterday . after we finished eating we decided to walk around for a little bit . there were a lot of interesting shops that we passed by . afterward we decided to grab some dinner at another restaurant . they had some strange food there .

12843468144 12843042835 12844395593 12844723404 12844706914
it was the first time i had ever seen her before . i had never been able to make a new acquaintance with her , but the place was too small for me . i had been in the habit of going to dinner with her . she had a great deal of delicious food . and i was not sure what it meant , but that she had a great deal of bread .
trying a new restaurant is always scary , but i was determined to write a review for my blog , so i sat down at a table with a magazine and ordered a cappuccino . the bar was fully stocked and had several beers on tap . the ambiance was understated , and created an air of intimacy in the small space . the menu was expansive , some of the foods , like this dish drawing upon asian influences . other dishes had a decidedly mediterranean flair .

dining out in a foreign country is always an experience . they put salt in our hot chocolate , and when we asked why , they handed us a book about salt . the pubs have a million different beers , and they are all warm . sometimes the dining areas have an interesting ambience ... like this place where we ate in a hallway . this soup i tried was pretty good though i 'm not sure what was in it . but , i was n't a fan of hard-boiled eggs on my sandwich .

12843468144 12843042835 12844395593 12844723404 12844706914
it was the first time i had ever seen her before . i had never been able to make a new acquaintance with her , but it was not the only place in which she lived . i had a great deal to say about it . and i could not help thinking that it would be better for me to eat . it was only a little more than i had expected from her , but she did not know what to say .
today , our friends gathered together for some food after work . we arrived somewhat early , so things were n't too packed yet . however , that quickly changed , and things became quite busy ! the food provided was amazingly delicious . subs and other sandwiches were also available on the menu .

taking a tour of famous buildings in the city . i remembered this one from a tv show . the dome on this one was marvelous . we could n't stop to go in any more since it was night , but we got to see the empire state building from a distance , and the courthouse all lit up with the [location] flag . unfortunately , the last stop on our tour took us past this ugly paragon of advertisement .

my friend decided to show off his new warehouse office to me one day . the office was an open plan , but had a kitchen worked in to the former warehouse space . his future office had the brick wall of the building as a feature wall . the ceiling had interesting light fixtures installed . the floor plan showed where his office was in relation to all the others .

today was the move in day for the college student who was moving into his first apartment alone . he was very excited about planning out where he was going to move all his furniture . this wall will be sturdy enough to hang his new television . the lighting is unique and will help save money versus using his old lamps . he also made sure to take note of the fire escape plan for the future . he was prepared for anything and excited to finally move in .

in this way , i had no idea what was going on . it was a long time before the clock struck twelve . the windows were closed , and there was no one in it . and i was not sure what it would be , but there were none of them . but i had never been in the kitchen before , it was my own business to do so .
the house i bought required a lot of renovations . i ordered the original house plans to help me decide what to do . i started with the wooden trim in the living room . then i did a many-paned window in the bedroom . the cellar used to have very cool wooden columns on bricks , and i restored them . i painted the kitchen the shade of pewter blue it was years ago . i love the way the house is working out !

there was a great deal of work in the machinery . and the machinery , which had been used for many years . and the old machinery had been torn up , it was not a thing to do with . it was the only thing that had ever been used to do for a long time . the old man 's car had been broken down , and now it was all over again .
the truck was orange and rusted . the tires were in a close jumble . the bus was broken down and rusted . the bus was well prepared and old . inside , i could see the interior .

4379270527 4379271193 4380028382 4380028572 4380031072

decided to explore at an abandoned junkyard today . lots of wrecked cars and vans and trucks , everywhere . not to mention the hundreds of tires . think this is just some broken down junk ? nope . apparently , someone lives here . the warehouse was oddly beautiful . we 'll explore it more deeply the next time we come out .

there was a great deal of work in the machinery . and the machinery , which had been used for many years . and the old machinery had been torn up , it was a great deal of work . but it was not worth while to think of the old machinery which had been used for many years . it was the only thing i had ever seen in my life .
i had never actually been to a junk yard before . look at all of these tires ! somehow i just felt this could make a really great picture for a wall , maybe the office . this bus had definitely seen it 's better days . notice anything different about it ?

4379270527 4379271193 4380028382 4380028572 4380031072

it was the first time she had ever been able to get a ball . but she was not able to throw herself into the ball . and she was going to fight for him . and he was not going to win the ball , but she had no idea of winning him . but he was too good for the game to be over , and they were both in a state of excitement .
our basketball team has been a lot better since we added a good center . her sister still plays for another team , so it was hard to get her to leave . having a center opens up three point shots for our best shooters . it also helps attract other good players like our new point guard . i think our team will only get better as the year goes on .

there was a great deal of confusion in the crowd . but they did not know what to say , there was no sign of protest . but they had no right to do so , it was not the same thing . but they were not the cause of it . and the people who had been waiting for them , they did not know what to say .

there was a great deal of confusion in the crowd . and that they had no right to do so , it was not a matter of fact . and i could not help saying that there was no law in the matter . it was a terrible thing to say , but i do not know what they were saying . but i did not know why they were in the street .
many people came out to support the cause today . we were one of many couples and that impressed us very much since this is so near to our hearts . many of the signs people made had compelling slogans . some people flew flags while others carried the signs . we were moved to another [location] eventually by the authorities .

we had really thought that anti-war rallies were a think of the past . but [female] and stan wanted us to go and see that they are still going on today . sure enough , there were anti-war signs , chants , it had a real 60s feel to it . people seem to be fed up with the whole drone `` robitic killing machine '' thing . but like everything else , all things end . and an hour after the protests , you could n't even tell anything had happened there .

here we go with another one of those school function activities where the kids dress up and meet at school to get their awards during which snack food is served . some of the students prefer to get away from the crowd to enjoy their food and it looks like they found a good place . my friend 's little brother seems to have found a fancy meeting room to spend his time in and he pulled out the first aid kit just in case it is needed . now that i am finished , i will be glad to be getting back home because i really do n't like crowds and these occasions . my friend wanted to take a picture of my braces to show my mom that i did not have candy stuck between my teeth .

it was a great day for the girls to go out together . there was a stream of water in the valley . and there was no one else to see them , but they were not the prettiest of all . they had never seen such beautiful flowers , but were not the prettiest of all . and the fish , as if they had not been caught in their hearts .
us and our close friends at a botanical garden . there was a beautiful waterfall that we could see up close . next we saw the flowers , this pink one was an all around favorite . this rose was also a close second favorite . lastly we watched the fish in the koi pond .

my class went on a trip to local park . there , they had some small waterfalls . the flower we saw were exquisite . there were so many different color buds . we ended the day by a pond filled with goldfish .

she looked at him , and saw that he was looking for something in the garden . and they looked at each other in the water , there was a scent of blue . and then they came to a stream of fish . and the moss that had grown up in their beds , they seemed to grow like a snake . and the water flowed down a little higher , then they came to an old brook .
i love to go on nature walks . there are beautiful lily pads in the pond behind my house . there are also colorful coi fish . the warm sun shines down on a fallen tree . the little waterfall reminds me how breath taking nature is .

[female] and i had a great time at the zoo . and i saw that there was no one in the temple who had come to see me . and there was a temple in the middle of which i had never seen before . and the temple of [male] , who had been waiting for me . and i was so glad to see him , that he had taken me into the cellar .
the first thing we did when we got off the train in [location] , [location] was to feed the deer in the park . they are used to humans so you can find plenty of them near the entrances to the temples as well . it is hard to really show the scope of how large this particular temple was , but this is the exterior . i really loved seeing this giant buddha which had a very peaceful presence . inside the temple you could attempt to put yourself through this support post are said to be blessed with enlightenment in the next life .

[female] and i had a great time at the zoo . and i saw that they had not been there long enough for me to enter the temple . the temple was full of people who had come to see me . i had never seen anything like that of the monks . and i was so glad to find myself in a dungeon .
we met this deer while we were touring . we followed him along for a while . he actually took us to some cool places . we went inside to look at things . the deer actually stayed there like he was waiting for us !

a deer follows a man on the sidewalk . the man pets the deers mother . the deer gets close to the camera and the man snaps a picture . the man then goes to an [location] temple of some kind . he then relaxes on a mini island .

[female] and i had a great time at the zoo . and i saw that they had not been there long enough for me to enter the temple . and there was no one else in the temple , but i did not wish to see it . i had never seen anything like that of the monks . and i was so glad to see him , that he had been waiting for me at the door .
we visited [location] and got to see animals along the way . there was even a deer that looked comfortable with people . the architecture is very beautiful . the [organization] statue presents a holy aura . lastly , we had fun where it was needed .

it was a fine summer day , and there were no trees on either side . there was no place in the forest , but it had not been for a long time . and there was a little hole in the woods , which had been dug out of it . and the water was so dry that it seemed to be like a river . and it was only a little way to the bottom of this cave .
we crossed the bridge in the park heading for the stream . as we got closer , we could hear the water getting louder . natural rock formation provided glimpses of the area around the stream . when we got to the source of the sound , we found a waterfall . the waterfall and pool created a sort of grotto in the back wall of the rock .

it was a beautiful summer day , and there were no trees in the forest . and there was a little hole in the woods , which had been dug out of it . and where the water had been , there was no cave in it . it was not the only way in which they had been to live , but there were no trees . but it was only a mile away , and i had never seen anything like this before .
since the weather was so nice , we decided to go hiking on some local trails . the kids had a lot of fun playing in and around the natural rock formations . near a flowing stream , we saw a beautiful tree with white blossoms . we came to a foot bridge that crossed over the stream , and lead to the trail up the mountain side . the hike up the mountain was tough , but the views were well worth it .

it was a fine summer day , and there were no trees on either side . there was no place in the forest , but it seemed to him as if he had never seen anything like this before . it was the only way in which he could find himself . and that he would not be able to get out of the water again , it was only a few days later . and then he found himself alone in the cave .
we started our hike at the beautiful old bridge . next we saw the lovely tiny creek . from there we saw many different things along the way including this hole in the tree . this was far and away our favorite part of the hike . it 's beauty was only surpassed by its wonder .

it was a fine summer day , and there were no trees on either side . there was no place in the forest , but it had not been for a long time . and there was nothing to be seen in the woods , but a little way from which it had been hidden . and the water was so deep that it seemed to me as if i had been in a valley . i had never seen anything like it before .
someone is in the bushes . he climbs up the bumpy hill . he looks down upon the stream . he comes across a beautiful waterfall . he then finds a secret passageway under the waterfall .

the rickety old bridge had been there for as long as anyone could remember . along the trail , there were steep caverns . unusual rock formations were abundant . you could see a waterfall in the distance . the river seemed to disappear in the mountain .

`` i do not know what to say , '' said [male] . said he , `` i am going to lunch with you . '' said [male] , as if he had been in the habit of going to [location] . he said to himself , `` what do you want ? '' he said . he said , `` you are going to be a good man . ''
he had never been to such a majestic place before . the locals told him all about the beauty of the land . information was written in stone to tell him about it . the mountains were beautiful . he stood atop them and looked at the vast canyon .

it was the first time he had ever seen her before . and then , as if he had never been able to do any harm in the course of his life . and then he would go to the top of a hill . and he would not be able to climb up the hill , but that was enough for him . and he knew that it would be worth while to get out of the valley .
we went to the park and a deer followed us . we pet it and took pictures with it . then we traveled to the marvelous hotel . the grounds were so immaculate . we also got great pictures of the outside decor .

i went to a restaurant with a friend of mine yesterday . we had n't seen each other in a long time . afterward we decided to go on a hike through the wilderness . there was nobody else out there . we had a great view at the end of the hike .

it was the first time he had ever seen her before . and then , as if he had never been able to do so ; but it was only a mile away from him . he would have gone to the top of a mountain . and he would not be able to get out of the way , but that was all . and then he would go back to the hills again , but there was no one in sight .
the mountains loomed in the distance as i started my hike through the sparsely vegetated desert . the only paths were dirt roads marked by the rangers who travelled them regularly through the wilderness . as i climbed higher and higher there was more greenery and the view was spectacular . i even tried my hand at rock climbing the towering stacks of boulders that were deposited everywhere . once i climbed to the top the view took my breath away ; i could see everywhere i had just hiked in one glance .

it was a perfect day to spend outdoors . a hike seemed like a good idea . spring was the best time to hike in the mountains . rock climbing was also good that day . the views were magnificent .

it was the face of [male] . he was a statue of an ancient man . it is called a grotto , and there was no one in sight . the fog had not been so thick that it seemed to him like a ghost . it was a fog , and he could not bear to see the mist .
the god of fog and mist was angry . he stood ever vigilant over his lands . however the rivers and lakes were polluted . man had caused this , and man would be punished in never-ending fog . the mists and fogs rolled in , the god knew this would be mankind 's final days .

it was a foggy day , and the mist of fog . and the smoke of a forest , which had been scattered over it . and the water was wet with mud , but it seemed to me as if i had been in a bath . and then , as if it had been a mist of fog . and i saw a statue of [male] .
going on a hiking trip in this area will be a blast . what is all that smoke from ? the water is so hot it is boiling the mud . we found this old bridge to cross the treacherous . and at the other side of the bridge we see these great statues !

the jungle was misty and spooky the day we visited the national park . you could see the remains of trees that had burned in a fire that swept over the land a few years ago . the tar pits were constantly bubbling , emitting gas and steam . the bridge crossing the pits was covered with a fine ash from the residue . there were giant tiki statues everywhere paying homage to the native populations that settled the land .

today i experienced the art of another culture . giant statues were created almost a century ago in [location] . there were hidden lakes that made for good vacation spots . an eerie bridge scared me because of the fog . i ended up walking down the bridge and going home .

walking through the hazy jungle . `` what is that ? '' sploosh ! `` be careful numnuts ! '' `` aieeee pull me out [male] ! '' `` where is this place ? '' `` sorry [male] turns out the native new zealanders figured out the true gods . hell is thataway '' .

was it foggy outside or was it smoke from the inside ? being an old hippie sometimes had its disadvantages . seeing the world through a haze and fringe was n't everything she had thought it might be . they lived on the road . her home was the highway and she longed for stability .

[female] looked up at the sky . it looked like rain was coming . she hated driving in the rain . [female] saw many big trucks going the opposite way . it must be a big day for deliveries she thought , as she continued her journey . [female] thought to herself , thank you lord , the skies have cleared up . it did n't look like rain anymore , but she still had four more hours of driving before she 'd reach her parents house in [location] .

it was a long , steep climb of rock . and the red berries that had grown up on them , were of a kind . like a snake , and it seemed as if they were dead . and the little green flowers , which i had never seen before . and i was glad to see them again , but they were not the prettiest of all .
we went on a nature hike today . there were many beautiful things around the forest . we even got to see some wildlife . we took many pictures of all the plants . we had a great time and got so many great pictures .

the windows were open , and there was no one in it . i had no idea what this house was , but it did not seem to me . i could not help thinking of it , there was something in the street . it was a little chilly , but i did not want to leave the shop . i could see the houses , and that they had been so near to me .
the windows on this restaurant have this cool embellishment . the back has a cool retro feel to it . they light up the trees all around the building . the white dog was just hanging around and enjoying the day . you could see a house through the brush .

the windows were open , and there was no one in it . i had no idea what this was , but it seemed to me as if some one were hanging over the wall . i could not help thinking of it , but that was the only thing in my life . it was a little too hot for me to go into the shop . but i was not sure what to do , and it seemed as if there were no houses in the neighbourhood .
i left the house i just got to go see the community . stopped by the neighbors but no one was home . they had lights set for christmas in their trees . the street itself was simple and relaxing . we walked back home through the trail and called it a day .

1382134303 1383032696 1383035734 1382141127 1383040336
the windows were open , and there was no one in it . i had no idea what this was , but it seemed to me as if some one were hanging over the wall . i could not help thinking of it , but that was the way in which my eyes were fixed . i had been waiting for a long time to get out of the shop . i could see the house , and it was only a few yards away .
[male] wanted to fix up his old house . he wanted to redo the bricks on the outside . he got inspiration to also add lights from his neighbor . he walked down to the local hardware store to buy his supplies . he also remembered he needed to mow his front lawn .

it is officially the fall season because i can see that some trees have already turned their leaves to that beautiful color while others will soon follow . i am inside and look out at all the beauty of the fall and i wish it could be like this year round . long walks in the cool autumn air down country roads makes me go back in time to when i used to hunt and fish . i always loved going out in the country in the fall and to me it was the perfect time for everything including football . this pictures sums it all up for me when i say that fall is the most beautiful season and the one that i ca n't wait for every year .

i had never seen any of these beautiful flowers , but they were very pretty . but i do not know what it is , they are the most beautiful trees . i am not sure what this is , but it 's a very pretty garden . it is a large meadow , and the fields are covered with grass . but the grass is green , and there are no hedges on either side .
the pink flowers really stood out that day . i took the longest trail to the garden . the garden led me to a clearing in the forest . many people were already at the spot . i noticed the harvesting lines when i walked around .

2054951184 2054951450 2054952292 2054952870 2054172371

i 've always had a fondness for two things : food and flowers . flowers are diverse and beautiful in each of their own ways , like people . i know more people named after this flower than i do named [male] , [female] or deaken . some flowers define a person 's attire . whoever likes this flower must be a fan of plaid . some represent size , i wish i was as tall as a tree .

it was the first time they had ever been in [location] . but they had not been long in the woods , and that was to be done . and that they would not be able to bear it , but for the first time . and they must have been made of stone , but there was nothing to be done . and they would have been glad to see each other again , it was a great adventure .

there was a full moon that night . the forest was perfectly spooky looking . they found an old path . if they saw sticks tied together like the [male] witch movie , she intended to run . she was relieved when they got to the castle safe and sound .

a full moon brings a melancholy mood the forest below . no sun the next morn to cheer the gray and dreary forest . one full of forgotten and hidden paths . the ground littered with dead wood and rotting leaves . a most formidable defense before the castle at its heart .

one night , a full moon out hung in the sky glowing with a red sheen . i could n't sleep , and headed outside for some fresh air . wind whistled through the leafless trees , making an eerie sound . a shiver ran down my spine . i heard someone coming down the path , making heavy footfalls . it sounded someone was heading straight for me , and fast . panicking , i ducked behind a hill and threw some leaves over myself . i tried to stay perfectly still and quiet until the person passed by . when i was sure all was safe , i made my way carefully back to the castle . i had to get inside and tell someone what had just happened .
