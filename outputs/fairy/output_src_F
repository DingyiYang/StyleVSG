the fire burned in an angry and nasty biblical way . the flames seemed to reached toward heaven . the sky was gray , dark with clouds gathered from the smoke of the fire . the fire as it appears to be loosing its power . fire , still destructive and cruel , but appearing contained .

there was once a king who lived in an old castle . and in the midst of it stood a large castle . it was built of stone , and a castle . and there was no one in it , but the walls were of stone . and the walls of it were so long that no one could see them .

i love exploring buildings by myself . once you 've taken in the outside you get the chance to explore the interior spaces . and sometimes you are just overwhelmed by how much time it must have taken to build such structures a long time ago . but you understand the drive to build them in such beautiful locations . and how the spaces just call for meditation .

we checked our reserves and unfortunately we were running low on almost everything . the only place to replenish our stores was the [location] , over run with infected hordes . checking our fortification for weaknesses , just part of the exit routine . we took in the desolate landscape as we made our way to our destination . the emptiness of our surroundings gave us a false sense of security and a false allusion of things to come . we made our way to the hardware store under cover of darkness . if anything could go wrong it had n't , yet .

the sun was shining brightly , and it seemed to him as if a church had been built . and there was no sign in it , for he did not know where to go . and there were so many things in the town that no one knew where to go . and all the things that were in store for them . and the next morning , when he came to a little town .
our little town has a lot to offer . it 's rural but it 's beautiful . an old rustic park bench shows the serenity of the area . the blue sky show our town to be under clear weather today ! our small businesses give our town some of its rustic charm . the little cafe on the corner is always eager to meet and greet .

the sun casts no shadow on the church . the benches were made of the finest wood . the street signs were cheap because they bend easily . fortunately , the business is successful at this time of year . there was not much going on in the city however .

the snow hit heavy this year . snow covering most of the trees and ground . the snow dramatically bending a tree from its natural form . the skies are clear and warming up . snow is melting away , coming back next year hopefully .

there was once a king who had three sons , the son of [male] . and they were the most beautiful of all , there was once a king who had three sons . they were all dressed in white , and mounted on a camel . so that they could not climb up to the top of it . and the pyramids were so high that it was impossible to see them .
the [location] gets a bad rap , but going there is amazing . we saw statues that date back centuries and it 's really humbling to look at them . of course modern transportation is still kind of iffy out there , so the old ways work best , namely camels . looking at all this history really made us think . what would our legacy be in 1000 years ? and of course there was the sphinx . trust me , seeing it on tv and movies is nothing compared to seeing it in real life .

we took the at risk youth out to a field trip closer to nature . we took them to see waterfalls . these two brothers are part of the program and play a bit too rough for our tastes . we took their attention away from their violent play and towards vegetation . we do n't think the trip was a success .

nature walks are a good way for children to get exercise and learn about the world around them . rushing , falling water can teach them about gravity , waterflow , inertia and speed . they can even learn from man made structures meant to control water . a calm body of water will let them explore wildlife that inhabit the water and surrounding area . they can even learn about local flora .

in the forest , hidden almost away from view was a large patch of land owned by a local farmer . there was n't any indication that anyone lived on the land , that is unless one discovered an old gate leading to the property . amongst the field there were also beautiful wildflowers that lined the fence and the farmer 's property . once inside , one would come to a large building that seemed abandoned on first glance . however , if one were to venture inside they would find an array of different livestock and animals .

on a lonesome , winding mountain road , while riding our bikes , we were abducted . down tight , filthy corridors we were drug , our terror growing the deeper we were brought . we were left in a stone walled room with only a metal ladder for an exit ; there we were subjected to unrepeatable acts of torture and depravity . months later , what was left of us was taken through a dirt tunnel ... ... and tossed into the putrid pea green lake , which our restless spirits to this day haunt .

the roof was made of glass , and they were so high that it could not be seen . and the roof of it was covered with diamonds . it was built of iron . and the top was so big that you could not see it . and the ceiling was like a roof of glass .
we had been working hard all week to finish building our space ball . we had to wait forever to get all of the panels assembled . we had to climb all over the structure . it was really difficult to fasten them all in place . after a long time we finally finished it .

it was a difficult task to get out of the way . so that it was impossible for me to make a piece of wood . and put it into my pocket , i was just going to get out of the way . and put them on the top of it . and then i saw that the glass was made of iron .
[male] started to make aluminum sculptures . once he started he could not stop , he mad huge creations . he made a triforce but took it a step further . now it 's a giant aluminum ball ! to this day it stands in central park !

it was a difficult task to get out of the way . so that it was impossible for me to make a piece of wood . and put it on the top of a piece . and it was so high that you could not get out of the way . and the top was made of glass , so that i could not see it .
here we viewed the making of a giant glass decorative ball . each small triangle piece was carefully put into place . the individual triangles made larger triangles which would then be put together as a large ball-like ornament . it was high anxiety waiting for that last piece to be put into place . the final outcome was amazing ; so decorative and elegant looking .

it was a difficult task to get out of the way . so that it was impossible for me to make a piece of wood . and put it on the top of a piece . and it was so high that you could see the top . it was built of glass , and the roof were covered with diamonds .
creating a geodesic dome out of glass is a painstaking process . the tiny triangles all have to be fitted together precisely . these , then , form larger triangles . which are then fitted together to make the dome . in the end , all that 's left is to take a picture of this unique structure .

11590523983 11591111666 11590760395 11590625934 11590622884
the roof was made of glass , and they were so high that it could not be seen . it was built of glass . and the roof of it was covered with diamonds . so that it was impossible for the roof to climb up and down . and the ceiling was so high , that it looked like a roof .
there is a mission to build something unique . a piece of art that really stands out . although it has taken time and piece by piece it seems to get harder , it still gets done . the men hold together a triangle base for each piece . careful to not drop the art , the men focus hard on the outcome . in conclusion the art piece stands tall and beautiful , proving that hard work goes a long way .
