young [female] , thus instructed in all that he was to do , advanced towards the door of the bagnio . the first thing he did was to light his torch like a slave . then mixing among them , as if he belonged to some nobleman of [male] . he marched along as they did , following hump back . who came out of the bagnio , and mounted a horse from the sultan 's own stable .
her sisters recognized her at once , filled with astonishment . mingled with no little alarm , they threw themselves at her feet . begging her pardon for all their former unkindness , she raised and embraced them . told them she forgave them with all her heart . and only hoped they would love her always , then she departed with the herald to the king 's palace .
the baron made a sign , and ten peasants ran to the cottage of [female] . who very obligingly lent them her gold tongs . they were put in the place of the trace . the coachman cracked his whip , and off went the carriage like a feather . everyone rejoiced , but the joy did not last long , a hundred steps farther , lo !
three guesses every night for a whole month ! she felt sure she would be able for so much ; and there was no other way out of the business . so she just said , `` yes , i agree , '' and lor , how that twirled its tail . and bowed , and smirked , and stuck out its beautiful toes , well , the very next day her husband led her to the strange room again . and there was the day 's food , and a spinning wheel and a great bundle of flax .
in our world , therefore , few would have much difficulty in accepting the propriety of a small portion of a large estate being left to a younger son . when the elder son is well provided for , nor , we learn . did a jury of her peers find any problem with this arrangement . lady mason , who had been a loyal , faithful , and attractive wife to old sir [male] . was acquitted of the crime of forgery , and she continued to live in the home place and raise their son to the age of majority when he might assume control of it .
and it did , then they hung a collar round his neck . and held a feather on which was written the name of the dove . and at last his memory came back to him , and he declared he would marry the princess and nobody else . so the next day the wedding took place . and they lived happy till they died .
for chairman they picked an old flongboo who was an umpire and used to umpire many mix ups . among the flongboos he was called `` the umpire of umpires , '' `` the king of umpires , '' `` the prince of umpires , '' `` the peer of umpires , '' when there was a fight and a snag and a wrangle between two families living next door neighbors to each other and this old flongboo was called in to umpire and to say which family was right and which family was wrong . which family started it and which family ought to stop it .
then the monkey got up and went to the dairy , and drank all the milk he could find . afterwards he returned home and married . and that is the last we heard of him , once upon a time there lived an old cobbler who worked hard at his trade from morning till night . and scarcely gave himself a moment to eat , but , industrious as he was . he could hardly buy bread and cheese for himself and his wife .
she wept and lamented so bitterly that at last the prince could refuse no longer . he drew his sword to cut off the cat 's head . but at the same time he closed his eyes that he might not see the cruel deed . when he opened his eyes again what was his wonder to see no cat . but a beautiful princess who stood before him smiling , never had he seen such beauty before .
a crow perishing with thirst saw a pitcher , and , hoping to find water . flew to it with great delight , when he reached it . he discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not possibly get at it . he tried everything he could think of to reach the water . but all his efforts were in vain , at last he collected as many stones as he could carry .
in a little they were startled by hearing a loud wailing shriek . and fearing some accident had happened to their favourite catriana , rushed out of the house to look after her . but no trace could they find of the poor , wilful [female] . her father and the lads were searching the whole night . and at the dawn of day they found her plaid at the side of the dreaded loch dorch .
a pretty polished walnut shell was her cradle , blue violet leaves were her mattress . and a rose leaf was her coverlet ; here she slept at night . but in the day she played upon the table . where the woman had set a plate , around which she placed quite a garland of flowers . the stalks of which were put in water , a large tulip leaf floated on the water .
but it was held in almost greater esteem than the principal residence of the moorish kings . for in a magnificent stable was lodged the ass on which the prophet mohamed was supposed to have ascended to paradise . it seems that the chosen quadruped , unaccustomed to the pastures of the mohamedan paradise . had escaped , and descended on earth close to the palace , or alcazar , at freixo . where he was found one morning by the dwellers when they were on their way to the mosque .
he then happened to look out of the window , good [male] ! how grand it was , there was something else than pine forests and [male] bushes to look at . for there was the finest garden anyone could wish for , with splendid trees and roses of all kinds . but he could not see a single human being , or even a cat . and that , you know , was rather lonely , for otherwise he had everything so grand and had been set up as his own master again .
when once ye have brought me into the muslim camp , added the old woman , i know how i will make shift to beguile them and slay them all . even to the last man , when the christians heard what she said . they kissed her hands and laid her in a chest . after they had beaten her grievously , in obedience to her commands .
we had the most delicious refreshments served up to us . and after eating , continued our conversation till night . we then had excellent wine brought up , and fruit adapted to promote drinking . and timed our cups to the sound of musical instruments . joined to the voices of the slaves , the lady of the house sung herself .
but while they were still in the midst of their feasting . a messenger arrived in great haste , his face was pale . and his teeth chattered with fear , even the knight turned pale at this news . but [male] him have no fear . `` i had intended to set out in search of this giant , ''
as my mother and the lady left the stairs . a statue of a young girl started into life . her marble flowers became fragrant and blooming , as she knelt to offer her upraised basket . my mother took a rose , and presented it to the lady . who placed a fair white [female] in her hand , then side by side they moved along .
and so , in truth , it was ; and they soon found that what they had taken for an immense wig was in reality the top of the cauliflower . and that he had no feet at all , being able to walk tolerably well with a fluctuating and graceful movement on a single cabbage stalk—an accomplishment which naturally saved him the expense of stockings and shoes . presently , while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust . he suddenly arose , and , in a somewhat plumdomphious manner , hurried off toward the setting sun—his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers . and a large number of water wagtails proceeding in advance of him by three and three in a row—till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand .
but he was deaf to her appeal . or unable to act as he had done in other places , [female] tormented herself half the night and slept the remainder . when she was awakened by a good-looking girl , who brought her a little food . telling her that it was sent her by the favourite of the fairy . her [female] , who was resolved to assist her .

when we saw this , we made no delay . but got immediately upon our rafts , and rowed off from the shore , the giants . who perceived this , took up great stones , and running to the shore entered the water up to their waists . and threw so exactly that they sank all the rafts but that i was upon . and all my companions , except the two with me , were drowned , we rowed with all our might .
it belonged to the powerful swabian duke [male] of hohenstaufen . whose young and valiant son loved this the best of all his father 's proud castles . and often left his uncle 's splendid palace to hunt in its forests . or to look down from its lofty oriel window on the blooming plain below . his father and uncle indeed missed him sadly .
once upon a time , something happened , if it had not happened . it would not be told , at the edge of the village . where the peasants oxen break through the hedges and the neighbors hogs wallow in the ground under the fences . there once stood a house , in this house lived a man .
on the fifth day , however , glad tidings came , [male] had landed . and sent word that he was bringing corn and meal as quickly as possible . also a wandering peasant brought a message that nine hundred oxen were within one day 's journey of her castle . and when the [female] heard this , and knew that her people were safe . she died with a smile on her lips and thanks to god for her people on her tongue .
as the cloak started off , traveling faster than he had ever known it to do . through sky land and cloud land . over freezing mountain tops , and desolate stretches of forest . and smiling cultivated plains , and great lakes that seemed to him almost as shoreless as the sea . he was often rather frightened , but he crouched down , silent and quiet ; what was the use of making a [male] ?
they obeyed , and that day caught him in a very wicked trick . two swallows had built their nest under the eaves of a farmer 's barn . but when they had completed it , and hatched their young , [male] stole up to the nest and loosened it from the barn . so that the tender young ones were shattered to pieces on the ground . whilst the mischievous prince was surveying the dying pangs of the wretched little birds .

as the king had no other child except that daughter . upon his death his son in law succeeded him upon the throne . thus they reached the highest glory of this world . may heaven grant that we may all reach the highest glory of the world to come ! two men were traveling in company on their way to a distant city .
so the seven princes rode through the wood until they came to the place where the seven princesses sat crying and wringing their hands . at the sight of them the young princes were very much astonished . and still more so on learning their story ; and they settled that each should take one of these poor forlorn ladies home with him . and marry her , so the first and eldest prince took the eldest princess home with him . and married her , and the seventh , and the handsomest of all , took the beautiful [female] .
they travelled along over the plain , and at last they came to the foot of the mountain that lay between them and the iron castle . so the prince and broad and long took shelter behind a clump of trees . and then [male] uncovered his eyes , he fixed his eyes on the mountain . and presently it began to groan and split and splinter , pieces of sharp rock and stones flew through the air . it was not long before [male] 's gaze had bored a way straight through the mountain and out on the other side .
during all these years i was a most diligent student of books . as well as a hard worker at my business , but i took great care not to mention to anyone the story concerning the discoveries made by my father and myself . even at this late day i would be fearful of having any one see or know the things i am writing . and the records and maps i have in my keeping . when my days on earth are finished , i shall leave maps and records that will enlighten and .
what am i to do ? even if i could have the bandy legged baby knocked up and brought here . i could offer him nothing but sherry . and that would be the death of him , he would never hold up his head again if he touched it , i can t go to bed , because i have conceived a mortal hatred for my bedroom . and i can t go away , because there is no train for my place of destination until morning .
from the narrow pass came the sound of bugles and the trampling of horses ', feet . therefore a little girl who was watching the geese hastened to drive them away from the bridge . before the whole hunting party came galloping up ; they came . however , so quickly , that the girl , in order to avoid being run over . placed herself on one of the high corner stones of the bridge .
during this interval , [female] frequented the shops of the principal merchants . where they sold cloth of gold and silver . linens , silk stuffs , and jewelry . and oftentimes joining in their conversation , acquired a knowledge of the world . and respectable demeanour , by his acquaintance among the jewellers .
`` she waits , '' exclaimed [female] , `` my princess waits ! '' he ran to her , his heart filled with dread lest she should again take flight . he reached her , and opened his box in haste . he took the magic veil from its shelter . and shook its transparent folds over the waiting flame .
he looked forward to his godmother 's surprise on his return . when he would tell her all that had happened to him and thereby gain great fame . he walked down from the box that held his castle and crossed the press straight to his godmother 's bed . he judged that the window through which the light was streaming . was in the east and that , therefore , he was going directly to the north .
now let [location] look back a moment , and see what had been going on in [female] 's native village all these years . and how her double had fared , it is a well-known fact that a bad woman seldom becomes better as she grows older . and [female] 's stepmother was no exception to the rule . but as the figure that had taken the girl 's place could feel no pain . the blows that were showered on her night and day made no difference .
all things here corresponded with each other , the motto was still everything in its right place . and therefore all the pictures which had been put up in the old house for honour and glory . hung now in the passage that led to the servants hall : they were considered as old lumber . and especially two old portraits , one representing a man in a pink coat and powdered wig .
it was only on nights when all in the crystal castle were fast asleep . and no discovery was to be feared , that the young nymph hastened to the little soul . opened her prison , by raising the edge of the bell . and rose with her for a sail in the lily boat . the boat reached its destination the night before easter .
the first leisure moment during the next day the boy got a pencil . and on the back of one of the other drawings he attempted to copy the drawing of the metal pig . and he succeeded , certainly it was rather crooked , rather up and down , one leg thick . and another thin , still it was like the copy . and he was overjoyed at what he had done , the pencil would not go quite as it ought .
but the farmer 's son would go his own way . and that was with limping [male] , and across the downs , so they started . and the fiddler had his fiddle in his hand . and a bundle of marketings under his arm . and he sang snatches of strange songs .
[male] was the son of a fisherman . but the fisherman had died when [male] was a little boy . [male] 's mother took in sewing and fancy work to earn money to support herself and her son . he helped her what he could out of school hours . and in vacation , he had two uncles who wad taught him how to catch shrimps .
of furniture , with the exception of the cabinets . chests , and boxes , large and small , of this famous lac . there appears to have been little , until the japanese developed a taste for copying european customs and manners . the habit seems to have been to sit on [person] and to use small tables raised a few inches from the ground . even the bedrooms contained no bedsteads , but a light mattress served for bed and bedstead .
from the second a silver one ; and from the third a glittering gold one . she was highly delighted , and at once locked the two walnuts in which the gold and silver dresses were . safely in a cupboard , she put on the copper dress . hurried off to church , and sat down in the last pew all among the old women , and lo ! the whole congregation stood up to admire her , so that the clergyman was obliged to stop in his sermon .
now , iron is very hard ; it requires more rubbing than any other metal . i once chafed a genie out of an anvil . but i was quite weary before i got him all out ; the slightest irritation of a leaden water pipe would have fetched the same genie out of it like a rat from his hole . but having planted all his [male] , sown his potatoes , and set out his wheat . [male] had the whole summer before him .
they placed him on the table , and there no ! what curious things may happen in the world , the tin soldier was in the very room in which he had been before ! he saw the same children , and the same toys stood upon the table . and there was the pretty castle with the graceful little dancer , she was still balancing herself on one leg and held the other extended in the air . she was faithful , too , that moved the tin soldier .
undoubtedly -- and especially since the invention of psychological tests to determine the mental state of dullards . many children have been erroneously pronounced feeble minded when their backwardness is in reality due to remediable causes . the trouble is not with the tests so much as with the inexperience of those who apply them . some of the tests being seemingly so easy of application that in many instances they have been utilised by teachers and others having little or no training in clinical psychology . this is particularly true concerning the application of the much talked about binet simon method of mental diagnosis .
this exclamation of [male] excited the prince 's curiosity . he opened his eyes and looked at him . [male] , who had a ready wit , seized that opportunity . and made his compliment in extempore verse ; but in such a disguised manner . that neither the king nor the grand vizier under stood his meaning .
so every day she had to take the asses to the woods to feed . until one morning , exactly a year after she had found the lion . she heard a groan which sounded quite human , she went straight to the place from which the noise came . and , to her great surprise , beheld the same lion stretched on the ground with a deep wound across his face . this time she was not afraid at all , and ran towards him .
he heard a single knight riding before the others . and soon saw his figure issue from the gloom with couched lance . and sir [male] made him ready also , resolved to sell his life dearly at the last . `` i am the little king , '' said the other , and rode swiftly towards sir [male] . then he leaped from his horse and came to the stirrup of his chief .
one day , when there had been a heavy shower and a beautiful rainbow . he and flax were out in the garden tying up some rose bushes . which the rain had beaten down , and he said to her how he wished he could find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow . flax , if you will believe me . had never heard of it ; so he had to tell her all about it .
the queen and the court could not remember , but the king . who was a wise fairy , instantly remembered , with that he grasped his tiny sword and flew to the side of the princess and lifted her hand in his . and with a swift , deft stroke he cut from her wrist the bracelet that was like a fetter . and he took her in his arms . first of all there was every day , with breakfast , lunch , outdoors .
when evening came , the old mother put some bread into her bag . and a few of those kindling chips which the poor girl had given her . and then she went weeping and sobbing out of her son 's house . up jumped the wicked daughter in law , overjoyed , and fetched their fur coats . and they dressed and followed the old woman from afar .
and when the lombarder had looked on the linden he began to laugh loud . now list what he said then : `` there never yet from tree came so sweet breathing a wind .

another time , [female] went out and hid himself and his sack in a wheat field . and there caught two splendid fat partridges in the same manner as he had done the rabbit . when he presented them to the king . with a similar message as before , his majesty was so pleased that he ordered the cat to be taken down into the kitchen and given something to eat and drink . where , while enjoying himself , the faithful animal did not cease to talk in the most cunning way of the large preserves and abundant game which belonged to his lord the marquis of carabas .
so in routine the days passed by until autumn was near at hand . one day , returning before the sun was fully set , he found seated beside his mother a lovely girl . in spite of his contemptible appearance after a day 's [female] . working barelegged in the mire , she welcomed him with the [male] of a princess . not thinking of returning the salute in his unwashed condition , he took off his head kerchief .
and then , as the servant went back with the message , the whole crew on the flying ship set to their singing again . and sang and laughed and made jokes as if they had not a care in the world . during the night , while the others slept , the peasant with the fagot of wood went hither and thither . scattering his sticks , instantly where they fell there appeared a gigantic army . nobody could count the number of soldiers in it .
in a high order of ideas , what great facts serve as a foundation to our history and that of the modern world ! we have first royalty , which , weak and debased under the merovingians . rises and establishes itself energetically under pépin and [person] . to degenerate under [person] le débonnaire and [person] . after having dared a second time to found the empire of the caesars .
the next question is , what is the best time for seeing fairies ? i believe i can tell you all about that , the first rule is . that it must be a very hot day -- that we may consider as settled . and you must be just a little sleepy -- but not too sleepy to keep your eyes open , mind . well , and you ought to feel a little -- what one may call fairyish -- the scotch call it eerie ,
but who was to go ? that was the question , for it was black midnight . and the way to the old woman 's house lay straight through the glen . and whoever travelled that road ran the risk of meeting the dreaded [male] . the farmer would have gone only too willingly , but he dare not leave his wife alone . and the servants stood in groups about the kitchen .
at the last by misfortune sir [male] unhorsed sir [male] . and smote him through the shield into the side . and the spear brake , and the head was left still in his side . but sir lavaine by great force took the horse from the king of scots and brought it to his lord . sir [male] , and in spite of them all he made him to mount upon that horse .
the magic moccasins leaped a hundred yards at each step . they carried [male] along faster than a bird can fly . the buffaloes had gone at full speed , and had had the start of him by several hours . but so swiftly he went that by twilight he found himself close to their camp . here he slipped the moccasins from his feet .
then the devil said that if [male] still wished to enter his service . he would take him , the work would be light . the devil said , and the hours good , and if [male] did as he was told he would have a pleasant time . the devil promised to keep him seven years and at the end of that time to make him a handsome present and set him free . [male] shook hands on the bargain and the devil .
the great day so impatiently expected at length arrived , for six weeks the good people of wild oats had been in a fever of excitement . nothing more was heard of ministers , senators , generals . magistrates , princesses , duchesses , and citizens . for twenty leagues round , clowns , harlequins . punchinellos , gipsies , columbines , and follies alone were to be seen .
after this , they lay down to sleep , and while they were lying there it was so dark that no one could see his own hand . all at once the one with the cat 's eyes awoke . aroused the others , and said , `` brothers , just look up , do you see the white mice running about there ? '' the two sat up , but could see nothing , then said he , things are not right with us . we have not got back again what is ours , we must return to the innkeeper .
to please him every means she would take . and a pudding large did for him make ; but in trying to obtain a sip . into the batter did he slip , the batter in the pot went plump . [male] made the pudding skip and jump ! his mother , with affright , did this espy , and gave it to a [male] passing by .
after a time a beautiful girl thrust aside the lotus flowers and came into the open . it was rose of evening , they looked at each other with happy timidity . and each told how each had longed for the other , and they also told each other of their former life . then they weighted the lotus leaves with stones so that they made a cozy retreat . in which they could be together , and promised to meet each other there every evening .

he sat down under the lintel upon the stone . there never was a bolder minstrel , when the sweet tones sounded from his strings . the proud homeless ones all thanked him . he struck so loud that the house echoed . great were his skill and strength both , then he played sweeter and softer .
the [male] of the last twelve hours was doing more for prince [male] . than could have been acquired in as many years at his father 's court . the course of self examination upon which the usage he had received in fairy land had caused him to enter was of more real value to him than all the jewels in his future crown . the sharp and trying process by which he was now in progress of being taught the defects of his character . was a more certain evidence of the good-will of his fairy godmother towards him .
on the eighth night a fearful storm of wind and rain came on while the herd boy was on his way to bring the beautiful girl another bag of gold . then for the first time he noticed , just as he reached his master 's house . that he had forgotten the belt which made him invisible . he did not like the idea of going back to his hut in the wind and wet . so he just stepped as he was into the girl 's room .
no wonder that the child , used only to tenderness , looked fearfully upon that pale . dark face , grown prematurely old , her hair still hung over her shoulders . a long and tangled mass , all its purple luster . all its beauty gone forever , there was a strange , wild look about the eyes . and under them a dark , sunken circle .
beans of a big coarse growing sort . with large pods from eight to 18 inches long , are planted by women about [person] by the garden fences of the potato and [person] gardens . and allowed to creep up these fences , they furnish edible fruit in about three or four months from the time of planting . and are then gathered by the women , only the inside seeds are eaten . and even these are so hard that twenty -- four hours boiling does not soften them .
[male] sends you this as a wedding gift ! and he whirled the hammer about his head . then hurled it once , twice , thrice , as it rebounded to his hand . and in the first stroke , as of lightning , [male] rolled dead from his throne . in the second stroke perished the whole giant household .
scarcely had the last word fallen from the enchanter 's mouth . when the dancing witch fires hurried toward him from all sides of the marsh . soon a pale road leading across the bog to the castle stood revealed . an enchanted road which melted away behind the riders as smoke melts into the winter air . to the very gates of his castle did the ghost fires accompany the enchanter .
but the prince was not allowed to live an idle life long , when he was about thirty years old . news was brought that the ainu race . the aborigines of the islands of [location] . who had been conquered and pushed northwards by the japanese , had rebelled in the eastern provinces . and leaving the vicinity which had been allotted to them were causing great trouble in the land .
then [male] , his head thrown back , gazed in the bold eyes of [male] . son of [male] he was indeed . as he looked with royal scorn at those whom he despised . still quivering with anger , [male] went down to the blue sea that gently whispered its secrets to the shore on which he stood . for , like many a boy before and since , [male] had dreamed of gallant , fearless deeds .
there was a great deal of weeping , imploring , and wailing in the royal palace . but all in vain ; the king promised a sack full of gold . but all in vain , the king of the wolves . heedless of any words , urged on the pack by howling at them continually . `` drive on , seize them , '' the king promised more .
the journey over the heath and the deep sand was only too quickly at an end . they stopped before the house of mourning . where they found plenty of guests within and without . [person] after [person] stood side by side . while the horses and oxen had been turned out to graze on the scanty pasture .
sunny days succeeded to nights filled with golden dreams . when the first sunbeams flashed from the summit of the glacier . the goat bells sounded below in the valley , and the goat herd led his flock to seek the juicy plants that grew on heights inaccessible to less sure footed herds . then [male] ran joyfully to meet him , for he always brought some message from [male] . or some other token of his love , with joy quickened energy she went then about her daily [female] .
the squire first went unto [male] , and asked him whether he were sore wounded or not . `` yea , forsooth , '' said he . `` i shall escape hard from death , '' then the squire fetched his horse . and brought him with great pain unto an abbey . then was he taken down safely , and unarmed , and laid in a bed .
the king went in front , and after him all the grand people . counts , dukes , barons , and so on . the poor man came out and received the king with the great personages very kindly . and conducted them all to the head of the table as their fitting place . they ate , drank , and caroused , so that it was like a small wedding .
he found [male] sorrowfully seated under some trees . but when she saw him she was so pleased that she scarcely knew how to welcome him . old [female] learned from her spies that [female] had returned . and that the princess , having washed her face with the dancing water . had become more lovely than ever , finding this , she lost no time in artfully making the princess sigh for the wonderful singing apple .
there great rejoicings were taking place , and the bear hunters . asking what it was all about , were told that it was because prince [male] . the torment of his subjects , had just been struck dead by a [male] . just punishment of all his crimes , four courtiers . his wicked companions , had wished to divide his throne between them .
all went on mighty well until , by dad , the goose got stricken in years like her master . and could not divert him no longer , and then it was that the poor king was lost entirely . the king was walkin one mornin by the edge of the lake , lamentin his cruel fate , and thinking of drowning himself . that could get no diversion in life , when all of a sudden , turning round the corner .
once upon a time there was a hunter who went out into the forest to shoot game . he had a wife and two dogs . his wife was for ever asking questions , so that he was glad to get away from her into the forest . and she did not like dogs , and said they were always bringing dirt into the house with their muddy paws . so that the dogs were glad to get away into the forest with the hunter .
grandmother is so old , she has so many wrinkles . and her hair is quite white ; but her eyes , they shine like two stars . nay , they are much finer -- they are so mild , so blissful to look into . and then she knows the most amusing stories , and she has a gown with large . large flowers on it , and it is of such thick silk that it actually rustles .
grotesque dwarfs , carrying lighted torches . appeared on all sides , saluted and welcomed their king [male] as they illumined the road for him and his attendants . then for the first time the girl knew she had married [female] . but this mattered little to her , on coming out from these gloomy passages into the open they found themselves surrounded by large forests and mountains . mountains that seemed to touch the sky , and , strange to relate , all the trees of whatsoever kind .
since bifröst was broken , the asir and the vanir . the asyniur and the vana , the einherjar and the valkyries rode downward to vigard through the waters of thund . [male] rode at the head of his champions . his helmet was of gold and in his hand was his spear gungnir . [male] and [male] were in his company .
no , [female] could not see , nor did he intend to let go until he found out what was holding the loop of the lasso . so he resorted to an old trick his father had taught him and . putting the butcher 's horse to a run . began riding in a circle around the spot where his lasso had caught . as he thus drew nearer and nearer his quarry he saw the rope coil up .
on arriving at glen cannel , the arrow was given him to throw . pretending to aim at the woman he threw it through the window and killed a pet lamb . the animal at once came out through the window , but he was told this would not do . he must throw again , he did so , and the woman was taken away and a log of alder wood was left in her place . the weaver claimed his agreement , and the fairies left the woman with him at the bridge of awe .
julian got through his letters at breakfast and after , breakfast with [male] 's help . amongst the letters was one from mount pleasant mission enclosing a card . `` hunter 's mad , '' said [male] crossly . he tore up the envelope viciously , but he did not tear up the card it contained . he placed that in his pocket book carefully , [male] looked at him in interrogation .
it rested on the loftiest cliffs of the island . and there they fixed their residence , they all resumed their natural shapes . but they were diminished to the size of fairies . and as a mark of homage to the king of the evening star . they never failed on every pleasant evening during the summer season to join hands and dance upon the top of the rocks .
then the tsar [male] asked his daughter what it all meant . and begged her to explain the mystery , and when the princess [female] had related to him all that had passed . [male] tsarevich was placed at the table beside her . and his squire was shot at the gate for his treacherous conduct . [female] married the princess , and returned with her to his father 's kingdom .
but even royalty did not always live in rooms of state . for at versailles , and petit trianon . there is much simple exquisite furniture , the wonderful and elaborate furniture of the past must be studied of course . but to the majority of people , then as now , the simpler expression of its fundamental lines of beauty are more satisfactory . the trouble with many houses is that their furnishings are copied from too grand models .
and what do you think he saw there ? not a single fruit tree was any longer green . the stems , branches , and twigs stood there as if some one had stripped them naked . the fallen leaves had turned the ground into a crackling carpet . only a single rose bush was still covered with leaves and full of buds . some wide open and some half closed , to reach this rose bush the [male] had to tread very gingerly on the tips of his toes .
and death gave back each of these treasures for a song . and the nightingale went on singing , it sang about the quiet churchyard . when the roses bloom , where the elder flower scents the air . and where the fresh grass is ever moistened anew by the tears of the mourner . this song brought to death a longing for his own garden .
an attendant was sent to fetch the great court account tablets . which were made of ivory inlaid with silver . and the king offered [male] his own golden pencil with rubies and diamonds round the top . [male] was very frightened , he didn t at all like the idea of a dungeon . so there was nothing for it but to brave it out as best he might .
the bird flew and [female] followed , it took no long flights . but went from tree to tree , it was as if it understood that [male] wished to follow . for always , before flying further , it waited till the boy had come to the foot of the tree on which it rested . such a journey as he made , for in a short time the bird had left the woodland trail and was flying cross-country . where there was no path to make [male] 's progress less difficult .
when he had eaten heartily , even to the last crumb , [male] arose and took his butterfly net in hand . `` farewell , noble youth , '' cried mine host . with tears in his eyes , for [male] had paid his score generously . and the landlord did not expect to see the little fellow again , the landlord 's fair daughter . [female] , stood weeping , with the corner of her apron to her eyes .
`` oh , not so soon , not so soon , '' cried [female] , bursting into tears . which made the field mouse very angry , and declare that [female] had no more sense than other girls . and did not know what was good for her , then the mole arrived , and carried her on his back to see the new house he had dug for her . which was so very far under ground that [female] 's tiny legs could never bring her up even as high as the field mouse 's dwelling . from which she might see the sunlight , her heart grew heavier and heavier as the days went by .
men said that this was because [male] 's father had been a fairy . and not a denizen of earth , who had bequeathed to his son the gift of perpetual youth . but nobody knew whether this were true or not , for the dwarf had inhabited the [organization] stone long before the oldest man or woman in hoy had been born . one thing was certain , however : he had inherited from his mother . whom all men agreed had been mortal , the dangerous qualities of vanity and ambition .
but as he looked on the hoard [male] felt some shadow of the evil that lay over it all . this was the hoard that in the far-off days the river maidens watched over as it lay deep under the flowing water . then [male] the dwarf forced the river maidens to give it to him . and [male] had taken it from [male] . letting loose as he did [male] the witch who had such evil power over the gods .
at last when nine daughters in all had been born to the forester 's wife and lost to her when they were but a year old . the queen fell very ill. every day she grew weaker and weaker . and the little prince came and sat by her , holding her hand and looking at her with a sorrowful face . at last one night ( it was just a year after the last of the forester 's children had disappeared ) . she woke suddenly , stretching out her arms and crying .
lily discovered that it never rained , but snowed white sugar , there was no sun . as it would have been too hot ; but a large yellow lozenge made a nice moon . and red and white comfits were the stars , the people all lived on sugar . and never quarrelled , no one was ill ; and if any got broken , as sometimes happened with such brittle creatures . they just stuck the parts together and were all right again , the way they grew old was to get thinner and thinner till there was danger of their vanishing .
`` what is wrong with you , friend , that you do not see where you are going ? '' cried the eldest of the three ; and when [male] told them of his fruitless errand . they at once invited him to help himself to their treasure . `` take all you can hold in your hand , '' they urged . and since [male] hand had been much broadened with honest [male] .
she flung herself on her knees to implore [male] . but he cut her in four pieces . there remained only the lady , who was quite ignorant of all that was taking place around her . he sought her through the house . and when at last he found her , she nearly fainted with terror at the sight of him .
`` no , there it is , my dear , '' said the queen . when she likewise saw a door with a cross . `` but here is one , and there is another , '' they all exclaimed . wherever they looked there was a cross on the door . then they realised that the sign would not help them at all .
from the crowd close by the lofty houses she looked forth over the terrific stream beyond the rows of trees . yonder heaved a stream of rolling carriages . cabriolets , coaches , omnibuses , cabs . and among them riding gentlemen and marching troops . to cross to the opposite shore was an undertaking fraught with danger to life and limb .
the subsequent doings of mr. [male] fully established the opinion of duncan . although he had been in imminent danger of having his crime discovered . yet , when those who conducted the inquiry had left the vicinity , the lord of [male] . with renewed energy and more resolute determination , carried on his nefarious calling , in each succeeding winter . vessels were wrecked in [male] bay which had been decoyed thither by the false lights he had caused to be placed in the tower .
begonies , he made the big faggot dance home . with himself sitting on it , the next giant was a beautiful boy with three heads on him . he had neither prayers nor catechism no more nor the others . and so he gave [male] a bottle of green ointment . that would not let you be burned , nor scalded , nor wounded , `` and now , ''
gopher is supposed to mean cypress wood . see notes on woods , folding stool . faldistory or faldstool -- a portable seat . similar to a camp stool , of wood or metal covered with silk or other material . it was used by a bishop when officiating in other than his own cathedral church .
from this period gowns with tight bodices were generally adopted ; the women wore over them a tight jacket . reaching to a little below the hips , often trimmed with fur when the gown was richly ornamented . and itself richly ornamented when the gown was plain , they also began to plait the hair . which fell down by the side of the face to the neck . and they profusely decorated it with pearls or gold or silver ornaments .
but during the night , the first after the sister 's death . while the brother was sleeping in his bed , close to where he had placed the fragrant [male] . every flower cup opened , and invisibly the little spirits stole out . armed with poisonous spears , they placed themselves by the ear of the sleeper . told him dreadful dreams and then flew across his lips .
he took his dinner alone , but always looked forward to the evening meal when he could sit down and talk with his godmother . one evening , when they were sitting together and little [male] was speaking of all the things in the world he would like to do . his godmother said , » dear little [male] , before you can do great things in the world . it is necessary that you should learn how to read and write as large people do . so that you can know what they are doing « .
in a little while the bird flew into the room , still with his eyes fixed on the king . and at every glance the strength of the sick man became greater . till he was once more as well as he used to be before the queen died . filled with joy at his cure , he tried to seize the bird to whom he owed it all . but , swifter than a swallow , it managed to avoid him .
every morning this prodigiously great giant walked round the world before breakfast . looking for something to eat , he lived in fine style . and his dinners were most magnificent , consisting of an elephant roasted whole , ostrich patties . a [male] smothered in onions , stewed lions . and whale soup , but for a side dish .
lingering a moment uncertainly near the gate of a small garden enclosure . he felt himself caught by [male] hands and drawn toward a house . judging this to be very much to the purpose , [female] followed , but when the girl saw the tall figure in tartans instead of the sweetheart she had expected . she dropped the candle she had lighted . and called out for her father , a stout westmoreland peasant at once appeared .
poor [female] ran after him but was unable to catch him . for [male] ran in leaps and bounds . his two wooden feet , as they beat on the stones of the street . making as much noise as twenty peasants in wooden shoes . `` catch him , catch him ! ''
they carried her back to the palace and put her to bed . but as soon as she recovered enough to be able to speak , she began to scold and rage . and declared that the whole affair was [female] 's fault . that she had contrived it on purpose to try and get rid of her . and that if the king would not have her punished , she would go back to her castle and enjoy her riches by herself .
i listened with grave attention , then i gave him some bread and sausages . and he ate away ravenously , how ever many cups of tea did he drink afterwards ? the above was all the avowal that [male] made to me . i do not think that he said nearly as much to [male] as he did to me . [male] plied me with questions that night .
meanwhile , a messenger had ridden off posthaste with the tidings . and while the doctors were still consulting and shaking their heads the king himself came galloping home to the palace . in the midst of his grief he bethought him of what the fairies had foretold . and being persuaded that , since they had said it , this was fated to happen . he blamed no one but gave orders to carry the princess to the finest apartment in the palace .
she said further , that if he who had delivered her would take her in marriage . she would be his , if not , she would go into a nunnery . and he could marry no other as long as she lived , for he was wedded to her with the service of the dead . which he had heard , she was now the most beautiful young princess that anyone could wish to see . and he was now lord of half the kingdom , which had been promised him for standing on guard the third nigh .
the whole countryside was now taking a deep interest in the affair . the aged did not wish to die without beholding the consummation of the love they had seen [female] in their youth . and the young did not wish to die at all , but no one liked to interfere . it was feared that counsel to the woman would be rejected . and a thrashing to the man would be misunderstood , at last the parson took heart of [male] to make or [male] the match .
when six of his heads were gone the snake lashed his tail with such fury that the gazelle and the old woman could not see each other for the dust he made . and the gazelle said to him , you have climbed all sorts of trees . but this you can t climb , and as the seventh head came darting through it went rolling to join the rest . then the sword fell rattling on the ground , for the gazelle had fainted . the old woman shrieked with delight when she saw her enemy was dead .
`` my friend , be a winter gauk . '' she had twitted him with the summer . yes , all this was in the verses , and the paper was folded up like a letter . and the flower was folded in the letter , too , it was dark around her . dark as in those days when she lay hidden in the bulb .
i clapped my hand to the bag . concluding the silk twist might be the string of a purse within : in the mean time a porter . with a load of wood upon his back . passed by on the other side of the horse so near , that the rider was forced to turn his head towards him . to avoid being hurt , or having his clothes torn by the wood , in that moment the devil tempted me .
the second wife brought him a daughter . but the child of the first wife was a little son . and was as red as blood , and as white as snow , when the wife looked at her daughter . she loved her ; but when she looked at the little boy . she hated him , and it seemed as if he were always in her way .
their skeletons rattled in every breeze , so that the terrified birds never dared to venture into the garden . all the flowers were supported by human bones instead of sticks . and human skulls in the flower pots grinned horribly , it was really a doleful garden for a princess . do you see all this ? said the old king ; your fate will be the same as those who are here . therefore do not attempt it , you really make me very unhappy .
while the postmaster went on with such provoking answers to these appeals for despatch . [female] 's eye caught the heap of letters which lay on the counter . so , while certain weighing of soap and tobacco was going forward . he contrived to become possessed of two letters from the heap . and , having effected that , waited patiently enough until it was the great man 's pleasure to give him the missive directed to his master .
the words make her look round . she had seen no black casket , but as the cats continued their cry she peered into several corners that had remained unnoticed . and at length discovered a little black box , so small and so black , that it might easily have been passed over . `` this is the casket that pleases me best , [female] , '' said the girl , carrying it into the house .
she continued her painting and the exhibition of her pictures at the royal academy . she made illustrations for the works of virgil . [female] , [female] , and other poets . and painted portraits of interesting and distinguished persons , among whom were [female] . le brun and [female] , récamier .
thanking the old man of the sea , and begging his pardon for having squeezed him so roughly . the hero resumed his journey , he met with a great many strange adventures . which would be well worth your hearing , if i had leisure to narrate them as minutely as they deserve . it was in this journey , if i mistake not , that he encountered a prodigious giant . who was so wonderfully contrived by nature that , every time he touched the earth .
upon this intelligence , the sultan of casgar sent a hussar to the place of execution . go , said he to the messenger , make all the haste you can . bring the arraigned persons before me immediately , with the corpse of poor crump back . that i may see him once more , accordingly the hussar went . and happened to arrive at the place of execution at the time when the executioner was going to tie up the tailor .
in the time of the illustrious [male] , it was indeed a pleasure to be a king . the laws were just , the people obedient . and peace was over the land , this monarch would have been the happiest of men . but for the continual complaints of his consort , which tore his very heart in twain . she wept continually for her daughters , nineteen of whom had perished in the flower of youth .
now it happened that the prince , wishing to have the [male] blade mounted . sent for [male] and entrusted it to his care . ordering him to employ the most cunning workmen in the manufacture of the scabbard hilt and ornaments . and [male] , having received the blade , took it home . and put it carefully away , when [male] heard of this .
the children were always together by the elder tree and under the willow . and the little girl sang the most beautiful songs with a voice that was clear as a bell . [male] , on the other hand , had not a note of music in him . but he knew the words of the songs . and that , at least , was something , the people of kjöge .
during the whole summer poor little tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest , she wove herself a bed with blades of grass . and hung it up under a broad leaf , to protect herself from the rain . she sucked the honey from the flowers for food . and drank the dew from their leaves every morning . so passed away the summer and the autumn , and then came the winter .
she told him that , having seen him . she willingly obeyed her father in this matter . after the wedding had taken place [female] led her into the hall . where a feast was spread , and she supped with him . after which they danced till midnight .
terrible and almost superhuman was the contest which now followed : the awful sea woman flung [male] down on his back and stabbed at him with point and edge of her broad knife . seeking some vulnerable point ; but the good corslet resisted all her efforts . and [male] , exerting his mighty force . overthrew her and sprang to his feet , angered beyond measure . he brandished the flaming sword hrunting .
spring went by , and summer drew towards its close , autumn came . but he had not decided , the flowers now appeared in their most gorgeous robes . but all in vain ; they had not the fresh , fragrant air of youth . for the heart asks for fragrance , even when it is no longer young . and there is very little of that to be found in the dahlias or the dry chrysanthemums .
rabbi lion rushed out in a state of alarm . the monster had slipped from the house and was battering down the door of the synagogue . for many years afterward these pieces were shown to visitors in the attic of the synagogue when the story was told of the rabbi 's bogey man . once upon a time there lived a man of learning and wealth who had an only son , named [male] . to this son , who was grown up and married , he sent a messenger asking that he should immediately come to his father .
in the morning he found the bow all right . but the witch 's jaws were badly swollen , [female] laughed at her and asked what was the matter and she said that she had toothache . so [male] went on his way rejoicing and at last reached the place where the wild buffaloes rested at night . he waited there and while he waited he swept away all the droppings and made the place clean . and then climbed up into a tree , at evening great herds of buffaloes came to the place and they were so many that [male] was afraid to shoot .
at length [female] reached the edge of the wood . and , oh , joy , there was her father 's house beside the blue lake . then the little man , smiling , bade her good-bye , and laughing merrily , he trotted away . and was soon lost to sight among the trees , once upon a time there lived a man named [male] . one evening , when he was on his way to a distant village .
it has been called sigillaria , because it has marks like seals all up the trunk . due to the scars left by the leaves when they fell from the tree . you will see the sigillarias on the left hand side of the coal forest picture . having those curious tufts of leaves springing out of them at the top . their stems make up a great deal of the coal .
poor [female] was making a pretense of being in good spirits . but in reality he was beginning to feel discouraged ; his strength was failing . he was gasping and panting for breath , he could do no more . and the shore was still far off , he swam until he had no breath left . then he turned his head to [male] and said in broken words ?
in the reign of king [male] i. there dwelt in [location] . near the vast expanse of the fens , a noble gentleman . sir [male] of the marches , he was now old . but was still a model of all courtesy and a `` very perfect [male] knight . '' he had three sons , of whom the youngest , [male] , was born in his father 's old age .
this time he had run across the river a mile above the lachine rapids in an indian war canoe . and landed in a cove surrounded by reefs , where pursuit was impossible . it had been a perilous undertaking , for he had had to make his way right through the swift current of thelawrence . the turbulent rapids so near that it seemed as if indeed he must yield life to the raging cataract . but with indomitable courage he had forged ahead , the canoe .
cinderella smiled as she helped them to dress . she was sure the fairy would let her go to the ball too . and she was right , her godmother , pleased with her obedience . came in good time , and [male] , dressed in blue satin and pearls . went in the same style as before , the prince would scarcely let her out of his sight .
poor [male] tuft was very much confused , for to him the young [male] was the first dream of beauty that had kindled the dawning fire of manhood in his heart . and he was ready to bow down and kiss her foot prints in the sand . strange to say , the little [female] swayed the grandmother as absolutely as she had ruled the dwarf and [female] tuft . but in one respect the old woman was resolute . the heavy gate was locked as securely upon [female] as upon the other inmates of the mansion .
when dawn began to stir , they came to where the mulgar path widened awhile . here many rock conies dwelt that have , as it were , wings of skin with which they leap as if they flew . and here the travellers doused their torches , set [female] down . and made breakfast , while they all sat eating together , on a narrow pass beneath them wound by another of the long haired companies of the men of the mountains . from upper path to lower was about fifteen mulgars deep , for that is how they measure their heights .
the prince went to dress for the occasion , for he was resolved to die like a prince . when the princess heard that a man had offered to die for her . she was so transported that she jumped off the bed . feeble as she was , and danced about the room for joy . she did not care who the man was ; that was nothing to her .
this so exasperated the giant that he raised his hand to strike her . but she escaped and went to bed , leaving him to count over his treasure by way of amusement . the giant took his bags , and after turning them over and over to see they were in the same state he had left them . began to count their contents , first the bag which contained the silver was emptied . and the contents placed upon the table , [male] viewed the glittering heaps with delight .
the demon of evil , with his fierce ravening . greedily grasped them when dawn broke , and the danes from their dwellings around the hall entered heorot . great was the lamentation , and dire the dismay , for thirty noble champions had vanished . and the blood stained tracks of the monster showed but too well the fate that had overtaken them . [male] 's grief was profound , for he had lost thirty of his dearly loved bodyguard .
it was a pleasant night on which the two men set out . [female] had a rig waiting at the corner of the street . tie co , dressed in citizen 's clothes . stepped into it unobserved , and the smuggler and would be smuggled were soon out of the city . they had a merry drive , for [male] 's liking for tie co was very real .
next day he asked had she the bread ready . she said she had , and she was crying bitterly all the time . `` i am going to leave you now , mother , '' said he . `` and i will come back when i have found my three sisters , '' he went away . and walked on till he was tired and hungry ; and then he sat down to eat the bread that his mother had given him .
soon after , the second sister came up , meaning also to pluck out one of the golden feathers . but she had hardly touched her sister when she found herself held fast . so she ran up , but as soon as she touched her sisters she had to stay hanging on to them . and they all had to pass the night like this , in the morning . simpleton took up the goose under his arm .
very unwillingly the old witch opened a cupboard close by filled with bottles and jars . and took down one and held it out to the young man , but he was on the watch for trickery . and examined it carefully , and saw that it had no power to heal . this happened many times , till at length she found it was no use . and gave him the one he wanted .
this sight only increased the [male] of the prince , for he did not know where the castle was . nor how to set about finding it , however , he resolved to seek the whole world through till he came to the right place . he began by setting sail in a favourable wind . but his bad luck followed him even on the sea . he had scarcely lost sight of the land when a violent storm arose .
now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most beautiful ring . and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this [male] servant . who was allowed to go everywhere , the king ordered the man to be brought before him . and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief . he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed , in vain he declared his innocence .
dicky duck by this time was very brave , for what had he to fear from so small a creature as the eatyoup . so he swam right up to the side of the pond and out bounced mr. [male] and almost caught him . if [male] had not used his wings as well as his feet he would not have escaped . but he was in the middle of the pond . swimming for dear life , by the time mr. [male] was in the water .
now the king of the north had a beautiful daughter called crystal . her eyes were bright like the stars ; her hair was black like the sky at night . and her skin was as white as the snow which covered the ground outside the palace where she lived . which was built entirely of crystals clear as the clearest glass . and the king of the south had a son who had been named [male] on account of his brightness and warmth of heart .
the [female] , the woman 's camote stick . is about two feet long and an inch in diameter . it is a heavy , compact wood , and is used by the woman until worn down six or eight inches . when it usually becomes the property of a small girl for gathering wild plants for the family pigs , the su wan of the woman of [female] and [female] comes .
the [person] igorot assisted the insurrectos in many ways when they first came . about two miles west of [person] is a spanish rifle pit . and there the spanish soldiers , now swelled to about 600 men , lay in wait for the insurrectos . there on two hilltops an historic sham battle occurred . the two forces were nearly a mile apart , and at that distance they exchanged rifle bullets three days .
the dwarfs opened their circle to admit her . and [female] recognised by the flickering light the noble lady who had a few days before paid them so unlooked for a visit . her sky blue robe and the gold in her hair gleamed with even more than their former brilliance . she stepped up to the rock , threw her arms round the cold stone . and remained so for a moment in a silent embrace , suddenly the stone acquired life and motion .
off ran one and told the queen , who came and looked and looked , and wondered and wondered . until by and by she longed for the golden hen and the golden chickens as she had never longed for anything in all of her life before . so she called one of her maids , and sent her down to ask the strange woman the price of her golden chickens . so down went the young queen to the wicked step mother ; and what is the price of your hen and chicks . my good woman , said she , for she did not know the other .
whenever sir [male] had come home with new wine . and after the labels had been pasted on the casks , then [male] . with [male] beside him , had these carefully set down in the cellar . which was a vast dim room , the ceilings supported by heavy arches . the barrels , bins , kegs , hogsheads .
when the banquet was at an end , the chamberlains gave notice to [female] . who had been bound with ropes made of plaited grass to the trunk of a wide spreading oak . the fiddle struck up a tune , and at once the dance began . such a mad and merry dance the wondering children had never seen before ! old and young joined hands and trod a circle , then , breaking the chain .
when he got beyond the town he took out his golden apple . and when the horse sprang out he swung himself into the saddle . then he took the silver and the copper apples . and with all these fine soldiers he joined the king 's army . the king saw them approach with fear in his heart .
after admiring the mingled colours of the apple resembling the hue upon the cheek of the beloved maid and the sallow countenance of the perplexed and timid lover . the sweet smelling quince diffusing an odour like musk and ambergris . and the plum shining as the [female] , i retired from this place . and , having locked the door , opened that of the next closet , within which i beheld a spacious tract planted with numerous palm trees . and watered by a river flowing among rose trees , and [female] .
directly [male] perceived that the giant was fast asleep , he pushed open the door of the wardrobe and crept out . very softly he stole across the room , and , picking up the hen . made haste to quit the apartment , he knew the way to the kitchen . the door of which he found was left ajar ; he opened it . shut and locked it after him .
then the fairy vanished as suddenly as she had appeared , but the astonished [female] did as she had been told . and followed the primroses on the banks until she reached the castle walls . she soon found the door covered with flowers . and moving aside some of the beautiful blossoms , she placed her `` key flower '' upon the lock . slowly the great door opened , but [female] was so surprised at what she saw within that she was afraid to enter .
however this may be , it was certainly an unlucky day for the longs when that kitten came upon their premises . and that they very soon found out , still , people do not always put the saddle upon the right horse immediately . and they did not at first believe that the animal had anything to do with their ill luck . mrs. [female] , however , who had an eye to business . could not stand the constant inroad upon her ducks and chickens .
but now the queen of the peris came into her garden . and she had silver sandals on her feet and a golden saucer in her hand . and she drew water from a diamond fountain . and when she watered the stone youth . life and motion came back to him .
the king 's dog , whose name was shankar . had followed her to see what she did with the box , as soon as she had gone back to the four queens ( who gave her a great many rupees ) . the dog went to the hole in which she had put the box . took the box out , and opened it , when he saw the beautiful little boy . he was very much delighted and said , if it pleases [male] that this child should live .
in a little while came a great bird flying with an island in its claws . and let it fall down on the [female] , and sunk every ship . after it had done that , it flew up to the sandhill and flapped its wings . so that the wind nearly took off the heads of the sailors . and it flew past the fir with such force that it turned the lad right about .
as for the men fathers , when they looked at the clods and the loose earth thus turned over . they found them to be very soft , so the women and girls were able to break them up with their sticks . then the seeds , dropped by the birds that came flying back every spring time . from far-away lands , sprouted , it was noticed that new kinds of plants grew up . which had stalks , in the heads or ears of these were a hundredfold more seeds .
but just then she began to feel the motion of the ship and knew that it was sailing away . and commenced to shriek and cry , but [female] told her all that had happened . and how that he had come only for her , and that his foster brother the king was dying for love of her . and could not come himself because the two countries were at war . so at last the princess became content , and they sailed on and on towards the country of [female] the true .
how glad the wayfarer was to see the light , how pleased he was to see all the evil things of the dark scurrying back into their holes ! he could now find his way , and he made for the edge of the treacherous marsh with such haste that he had not time to wonder at the strange thing that had happened . he did not know that the blessed light that showed him his path to safety shone from the radiant hair of the moon . bound fast to a snag and half buried in the bog . and the moon herself was so glad he was safe .
then followed , in answer to further questions , a long series of reminiscences of the severe discipline imposed on her in earliest childhood by her father . a stern , hard man , as she related them . she seemed to feel again all the emotions that they had provoked . the shame , grief , fear , doubt . longing for sympathy , literally , she lived through them anew .
the luck o the sea be with you . but do not forgetful be of bringing some sweet lan eggs for the children of the sea . she seemed to bear up well for a long time and would often be seen sitting on the rocks in the evening . singing sad songs , and casting longing glances up to the apple tree above . she kept very shy of everyone coming her way .
at this many other of the ephelantoes stamped across the swamp and stood in the mist around him . nod 's hand was in his pocket and pressed against his slim thigh bone . and there , hard and round , he felt as in a dream his wonderstone . and he caught back his fears , and thus , up aloft , twenty feet or more between earth and sky . he twisted his head and said softly : deal with the [male] gently .
`` can i be of any assistance ? '' asked a friendly voice , it came from a little being perched on the desk in front of him . who certainly had not been there a moment before , he was about the size of a two-year-old child . but he had the face of an old man . a genial old man with twinkling eyes , his body was very round and quite filled his suit of blue knitted jersey . and his arms and legs were long and spindling .
so the king 's son left the forest , and wandered over trodden and untrodden paths till he reached a great city . he tried to get work , but he could not find any . besides , he knew no trade by which to make a living . at last he went to the castle and asked if they would employ him . the courtiers did not know what use they could make of him .
when he saw the great wheel standing in the corner . and had guessed the use of it , the merchant heaved a sigh of relief . at any rate , if the weaver could not guess the riddle . he at least might put the minister on the right track . so without more ado he told the story of the circle .
after this [male] took leave of the king . the prince , and all the knights , and set off ; taking with him his cap of knowledge . his sword of sharpness , his shoes of swiftness . and his invisible coat , the better to perform the great exploits that might fall in his way . he went along over high hills and lofty mountains .
the same moment a terrible storm of thunder and lightning . wind and rain , came on , the uproar was appalling . [female] threw herself upon the ground . hid her face in her hands , and there lay until it was over . as soon as she felt the sun shining on her , she rose .
in order to have nothing more to fear for [male] from the wrath of [male] . young and handsome taught him the fairy art . and presented him with the gift of continual youth . having thus provided for his happiness , she next considered his glory . she gave him the castle of flowers .
they both bowed , and although they still seemed somewhat frightened they answered him civilly and in the same words . and closed their doors at the same time , so prince marvel and [male] rode up the double path to the hills . and the two cows became frightened and ran away with the same swinging step , keeping an exact space apart . and when they were a safe distance they both stopped . looked over their right shoulders , and `` mooed '' at the same instant .
callisto , the daughter of [male] . king of arcadia , was a huntress in the train of [male] . devoted to the pleasures of the chase , who had made a vow never to marry . but [female] , under the form of the huntress goddess . succeeded in obtaining her affections , [female] , being extremely jealous of her .
i know that voice , that is the right bride . and no other will i have , and everything that he had forgotten , and that had been swept out of his mind . came suddenly home to him in his heart . and the faithful [female] was married to her dear [female] ; her sorrow came to an end and her joy began . in times gone by there was a king who had at the back of his castle a beautiful pleasure garden .
doctor [female] patient was a ten year old girl . the daughter of a clergyman , she had been lovingly reared . and until the age of nine had been easy to manage , vivacious , and happy . then there came a marked change in her behaviour , she became easily irritated . had frequent crying spells , and frequent fits of sulkiness .
the whole household was thrown into confusion , and day after day mystic rites and incantations were performed by the priests over braziers of [male] . while prayers were recited without ceasing ; but the visions only became more frequent , and there was no sign of their ceasing . after the 5th year of shoho , the style of the years was changed to keian . and during the 1st year of keian the spirits continued to haunt the palace . and now they appeared in the chamber of [male] no suké 's eldest son .
but the stream got stronger and stronger , the tin soldier could already see daylight at the end of the tunnel . but at the same time he heard a roaring sound . which might well have made a bolder man than he tremble , only think ! where the tunnel ended , the water of the kennel was poured down into a great canal . which would be , for him , just as dangerous as for [location] to sail down a great waterfall !
of course he might have locked the things up . and forbidden [male] to touch them , but that might have seemed harsh , and , as you may easily imagine . with all the powers at his command , the king fancied he could easily rescue [male] from any very serious danger at the hands of giants or magicians or monsters . he only wanted to give him a fright or two . and make him respect the judgment of older and wiser people than himself .
`` that will do for today , '' said he , and stretched himself out to go to sleep . as soon as he began to snore , [male] crept out of the oven . went on tiptoe to the table , and , snatching up the little brown hen . made a dash for the door , then the hen began to cackle . and the giant began to wake up ; but before he was quite awake , [male] had escaped from the castle .
concerning cosmology , the igorot believes [female] gave the earth and all things connected with it . [female] makes it rain and storm , gives day and night . heat and cold , the earth is `` just as you see it . '' it ceases somewhere a short distance beyond the most distant place an igorot has visited . he does not know how it is supported , why should it fall ? ', he asks .
the prince laughed as he watched it [male] about from chair to table and back to chair again . he was so occupied with the bird that he did not notice that the walls had again shaken and that the windows were now their full size . until the added light caused him to look around , he turned and saw the room looking almost exactly as it had done on the day he had entered it with so much pride because it was all his own . now it seemed close and stuffy , and he would gladly have given it all for the humblest home in his father 's kingdom where he could meet people and hear them talk . and see them smile at each other , even if they should take no notice of him .
now she walked lightly and quickly , for she was tall and well grown , soon she reached the crest of the first hill . and remembered how she had sat down there and cried , when she was a child . and how the flies had tormented her , they were buzzing and teasing still ; for good times or bad make no difference to them . as long as the sun shines , then she reached the [female] at the top of the next hill . and far below her lay the forest , and deep within it ran yarrow .
to this the rajah , who loved his daughter , gladly consented , and gave them a fine house and grounds . now the weaver , who was not accustomed to good society , or to living with those above his station in life . made a salaam , or obeisance , such as a poor man is wont to do . to his wife every morning , and she began to suspect that he had deceived her . and was not a real rajah , so she asked him one day to tell her the whole truth about himself .
but this did not please dwarf [male] , who for his own purpose had taken the form of an innocent babe . he offered [male] such splendid ransom of sword and shield to set him free . that the emperor laid him down again , and even allowed him to hold the magic ring . by the wearing of which it had been possible for him to see what is usually hidden from mortal sight . now it was [male] 's turn .
the emperor turned his face and gazed searchingly down at the jewels . which floated in bright clear [male] on the waters of the rhine . the emperor bowed his head in courteous farewell . and sailed on his magic boat up the moonlit stream . [male] after him , the [male] in the point of the shield flashed brightly in the moonlight .
the other man was not so tall , yet would have struck nobody as short . but merely as strong and handsome , his hair also was curly , but fair and cropped close to a strong . massive head -- the sort of head you break a door with . as [male] said of the miller 's , his military [male] and the carriage of his shoulders showed him a soldier . but he had a pair of those peculiar [male] and piercing blue eyes which are more common in sailors .
batcha took the bridle but was too terrified to act , the wizard spoke again and [male] made one uncertain step in the dragon 's direction . he lifted his arm to throw the bridle over the dragon 's head . when the dragon suddenly turned on him , swooped under him . and before [male] knew what was happening he found himself on the dragon 's back and he felt himself being lifted up . up , up , above the tops of the forest trees , above the very mountains themselves .
after a time it so happened that another king . having lost his way , passed by with his servants and escort . wondering how he could find his way home . for the forest was very vast , he too heard the music . and told one of his men to find out whence it came .
without waiting for [female] to explain , she snatched the spoon out of her friend 's hand . she filled it with cream from the bowl . and was about to raise it to her lips when the [male] jumped from behind [male] . and settling himself behind [male] 's shoulders . poked forward his head , and again lapped up the cream from out of the spoon .
fortunatus took up the cap , put it on his head . and could not help wishing himself on board the ship that was going back to famagosta . in less than a moment he was carried on board of her . just as she was ready to sail ; and there being a brisk gale , they were out of sight in half an hour . before the sultan had even time to repent of his folly for letting [male] try the cap on his head .
the dryad asked herself if these high grown houses . which stood so close around her , would not remove and take other shapes , like the clouds in the sky . and draw aside , so that she might cast a glance into [location] . and over it , [female] must show itself . the vendome column , and the wondrous building which had called and was still calling so many strangers to the city .
but in this they counted black chicks before they were hatched . for when the princess sank down to the bottom of the cistern . she found herself in a great wide meadow . all covered over with bright flowers , as many as there are stars in the sky at night . across this meadow she went on and on and on ; but never a single soul did she see until at last she came to a great .
so they remained quietly in the palace the rest of that day . and no one molested them in the least , in the evening the girl played and sang for them . and the ancient pair of [female] danced a double shuffle for their amusement that nearly convulsed them with laughter . for one danced exactly like the other , and the old men 's legs were still very [male] . although their wrinkled faces remained anxiously grave throughout their antics , [male] also sang a song about the king of thieves whom prince marvel had conquered .
the memorable climax of the story is the suicide of [female] . but [female] lets the dark side die with the great financier . there are a few marriages , and the share prices of the south central pacific and mexican railway begin to rise again as fisker gets back to work on selling shares in [location] . what went up came down ; and it came back up a little , we follow the fates of a large cast of characters . perhaps we do not see that much into the soul of [male] .
so [male] and [male] became king and queen of the people of the plain and lived happily ever after . a black ship in the background , persuded by another ship in the foreground . once upon a time , in a country of mountains which bordered upon the sea . dwelt a rich merchant who had three sons , the eldest and the second born were his joy . for they were merchants too , and remained at his side .
`` nothing less than `` blaisean '' , '' replied the fox , throwing himself down in his corner . and if the wolf could have seen him in the darkness he would have noticed that he was laughing to himself . some days afterwards the same thing happened , the fox was asked to another christening . this time at a place some twenty five miles along the shore . and as he had grumbled before , so he grumbled again ; but he declared that it was his duty to go .
2 , his royal highness is to have everything he cries for . else he will grow peevish and discontented , 3 , he is to be allowed to eat and drink when . what , and as much he pleases ; hunger being a call of nature . and whatever nature dictates is natural , 4 , his royal highness is to be dissuaded from speaking to any one below the rank of baron . as it is highly desirable that he should acquire a proper pride .
as he stopped speaking a flash of lightning lit up the sky . and the sullen roar of distant thunder followed , from every church in the land the passing bell tolled forth and the solemn sounds came swelling on the breeze . again came the flash of lightning , and again the thunder . and now the splash of falling rain accompanied and almost drowned the thunder . the sun 's rim was now almost down , for the last time the old king kissed his daughter .
immediately he grasped the sword by the handle . but could not stir it , when king [male] heard this he was sorry . and then he bade sir [male] try it . who said that he would gladly , to bear sir [male] company . thereupon he took hold of the sword and drew it strongly .
he could not tell what had waked him , but could he be awake . or was he not dreaming ? the curtain of the king 's door . a dull red ever before , was glowing a gorgeous , a radiant purple ; and the crown wrought upon it in silks and gems was flashing as if it burned ! what could it mean ? was the king 's chamber on fire ? he darted to the door and lifted the curtain .
presently [male] went out to make a trial of his strength . and going into the kitchen garden , he seized a pole and stuck it half its length into the ground . and turned it with such strength that the whole village turned round . then he went back into the cottage to take leave of his parents and ask their blessing . the old folk fell to weeping bitterly when he spoke of leaving them .
this warning was so shocking to poor [male] , that he was ready to go mad . he ran to the window , and saw the two giants coming along arm in arm . this window was right over the gates of the castle . now there were two strong cords in the room , [male] made a large noose with a slip knot at the ends of both these . and as the giants were coming through the iron gates .
the cliffs of moher , now among the sites being considered for an upcoming list of the seven wonders of the world . have become the most visited tourist attraction in [male] . however , there were only a few other visitors when our own little family of five . mist swirling in our faces , paid our respects in 1974 . these sheer precipices , facing the atlantic from the western coast of [male] .
they all came except the little weeny fellow who dropped the [female] . and of course everyone said that it was fear that kept him away . and that he must be guilty , the heralds were at once sent in search of him . and after a while they found him hiding in a cluster of ferns . and brought him before the king , the poor little fellow was so frightened that at first he could scarcely speak a word .
he inhabited a beautiful palace at the bottom of the sea at agea in euboea . and also possessed a royal residence on mount olympus . which , however , he only visited when his presence was required at the council of the gods . but although [male] ruled with absolute power over the ocean and its inhabitants . he nevertheless bowed submissively to the will of the great ruler of olympus .
his father made him more arrows . and when he was again left alone , he shot one of them out . but although he looked as sharply as he could toward the spot where it fell . and ran thither at once , he could not find it , he shot another . which was lost in the same way , returning to the lodge to replenish his quiver .
to be sure , this does not mean that all these children are intellectually deficient . for the term `` retarded '' is by no means synonymous with `` dullards . '' irregular attendance owing to illness or truancy accounts for not a little retardation . the education of a good many children is deliberately postponed by their parents . and as a result they are necessarily behind grade for some time after they enter school .
the sheep is a very useful animal , its wool . sheared off , makes [location] cloth and flannel . and all kinds of woollen goods ; and its flesh . called mutton , is a chief part of our food . when sheep are little they are called lambs .
but alas , she soon remembered the terrors of the night . and when , in answer to her questioning look , [female] told her . with faltering voice , his fears for [male] . the [male] 's grief found vent in bitter weeping . [female] , with the happy buoyancy of youth .
so the man went back , and as he came to the palace he saw it was very much larger . and had great towers and splendid gateways ; the herald stood before the door . and a number of soldiers with kettle drums and trumpets . and when he came inside everything was of marble and gold . and there were many curtains with great golden tassels , then he went through the doors of the saloon to where the great throne room was .
he was overjoyed to see her , and longed to get to the top of the mountain . but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again . when he saw that it was impossible to reach her . he was greatly grieved , and said to himself , `` i will remain here and wait for her , '' so he built himself a little hut .
the road emerging from wooded valleys turned abruptly to the right along the summit of perpendicular cliffs some two or three hundred feet in height . at their base , the blue main , hitherto unknown to the forest bred [female] . broke in tiny ripples on the silver sands , it was a tideless expanse of sea . and therefore no unsightly marks of ebbing waters strewed the beach . only a long bright undulating line showed where the unstable element found its limits and mother earth claimed her own .
`` i have a plan , '' replied the wicked king . and what his plan was you will soon discover , from the limb of a tree above his head swayed a huge python . one of those reptiles that are able to crush a man 's bones in their coils . a few yards away crouched a savage panther . its glaring red eyes fixed full on the [male] .
all these questions were showered upon him without reply . [male] respectfully kissed his father 's hand . hastened to his sisters chamber , took two of their finest dresses . went to the stable , saddled a [male] , mounted a beautiful spanish jennet , and was about to quit the castle . when he found his relatives , friends , squires .
offero obeyed , and lo , out of the bare palm staff sprang leaves and dates . then [male] knew that it was [male] whom he had borne . and he fell at his feet , thus it was that [male] came by his name . because he was true to his name we always call him st [male] . once there was a poor farmer who had three sons -- [male] , [male] , and [male] .
when they set out they came very soon to a high road that led to the gates of the tsar 's city . now it was the daily practice of the tsar to walk in the ways of the city for an hour after sunrise . and bewail the death of those of his people who had perished by the hands of the giants . and also to pray fervently that his own daughter would never so perish , so it was that on this same morning he came . by his wanderings through empty streets , to the part of the wall where the tall tree ladder was standing .
but now came fresh trouble , the princess did not want to be rescued , and the prince had no token with him by which she might have recognized him as her brother . in vain the poor boy told her that if she did not come willingly . he would carry her off by force ; she kept her hand on the dangerous nail and it was impossible to coax her . i must mention that it would go hard with them if they waited for the dragon . for there were only two champions , and if one held up the palace by keeping the gates on their hinges and the other waited for the dragon in the middle of the court yard .
a very characteristic article of seventeenth century dutch furniture is the large and massive wardrobe . with the doors handsomely carved , not infrequently having three columns , one in the centre and one at each side . and these generally form part of the doors , which are also enriched with square panels . carved in the centre and finished with mouldings , there are specimens in the south kensington museum . of these and also of earlier flemish work when the renaissance was purer in style and .
instead thereof came the crafty servant of sir [male] . throwing himself at the feet of the king . the king looked at the face of the messenger long and sadly . the pain which the king suffered would have softened any ordinary heart . but the murderer was a hard and callous wretch , and his brazen eyes outlooked the king .
in like fashion , we tell of a man so tall that he had to go up on a [male] to shave himself . and down cellar to put his boots on , we americans are good natured . as is necessary for humor , and we have brains . as is necessary for wit , and we have the vitality that makes creation easy , even inevitable . so there is never any dearth among [location] of the spirit of laughter .
he walked straight in , and remained there some time , i concealed myself near the door . and saw [male] come forth again , escorted by my father . who respectfully shook his hand , and with many bows parted with him at the door . my mind was uneasy , and i remained some time in my concealment . at length , however , hunger , which i feared more than blows .
`` not in this king 's hall , '' said the hunchbacked porter . he would have barred the door to [male] . but the voice of the king called him away . [male] then strode into the hall and saw the king at table with his friends . all dark bearded , and cruel looking men , and when [male] looked on them he knew that the boy whom he had trained in nobility had become a king over robbers .
meanwhile the two robbers proposed to [female] to carry off what they could find . but he forbade them , saying : it shall never be told of [male] . that he enters houses by night . to steal gold , [male] , and those he had preserved . quickly stepped into the aqueduct , whither [male] promised to follow them immediately .
and this is a representation of human nature , we are like the goblin . we all go to visit the huckster `` because of the jam . '' and when she really had the little child in her arms . and held it up to its father , then it was like one of the angels in the church to behold . with hair like gold -- the gleam of the setting sun was upon it .
my lord , i also , in my anxiety to find you . wandered about like the others , late one evening i came to a wood . a few miles from the city of kalinga . and very near a public cemetery , seeing no dwelling near , i made myself a bed of leaves . and lay down under a large tree , where i was soon asleep , about midnight .
the next morning the two travellers who had been so long away came back to the land . [male] came first and great clouds of dust foretold his coming . and the sea dashed high against the rocks , and the trees shrieked and tossed their heads . all dancing gaily because of his return , when [male] had passed by , rain came along following close . because of his blindness , for several days rain stayed with the people and the flowers bloomed and the grass was green again and the wells and streams were no longer dry .
the journey had not been in vain , there , on a mossy bank among the beautiful flowers in the garden . he found the princess asleep . and , as he looked down at her , he saw that her face was the face he had seen in the portrait . he tried to wake her , but her sleep was sound . she did not stir , he breathed on her eyelids and whispered in her ear .
his eyes were of no use to him here . for he could not have stared ten wild boars in the face at once . so he kept on playing , and the wild boars danced very slowly . as if in a minuet , then by degrees he played faster and faster till they could hardly twist and turn quickly enough . and ended by all falling over each other in a heap , quite exhausted and out of breath .
the dwarfs , or little hill or earth men of switzerland . are described as of a lively , joyous disposition , fond of strolling through the valleys . and viewing and partaking in the labours of agriculture , kind and generous . they are represented as driving home stray lambs . and leaving brushwood and berries in the way of poor children .
sunshine waited to hear no more , smiling his thanks , he hastened away to put his dear crystal 's love to the test . she had never yet ventured outside the covered gardens of her palace . would she go with him now , and approach the great dragon . and soothe its savage watchfulness into the necessary repose ? as he made the request , there stole into the princess 's cheeks the first faint tinge of colour that had ever been seen there .
nor did i find this at all difficult , the child was so ready to trust . upon one subject alone was he reticent -- the story of his relations with north wind . i fancy he could not quite make up his mind what to think of them . at all events it was some little time before he trusted me with this . only then he told me everything .
but while they were marvelling at this , they heard the reply which time had given . and saw at once that the horn , as the symbol of plenty . was the column of wealth of which time had spoken . then embracing their sister with great joy , they all set out on the same road by which [female] had come . and when they came to the oak tree , and told it what [female] had heard from time .
rhoda would sail little twigs in the stream . her boats were small , but they sometimes went farther than [male] 's . his were loaded so heavily that they often overturned , one day the children were sailing boats when a thunder storm arose . how fast the rain fell , and how fast they ran to the house ! `` poor grandmother will be all wet , '' said [female] .
the prince finding himself , all of a sudden , taken with an extraordinary fit . his eye sight failed , and he , fell down at the foot of his throne in great convulsions . at these words [male] , perceiving day . gave the sultan notice of it , and forbore speaking , ah ! dear sister , says [male] , how grieved am i that you have not time to finish this story !
when the woman heard that she was sore afraid , and immediately shut all the doors and windows of the house . stopped up all the chinks and holes , and kept [female] hidden away . that the sunball should not come and take her away , but she forgot to close up the keyhole . and through it the sunball sent a [female] into the house . which took hold of the little girl and carried her away to him .
humbly penitent , careful and [female] supported their grandfather as they led him to the ledge . but when they had walked a little while they saw that they had gone astray . and had never been that way before , they told their grandfather . but he just bade them keep on in that path . so they came to a steep slope , and the road led up the slope right to the crest of the mountain .
so he bade his wife leave the house . and before his parents knew anything about it . she was gone , his parents scolded him and told him to go at once and bring her back . but he was filled with rage , and would not give in to them . that same night he and his mother fell sick .
but when he looked again there was the goblin as spry as ever . and two more horns had sprouted where the stone had hit him ! `` well , evidently stones won '' t drive him off , ', said [male] . so he went round the goblin and forward on his way . but the imp scuttled on in front of him .
his feeding was on other men 's cattle . which often became his prey , for whenever he wanted food . he would wade over to the mainland , where he would well furnish himself with whatever he could find . for the people at his approach would all forsake their habitations . then would he seize upon their cows and oxen .
that night he had a very curious dream which i think my readers would like to have told them . they would , at least , if they are as fond of nice dreams as i am . and do not have enough of them of their own , he woke . not out of his dream , but into it , thinking he heard a child 's voice . calling `` diamond , diamond , '' he jumped up .
according to this advice , they thoroughly greased the hinge in the tree with the butter . and then set themselves to work to haul up the trunk , this , however , was much more difficult than letting it down . and they had to lift up the head of it . and prop it up on poles . before they could pull upon it with advantage .
the boasting tailor climbed the tree . and perched himself on a bough , and then , holding his breath . he made himself heavy enough thereby , to bend the tree down . soon , however , he had to take breath again , and immediately , having been [male] enough to come without his goose in his pocket . the bough flew up , and to the great joy of the giant .
the goblins , as [male] had discovered , were mining on -- at work both day and night . in divisions , urging the scheme after which he lay in wait . in the course of their tunneling , they had broken into the channel of a small stream . but the break being in the top of it . no water had escaped to interfere with their work , some of the creatures .
first , they requested that peace be made with the crabs . and thus they induced the king of the monkeys to enter their hole unattended . and seated him on the hearth , the monkey . not suspecting any plot , took the hibashi , or [male] . to stir up the slumbering fire , when bang !
[male] lay there listening in silence . his mother sat with a happy smile on her loved face . and by her side [male] 's old teacher . on whose lips he and his wild companions hung in rapt attention . as he told them of the strange lands which he had visited in his youth .
now the chase came by the fresh track to the forest , they saw the riders and ran after them . the forest reached as far as king [male] 's underground kingdom . the chase was flying and the horse with the two riders was always before them . now they almost reached them , now they only had to grasp them . but no , the steed was again far behind them , and see , there they were again before the entrance to king [male] 's kingdom at the same place where they started their chase .
the little girl put her arms round his neck . he blinked his eye ; there was nothing to be seen . `` i believe it is gone , '' he said ; but it was not gone . it was one of those very grains of glass from the mirror . the magic mirror , you remember that horrid mirror .
the princess [female] gave her consent . the falcon married her and bore her away into his own realm , days follow days . hours chase hours ; a whole year goes by . one day prince [male] and his two sisters went out to stroll in the garden green . again there arose a stormcloud with [male] and lightning .
the swallows flew with him a little way . singing , we and you . you and we , the way led across the rushing lutschine . which falls in numerous streams from the dark clefts of the grindelwald glaciers . trunks of fallen trees and blocks of stone form bridges over these streams .
the dump hole the crow liked best , but the canary could never understand the pleasure of digging in such places . in fact , it was hard to blame the crow . she alone ate in one day food enough for twenty canaries . the crow had only one care -- food . perched on some roof . she was always on the lookout for food .
among the fishes which repaired every night to the vicinity of the little hillock . which was the chosen resting place of the ugly songstress , was the great chief of the trouts . a tribe of fish inhabiting the river near by , the chief was of a far greater size than the people of his nation usually are . being as long as a man and quite as broad , of all the creatures which came to listen to the singing of awashanks none appeared to enjoy it so highly as the chief of the trouts . as his bulk prevented him from approaching so near as he wished .
petru now told his hostess what he meant to do . and [male] was still more delighted , they did not talk much more , why should they ? it was already long past midnight , [male] said `` good night , '' thrust the flute into its case , and went up to the garret to get some sleep . when morning dawned , the hero was already awake and the morning star had hardly risen in the sky ere he was up .
mrs. [female] had finished with the girl and saw him just standing at her desk . [female] was not sure just what to say , so he held up the pencil instead . do you need some help with the pencil sharpener ? ', she asked . several children in the front of the class started snickering . `` all right , get back to your work , '' she said to them as she came over to help him .
of course somebody was forgotten , now it does not generally matter if somebody is forgotten . only you must mind who , unfortunately , the king forgot without intending to forget . and so the chance fell upon the princess makemnoit . which was awkward , for the princess was the king 's own sister . and he ought not to have forgotten her , but she had made herself so disagreeable to the old king .
diamond lay awake for a few minutes . thinking what he could do to catch worms , it was very little trouble to make up his mind . however , and still less to go to sleep after it , he got up in the morning as soon as he heard the men moving in the yard . he tucked in his little brother so that he could not tumble out of bed . and then went out , leaving the door open , so that if he should cry his mother might hear him at once .
the peasant regretted the loss of his daughter bitterly . for although so simple she was still his child , the wicked sisters also shed tears . her father put the little silver plate and the little apple into a box . and locked them up , next morning a shepherd was tending his sheep near the place . playing on his pipe , and searching in the forest for one of his flock that was missing .
but [male] , unflinching , kept his firm hold of the chain . next did he become a [male] , tawny and velvet black . and fierce to devour , and still [male] held the chain . and never let his eye fall before the glare of the beast that sought to devour him . a scaly dragon came next , breathing out flames , and yet [male] held him .
noureddin and the beautiful persian , finding the wine excellent . drank of it freely , and while drinking they sang . both had fine voices , and [male] listened to them with great pleasure . first from a distance , then he drew nearer , and finally put his head in at the door . [male] , seeing him , called to him to come in and keep them company .
he assured her his last words were . that it was to him the most afflicting circumstance that he must die so far distant from his dear mother . and that the only thing he wished was , that she would have his corpse transported to bagdad . accordingly early next morning the princess set out with her women and great part of her slaves . to bring her son 's body to her own palace .
on leaving the temple the invisible prince saw six paths lying before him . each of which led through the wood , he was hesitating which to choose , when he suddenly beheld two people coming towards him . down the track which lay most to his right , they turned out to be the prince gnome and his friend . and the sudden desire to get some news of his sister . princess [female] , caused the invisible prince to follow them and to listen to their conversation .
the man who was going to be hanged jumped into the dragon fly ship and flew whonging away before anybody could stop him . young leather and red slippers were walking out of the town laughing and singing again . `` deep down among the dagger dancers . '' the man with a sorry face , not so sorry now any more , came running after them . behind the man and running after him were five long legged spider jack rabbits .
`` you must do the same then , '' said [female] , `` for you are prettier than i , '' and then the princesses looked over the edge of the tank at their reflections in the water . both were lovely , but [female] was a little taller than her sister and a little more graceful . both had beautiful complexions , with teeth like pearls and eyes that shone like stars . one day while [male] was in the jungle talking to their friend the jackal .
he was good in a feudal way , i gathered a severely feudal way to his retainers . he threw pots but seldom . his eldest child he seemed to worship in some sort of pagan fashion of his own . the boy might have sat for a child dionysos with his leopard skin . and his arm of golden copper thrown about his father 's pot of beer .
true , their faults increased equally : the one became uglier , and the other more stupid . day by day , unlucky fair one , she never had a word to say for herself . or else it was the silliest word imaginable . and she was so awkward that she could not place four teacups in a row without breaking at least one of them . nor drink a glass of water without spilling half of it over her clothes .
sir , replied one of the domestics , will you listen to a robber . who enters people 's houses to plunder and murder them ? if you will not believe us , only look upon his back . upon which they showed it to the judge . who , without any other information , immediately commanded one hundred lashes to be given him with a bull 's pizzle over his shoulders .
the next morning the geese were awake at daybreak . long before sunrise , now the boy felt sure that he would have to go home . but , curiously enough , both he and the white [male] were permitted to follow the wild ones on their morning tour . the boy could not comprehend the reason for the delay . but he figured it out in this way .
it was a terrible night , and in the morning , only think ! nearly all the shields had changed places , in some places the inscriptions were so malicious . that grandfather would not speak of them at all ; but i saw that he was chuckling secretly . and there may have been some inaccuracy in his description , after all , the poor people in the town . and still more the strangers , were continually making mistakes in the people they wanted to see .
great joy was in the forest , and proud were the parents of their family . and still more of the little one who had come to them ; while all the neighbors flocked in . to see [female] brown breast 's little child . and the tiny [female] talked to them , and sang so merrily , that they could have listened for ever . soon she was the joy of the whole forest .
by these canons the judges and other officers of state were made responsible . the benefices which had been withdrawn from the leudes were restored , the king was forbidden from granting written orders for carrying off rich widows . young virgins , and nuns ; and the penalty of death was ordered to be enforced against those who disobeyed the canons of the council . thence sprung two new species of legislation . one ecclesiastical , the other civil , between which royalty , more and more curtailed of its authority .
with lightened hearts [female] and [female] gave the promise . then the majestic lady bowed her silvery head in [female] farewell . and passed out through the door , it was christmas [female] . [female] had cleaned and tidied the room with even more than her ordinary care . the boards were [female] , and [female] strewed them with finely cloven fir twigs .
i defy you now , [person] , to prove that your grassblade is greener than mine . the girls now turned their attention to their neglected apples . varying this more serious business with comments on the story that had just been related . [person] : i should be glad to know , [person] , what you make of this matter . [person] : indeed , [person] , it is difficult to make anything at all of matter so bewildering .
on all such occasions interviews are bad , the teller of this story ventures to take the opportunity of recommending parents in such cases always to refuse interviews . not only between the young lady and the lover who is to be excluded , but also between themselves and the lover . the vacillating tone -- even when the resolve to suppress vacillation has been most determined . is perceived and understood , the story is built with several materials familiar to [female] readers . the faithful young woman who can never love another , whatever becomes of the love of her life .
he therefore determined that he would not be caught by any such tricks as these . and that he would be on his guard if the sphinx spoke to him . the creature was lying down when the king first saw it . but when he approached nearer it rose to its feet . there was nothing savage about its look .
we went down the tigris , and landed before the [person] 's palace . and i then had time to consider with myself , and to find out my mistake . when we came out of the boat , we were surrounded by a new troop of the judge of the police 's guard . who tied [location] all , and carried [location] before the [person] . i suffered myself to be tied as well as the rest .
the uhlans flashed away , and a man could scarcely have counted ten before [male] had the table . then he opened the pack and commanded : `` three hundred uhlans this way ! '' and the uhlans vanished in the pack , [male] was beside himself with gladness when he took the table . the pack , and the bag , and continued his way . in the evening he came to the capital town .
he lost no time in starting out in [male] of the apples of youth and the water of life . and do you know , he has not come back yet , as for the king . well , i fear he 's still ferrying that boat across the black sea ! there was once a land that was dreary and dark as the grave , for the sun of heaven never shone upon it . the king of the country had a wonderful horse that had .
looking at the white hand , what was his surprise to see upon the middle finger the ring he had given to the [male] he loved . then he looked into her face and recognized her . and in a flash he understood that she had come to court as a huntsman . only to be near him , the king was so touched that he kissed her white cheeks till they grew rosy . and her blue eyes opened in wonder , `` you shall be my queen , ''
probably she heard him call her name more than three times . doubtless , afterward she fancied that she remembered how his voice had sounded in beseeching . tender , at last even imperious tones through the empty corridors . but she did not turn , and hurried into her room , when , on the evening of the christening day . [male] accompanied his aunt home .
some night that happens once in every seven years , while the [female] is riding round the curragh . the entrance may be seen by any one chancing to pass by , about a hundred years ago . a horse dealer that was late abroad and a little drunk , saw the lighted cavern . and went in , the lights , and the stillness , and the sight of the men in armour . cowed him a good deal , and he became sober .
constable , shall not , ma'am , if you valooed your child . you would be right glad to have her go . she 's got bad notions enough , we will edicate her now , second fairy . look at that squirrel , lively and shy ; i know he can tell . by the fun in his eye , third fairy .
when the play at the little theater began , the rest sat and looked on . they were requested to applaud and stamp , or crack , whenever they felt gratified with what they saw . the riding whip said he never cracked for old people . only for the young -- those who were not yet married , `` i crack for everybody , '' said the [male] , it was not worth much , but it was very well played .
`` oh , i forgot , '' said the princess , and was silent , so the water grew and grew . and rose up and up on the prince , and the princess sat and looked at him . she fed him now and then , the night wore on . the waters rose and rose , the moon rose likewise higher and higher . and shone full on the face of the dying prince , the water was up to his neck .
but , wig and all , [female] had a high position in [female] manor . the household was conducted on strictly feudal principles , nobody , except the members of the family . received higher consideration than did the old governess , she and the chaplain were on a level . socially , and they sat at the same table with the baron . that drew the line , old [male] the butler might tell little [male] as often as he pleased that he was just as good as [male] .
he listened to no advice about laying aside his fancy . but rode up to the gate and on into the heart of the city . the place was so splendid that the eyes of the ages have never seen its like . and there , in an open square , he found a tent of [female] satin set up . and beneath it two jewelled drums with jewelled sticks .
but [male] with the pitying heart came to his relief . she exiled herself from [female] . and endured the darkness and the cold of the cavern . that she might take some of the torment away from him who was her husband . [female] stood , holding in her hands a cup into which fell the serpent 's venom .
and the curious thing about this carbuncle was , that it was said that it could be seen at certain times . if only the people who were looking for it were at the right spot at the right moment . now [male] had made up his mind that he would find this wonderful stone . so , while he pretended to spend all his time in reading his great book or distilling medicines from his herbs . he was really keeping a keen look out during his wanderings .
on the floor stood two large crystal boxes opposite each other , and these attracted his curiosity at once . stepping up to one of them , he saw within it what looked like a model in miniature of a fine castle surrounded by farms . barns , stables , and a number of other buildings . everything was quite tiny , but so beautifully and carefully finished that it might have been the work of an accomplished artist . he would have continued gazing much longer at this remarkable curiosity had not the voice desired him to turn round and look at the crystal coffin which stood opposite .
and white [female] , full of joy , took black [female] in her little arms . and so they went back , and it was well they did . for there were five little rats in that sack of flour . and all those five were killed when the mill fell down , then they heard a rat-a-tat . and the voice of their mother calling : here , black [female] !
there with a bedrock of austere [male] we slept in peace . at glimmer of dawn we were saddling up . we rode to another kraal , but the folk there had no news for us . we were close on the hills now at last , we came to a low river at the foot of them . we chose a landlocked pool that seemed to be immune from crocodiles .
now as [female] was riding one day , he alighted off his horse to see that sport . for they were playing for a wager , [male] was a stranger . and none did know him there , but [male] spoiled their sport . for he , meeting the football , took it such a kick . that they never found their ball more , they could see it fly .
a hut of solid ice presented itself . long pendants of ice hung from the ceiling . snow in masses was being formed into shapes of statue like [female] by a company of little furry objects whose noses were not even visible . and others were tracing out , on a broad screen of lace like texture . patterns of every star and leaf and flower imaginable .
the queen , convinced that her daughter in law required nothing further . offered only her portrait , as a token of esteem and friendship . rose received it with grateful respect , then ascended the fairy 's car . and was in a few minutes surrounded by the foresters , who never wearied of caressing her . poor [female] drew back , [female] , not knowing whether to hope or fear ; but [female] .
then she went back ; and from that hour the king 's son could not remain at home . but planned to go for the world sweetly speaking bird , therefore , parting with his sister amidst bitter tear shedding . he started through the kingdom and the world to bring home the sweetly speaking bird . but he enjoined on his sister that if the third day he were not at home . she should set out to seek him over a certain road .
we were poor people , but living was cheap . and we had plenty comfort , in those days house rent did not cost more than half a rupee a month . and you could build a very comfortable house for a hundred rupees . not such good houses as people now live in , but well enough for people like us . then a whole family could live as comfortably on six or seven rupees a month as they can now on thirty .
of these , thirty eight are [person] proper , i.e. , tales with definite plot and evolution . ten are sagas or legends locating romantic stories in definite localities ; no less than nineteen are drolls or comic anecdotes . four are cumulative stories : six beast tales . while ten are merely ingenious nonsense tales put together in such a form as to amuse children . the preponderance of the comic element is marked , and it is clear that humour is a characteristic of the english folk .
a fortnight after the old woman had paid her visit . the king came home , having conquered his enemies , at this proof that the old woman had spoken truth . the queen 's heart bounded , for she now had fresh hopes that the rest of the prophecy might be fulfilled . she cherished the basket and the egg as her chiefest treasures . and had a golden case made for the basket , so that when the time came to lay the egg in it .
often , too , might they have been seen watching the ships as they sailed up and down the channel . [male] , loved the sea and its pebbly shore . he was never so happy as when , with his beloved myfanwy , he was watching the tidal eddies . or viewing the frail barques as they rode so majestically o er the briny waves , carrying in their laps .
so she flew on till she met two travelers trudging along . one behind the other , they were both foot sore and weary , and the first carried his bundle on a stick over his shoulder . while the second had his shoes in his hand , lightly as a feather the partridge settled on the first traveler 's stick . he , none the wiser , trudged on , but the second traveler . seeing the bird sitting so tamely just in front of his nose .
the couple had one boy called [male] . a handsome , pleasant faced boy of twelve , and tall for his age . he used to sit by his mother in the market and would carry home what people bought from her . for which they often gave him a pretty flower . or a slice of cake , or even some small coin .
wayfarers indeed were few in that solitary island , which was for the most part covered with thick beech woods . and had for its inhabitants only the wild creatures of wood and water and the strange unearthly shapes that none but the poet 's eyes could see . the nearest village was miles away on the mainland . and for months at a time the solitude would be undisturbed by sound of human voice or footstep . which was the poet 's idea of happiness .
to this there was no answer , only another shout -- go home . [female] jarvis -- go home . fair play is a jewel ; but shut your eyes . or ye will never see the light of day again . [male] shut his eyes , knowing now that was the way to see clearly .
[male] , throwing off his disguise , clasped his sister in his arms . and warm tears of human happiness rushed from [female] 's eyes . trampling under foot the crown of violets . and keeping firm hold of her mother 's cross . she begged [female] to bear her back to their own world without delay .
charmed with these words , and still more by the tone in which they were uttered . the prince assured her that he loved her more than his life . for a long time did they sit talking , and yet had not said half enough . their only interruption was the little dog [male] . who had awakened with his [female] , and now began to be jealous that the princess did not notice him as much as she was wont to do .
`` but of what use are they ? '' said the incorrigible mother who . you see , was not yet quite cured , meanwhile the story was noised abroad that [female] had found a treasure in the forest . the very next day , christmas day . as they were eating their goose , stuffed with apples . there was a ring at the bell -- in walked a very [female] prussian policeman with fierce moustaches .
when i had all things completed , i presented them to the king . and put them upon one of his horses , his majesty mounted immediately . and was so pleased with them , that he testified his satisfaction by large presents to me . i could not avoid making several others for his ministers and the principal officers of his household . who all of them made me presents that enriched me in a little time .
then they returned and told [male] , who , summoning his warriors attacked the castle . [male] and eidoel talk with the eagle of gwern abwy . and whilst the fight was going on , [male] and [male] . mounting on the shoulders of the fish , broke into the dungeon . and brought away with them [male] , the son of modron .
in the midst of his fright he was surprised by a [male] . a heavy rain poured down in streams , and a storm wind arose which rooted up the tallest trees . everything glimmered before his eyes and his ears were deafened . but he held his sword in his hand . and stood as firm as a rock , suddenly in the midst of black smoke and flashes of lightning .
there was once an old man whose wife was exceedingly quarrelsome , the old man had no rest from her day or night . she nagged and nagged at him at every little trifle . but if the old man ventured to gainsay her in anything , she immediately caught up a broomstick . or something else , and chased him out of the kitchen . the old man had only one consolation ; he would leave his old woman and go into the fields to set snares and bird traps .
everybody found her as charming and good as the prince and they felt disposed to love her as they loved him . [male] and [male] were very happy and loved each other tenderly always , [female] never knew the terrible punishment of her father . mother and sisters , when she asked [female] the fate of her sisters . he told her that their faces were much disfigured by their fall amongst the stones but they were well and married and the good fairy expressly forbade [female] to think of them . she spoke of them no more , as to [male] and [male] .
`` now , then , you shall see master gold coat fly , '' said the old man , and let the sparrow go , who , in deadly fright . flew off , illumined by the beaming sun , how she shone ! all the sparrows , even a crow , although an old fellow . were much frightened at the sight ; they , however flew on after him .
the two queens grew desperate when they found so much virtue in the two princes . and , instead of reforming themselves , renounced all sentiments of mothers and of nature . and conspired together to destroy them : they made their women believe the two princes had attempted to ravish them . they counterfeited the matter to the life by tears . cries , and curses , and lay in the same bed .
by degrees he perceived that the hut afforded little or no shelter from the cold night air . and as the energy of the fire subsided he lifted from the floor a piece of wood . broke it over his knee , and laid the fragments upon the red–hot embers . whether this operation was regarded by his strange neighbour as a species of insult we can not say . but the demon seized , as if in bitter mockery , one of the gate–posts .
we see the youth with a golden fillet around his brow . we see him at the thing . we see him in battle and in play . where the best is he that can cut off the other 's eyebrows without scratching the skin . or causing a wink with the eyes , on pain of losing his station .
when [male] came back and asked for more work , the king was at a loss . for he had felt sure that now he was rid of him . so he knew of nothing better to do than to send him to the devil 's place . `` now you can go to the devil , and fetch the tribute from him , '' said the king , [male] went off with his knapsack on his back .
so they went away more mystified than ever , and , as the following nights brought no moon . they could do nothing but stand about in groups in the streets discussing the strange thing . the disappearance of the moon was the one topic . by the fireside , at the work bench , in the inn and all about , their tongues went nineteen to the dozen . and no wonder , for who had ever heard of the moon being lost , stolen or strayed ?
the next morning she again stole out to see him . he was alive but very weak ; he could only open his eyes for a moment to look at tiny . who stood by holding a piece of decayed wood in her hand . for she had no other lantern , thank you . pretty little [male] , '' said the sick swallow ; `` i have been so nicely warmed .
just then a sound attracted the attention of both the boy and the beast . it was a deer , before the lion could recover from its surprise . [male] had sprung on to the back of the deer which started to run at lightning speed . [male] tightly to its back , behind him a fierce roar indicated that the lion was in pursuit . across the desolate plain and through the forest the chase continued .
the flower family lived in a little house in a broad grassy meadow . which sloped a few rods from their front door down to a [person] , silvery river . right across the river rose a lovely dark green mountain . and when there was a rainbow , as there frequently was , nothing could have looked more enchanting than it did rising from the opposite bank of the stream with the wet . shadowy mountain for a background .
`` the [male] who can work such wonders is fitted to be the wife of the greatest chief , '' he said , and so he married her . and took her with him across the sea to his own home . where they lived happy for ever after , there was once a fisherman who was called [male] . and his [male] name was [male] .
today he seemed to see her again , as he had seen her first at the castle of fontainebleau . when he was but fifteen years of age . and she still younger , they had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the papal nuncio in the presence of the french king and all the court . and he had returned to the escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow hair . and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand as he stepped into his carriage .
and what a pleasure that seemed , to the dog of course . but scarcely less so to the boy , how he skimmed along over the ground . his cheeks glowing , and his hair flying . and his legs -- oh , what a pair of legs he had ! prince dolor watched him with great intentness .
oh , what salt tears she wept , and she did not dare to tell her sorrow to any one . the window stood open all day , and the little elf could easily go out into the garden . to the roses and all the other flowers ; but for all that , he resolved not to leave the sorrowful [male] . in the window there stood a monthly rose , and he placed himself in one of its flowers . and there could be near the poor young lady who was so unhappy , her brother came often into her room .
it must be stated , however , that in the later days of [location] . a system approximating to our own currency was adopted , and the triple mountain visible from the great southern capital was the favourite representation on the state coinage . it was with the increase of population and civilization in the early toltec times that land first became worth fighting for . it is not proposed to trace the system or want of system prevalent in the troublous times anterior to the advent of the golden age . but the records of that epoch present to the consideration .
at the beginning of the seventh year of the existence of the feud it happened that a daughter in law of [female] 's was present at a marriage . at the wedding feast she openly accused [female] of stealing a horse . [female] was intoxicated at the time and was in no mood to stand the insult . so in retaliation he struck the woman a terrific blow . which confined her to her bed for more than a week .
then they harnessed the calf to see if the coach would move . and away it went , over rough and smooth , over stock and stone . so that they could scarcely breathe , and sometimes they were on the ground . and sometimes up in the air ; and when they came to the church the coach began to go round and round like a spinning wheel . and it was with the utmost difficulty and danger that they were able to get out of the coach and into the church .
one coat was already finished and she had begun the second , when she heard a huntsman 's horn and was struck with fear . as the sound came nearer and nearer , she also heard dogs barking . and fled with terror into the cave , she hastily bound together the nettles she had gathered . and sat upon them , in a moment there came bounding toward her out of the ravine a great dog . and then another and another ; they ran back and forth barking furiously , until in a few minutes all the huntsmen stood before the cave .
the tender leaves were bursting out of their sheaths . and covering all the trees with a fresh soft mantle of green ; and amongst the carpet of moss under the young man 's feet . yellow primroses and starry anemones were turning up their faces to the morning sky . the little birds were singing like to burst their throats , and hundreds of insects were flying backwards and forwards in the [male] . while down by the burnside the bright eyed water rats were poking their noses out of their holes .
[male] and his friend returned home . the old hag had been previously aware of the fate of [female] . but it was not known by what means she acquired her supernatural knowledge . she was delighted at the issue of her mysterious operations . [female] pressed her much to accept of some remuneration for her services .
[male] went up it and stood looking in at the door . which was open , the glow of the house came from a leaping . jolly fire in a big stone fire place . and from half a dozen squat candles set in brackets around the walls . it was the one lovely room that [male] had ever seen .
but to the fisherwoman these three nations seemed all the same , and she consoled herself with the idea that the child was baptized as a [male] . the boy throve , the noble blood in his veins was warm . and he became strong on his homely fare , he grew apace in the humble house . and the danish dialect spoken by the west jutes became his language . the pomegranate seed from spanish soil became a hardy plant on the coast of [location] .
the prince pined away , lamenting and weeping bitterly for the loss of [male] . and sorely repenting his undue haste , but all was vain , nothing could be changed . so , in his grief and [male] , he resolved not to live any longer without his brother . ordered his own eyes and those of his horse to be bandaged , mounted it . and bade it hasten to the forest where [male] had perished , the horse went as fast as it could , and plump !
so they dispatched him ; and , like a flash . he winged his fiery flight . returning in nine seconds with the water from the [male] . with this they bathed the prince 's wounds . and they healed up at once ; and lo , he rose up alive and well .
as to what remains , my ladies , says he , addressing himself to all the three sisters . since you do me so great honour . do not think that i will abuse it , or look upon myself as a person who deserves it . no , i shall always look upon myself as one of your most humble slaves . when he had spoken these words , he would have returned the money he had received .
it did not seem possible that the thief could do this , it was such a tiny window . but , sure enough , when the door was opened , and [male] and his mother crowded into the pantry . they were but just in time to seize the hem of the old woman 's shawl . as her last leg squeezed through the casement , [female] held on to the shawl tightly . however , and off it came in his hands , it was a very nice shawl .
so , just when he had knocked in the bung , and was putting the tap into the cask . he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen . then off he ran up the cellar steps , with the tap in his hand . as fast as he could , to look after the pig , lest it should upset the churn . but when he got up , and saw the pig had already knocked the churn over .
the patients are then all lodged in houses built for the purpose . one house being for men and one for women . these are not houses which are kept permanently standing , but are specially built on each occasion on which the nose boring operation is going to be performed . a great swelling of the patients noses develops . and this spreads more or less over their faces , the patients are confined in the special houses until the holes in their noses are large enough and the wounds are healed .
we know that you went up steps to it . that you frequently grazed your knees in doing so ; that you generally got your leg over the scraper . in trying to scrape the mud off a very unsteady little shoe , the [male] of the establishment holds no place in our memory . but , rampant on one eternal door mat , in an eternal entry long and narrow . is a [male] pug dog , with a personal animosity towards us .
in the early dawn the air became calm and still , and at sunrise the swans flew away from the rock . bearing their sister with them , the sea was still rough . and from their great height the white foam on the dark green waves looked like millions of swans swimming on the water . as the sun rose higher , [female] saw before her . floating in the air , a range of mountains with shining masses of ice on their summits .
the officer going to the peasant , demanded of him how much he would have for the bird ? `` if it be for his majesty , '' answered the peasant . i humbly beg of him to accept it of me as a present . and i desire you to carry it to him . the officer took the bird to the king .
then [female] went on further still , and soon came to the old oak tree . pushed it with his foot , and it fell over . there , at the roots , was more gold and silver than even mark the rich had . and now the twelve ships which the whale had thrown up came sailing along and anchored close by . on the deck of the first ship stood the three beggars whom [male] had met formerly .
instantly miss [female] set off to bear the tidings to [female] mucklebackit . the old fisherman , while the antiquary himself , with a handkerchief tied round his hat and wig to keep them from being blown away . searched the cliffs for any signs of his late guests . nor was the information brought by caxton one whit exaggerated . sir [male] and his daughter had indeed started out to reach their home by the sands .
after a time he lay down on his back . and prepared to go to sleep , but just then the ring slipped down his throat . and he had to [male] , so that the ring flew out and rolled along the ground , swish ! the rat had caught it , and crept out with it to the cat . who was waiting at the rat hole , but in the meantime the king had caught the youth .
the frog travelled over mountains and valleys . never stopping day or night ; at last she drew near the capital . where the king was in residence , she was surprised to see dancing and festivity in every direction . there was laughter and singing , and the nearer she got to the town . the more joyous and jubilant the people seemed , her rural equipage caused great astonishment .
`` you must catch me first , '' said [male] . and throwing off his coat of darkness , and putting on his shoes of swiftness . he began to run , the giant following him like a walking castle . making the earth shake at every step , [male] led him round and round the walls of the house . that the company might see the monster ; then , to finish the work .
the cliffs were high and steep , but luckily for me some tree roots protruded in places . and by their aid i climbed up at last , and stretched myself upon the turf at the top . where i lay , more dead than alive , till the sun was high in the heavens . by that time i was very hungry , but after some searching i came upon some eatable herbs . and a spring of clear water , and much refreshed i set out to explore the island .
the giant , passing by and seeing [male] . carried him to his castle , where he locked him up in a large room . the floor of which was covered with the bodies , skulls , and bones of men and women . soon after , the giant went to fetch his brother , who was likewise a giant . to take a meal off his flesh , and [male] saw with terror through the bars of his prison the two giants approaching .
when it was finished -- it was built round [female] as she lay on the ground . [female] knocked solemnly at the door , and [female] opened it and came out . very pleased and happy , the lost boys knelt before her , and begged her to be their mother . and [female] them in at night time , and tell them stories before they went to bed . she said that she was not quite sure if she could .
now it happened that the hostess had plotted with a certain monk in market jew to murder the old man in his bed that night while the rest were asleep . and they agreed to lay it on the lodgers . so while [male] was in bed next door . there was a hole in the pine end of the house . and he saw a light through it , so he got up and looked .
on an evening of one of the most beautiful of summer days . all the lovely children were playing and amusing themselves in different parts of this enchanted residence . when all at once there appeared in the air a car drawn by six flame coloured griffins . the car was of the same colour , relieved with black ornaments . it bore the fairy [female] .
van tenner was a man who pursued his way through life by fixed habits . he lived in [location] , that was one of the habits . he ate regularly , slept regularly , rose regularly , worked regularly and went to the club regularly . all this within the limits of a very comfortable income , he never overstrained this income . that 's what kept it so comfortable , it also kept e. van tenner comfortable .
because she was such a wild bird and of a poetic and dreamy temperament . [female] 's practical mind appealed to her , he possessed that which she and her father lacked . she was tired of her father 's promises and castles in the air . which usually ended in bitter disappointment , how many guests had they had since hotel fancy had been opened ? she could almost count them on her fingers .
another thing prince [male] particularly admired was the great number of rose sellers . who crowded the streets ; for the indians are such lovers of that flower . that not one will stir without a nosegay in his hand , or a garland on his head . and the merchants keep them in pots in their shops . so that the air of the whole quarter , however large , is perfectly perfumed .

as the years passed , and her little son began to run , three black days came within a little of each other . for on these days messengers came with the sad news of the death of her other boys . one of them had been done to death by an evil [male] on the lonely wastes by the roman wall . two others were slain by the shores of humber . repelling a horde of fair haired saxon raiders .
went the egg , which was lying hidden in the ashes . and burned the monkey 's arm , surprised and alarmed , he plunged his arm into the pickle tub in the kitchen to relieve the pain of the burn . then the [male] which was hidden near the tub stung him sharply in his face . already wet with tears , without waiting to brush off the [male] , and howling bitterly . he rushed for the back door ; but just then some seaweed entangled his legs and made him slip .
among the guests then present were five aged gentlemen , who were fathers to some of those captives who had been freed by [male] from the dungeon of the giants . as soon as they heard that he was the person who had done such wonders . they pressed round him with tears of joy . to return him thanks for the happiness he had caused them . after this the bowl went round , and every one drank the health and long life of the gallant hero .
the little mermaid swam right up to the cabin windows . and every time she was lifted by the swell she could see through the transparent panes crowds of gaily dressed people . the handsomest of them all was the young prince with large dark eyes . he could not be much more than sixteen , and all these festivities were in honour of his birthday . the sailors danced on deck , and when the prince appeared among them hundreds of rockets were let off making it as light as day .
to this [male] agreed , but he was so hungry that he begged his mother to get him something to eat before they talked further . she took some sand and water to polish it . but scarcely had she begun to rub it when a genie . even more terrible looking than the genie of the ring , appeared before them . the widow was so terrified at the sight of the genie .
as he spoke , he turned his eyes on the young woman and her two blind companions . and started as he did so , [male] never went about without some potent witch charm upon him . which at once protected him from the malice of such creatures . and enabled him to detect them when disguised , and upon this occasion he had nothing less than a relic of the great kentish saint . [male] , being a small piece of the hair shirt of that holy man .
an important addition was now made to the society into which [male] and [male] had been introduced . by the arrival of a young gentleman lately returned from travelling . to take possession of a large estate , and noble mansion annexed to it . in that country , [male] had every thing that could recommend him to the favour of all to whom he was made known . handsome and elegant in his person .
but the festivities of our marriage were scarcely ended , when suddenly by night the city in which we dwelt was attacked by a band of travelling marauders . the attack was so unexpected and so well planned that the town was stormed and the garrison cut to pieces before any news of the event had reached the palace . under cover of darkness we managed to escape . and fleeing to the sea shore took refuge on a small fishing boat . in which we immediately put out to sea , hoping to find in the rude winds and waves a safer shelter than our own walls had afforded us .
and these words were the last that [female] spoke in this world . the thread snapped that bound the immortal soul , and nothing but a dead body lay in the dark church . around which the storm raged , covering it with loose sand . the next morning was sunday , and the congregation and their pastor went forth to the service . the road to church had been heavy ; the sand made the way almost impassable .
next day [female] set out to try his luck . he soon came upon the king of the ants and the king of the beetles . who with their armies had encamped on the field of battle all night . and were ready to begin the fight again , `` cinders , '' said [male] . who was quite as insolent as his brother , and quite as anxious to teach other people good manners .
he assembled the people and ordered the bear 's head off . to be hung outside of the village , that the bear spies , who were lurking in the neighborhood . might see it and carry the news to their chief . the next morning , by break of day . grasshopper had all of his young warriors under arms and ready for a fight .
next day they saw a deal of vessels facing the harbor . and what should they be but a [male] of ships . and on the ships were the king of [male] . lug longhand , the knight of the island of the flood . the dark [male] of the northern island and [male] .
he twitched his ears more sharply when the king 's son threw a pebble at him . then after about three hours he came slowly across the river . from his big knees down he had horse 's feet . `` not carrying any more across , '' said the glashan , the king of [male] 's son drew the sword of light and flashed it . take me on your shoulders. well , come then , you re not the first living dead man i carried across.
so saying , he drew out his favourite whistle , and blew one ear piercing note . whereupon the great lion , who had been dozing in the sunny courtyard , come bounding in on his soft , heavy feet . [female] , said the enchanter . `` go and fetch me the princess , and bring her here at once , be [female] now ! '' at these words [female] went off at a great pace .
this renowned prince lives at bagdad . and as soon as he is informed of your arrival in his capital . you will find that it is not in vain to implore his assistance . it is impossible you can stay any longer in a city where all the objects you see must renew your grief . my vessel is at your service , where you may absolutely command as you shall think fit .
there was once a rich merchant who lived in a raja 's city . and the raja founded a school in order that his own children might have some education . and the boys and the girls of the town used to go to the school as well as the raja 's sons and daughters and among them the rich merchant 's son . whose name was [male] , in the course of time the children all learned to read and write . in the evenings all the boys used to mount their horses and go for a ride .
at each of the four corners of the building , immediately inside the walls . is a post set in the ground and standing six feet nine inches high . the boards of the walls are tied to these corner posts . and the greater part of the weight of the roof rests on their tops . four other posts , also planted in the ground and about as high as the corner posts .
he ordered the messenger to hurry back with his reply . and not to stop anywhere ; but the old soldier could not forget the good glass of spirits he had . and so went into the tent again and had some more , the witch again mixed it with a sleeping draught and searched the bag while the soldier slept . she stole the letter , and , imitating the young prince 's hand writing . wrote back to the old king that he was to have his wife and the young babes killed .
acting on his advice , they chose the biggest mice to be their leaders . and these , in order to be distinguished from the rank and file . provided themselves with helmets bearing large plumes of straw . they then led out the mice to battle . confident of victory : but they were defeated as usual .
he dared not go out far and pick berries , for , by this time . he saw that people were out searching for him . he did not feel yet , like going back to books , rods and scoldings . but the day seemed as long as a week , meanwhile , he discovered that he had a stomach . which seemed to grow more and more into an aching void , he was glad when the sunset and darkness came .
all rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him . and in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants . some to traffic for amber with the rough fisher folk of the north seas . some to [location] to look for that curious green turquoise which is found only in the tombs of kings . and is said to possess magical properties , some to [location] for silken carpets and painted pottery .
then more miracles began to happen to [male] , he was taken from one section to another in the store and when he emerged again into the street . he hardly knew himself , he was wearing new underclothes . stockings , shoes , coat , vest . even the phony legs had been cared for in the trousers . cut off to suit the little fellow 's peculiar needs , and his eyes seemed to have grown larger in the process .
a few days later , when the king sat in hall before the great fire . for it was passing cold and the wintry wind snarled at the windows . the great door was flung open , and into the hall came three men bearing a wounded knight in armour upon his shield . when they had set him down , the knights that were with the king knew him for sir [male] the seneschal . and sir [male] looked sourly about him , and bade those that carried him take him to his pallet and fetch a leech .
thus they arrived at the palace of my father . who assigned the beautiful saracen lady an apartment . and caused her child to be carefully educated , the lady was not insensible of the sultan 's goodness to her . and expressed as much gratitude as he could desire , she had at first appeared very uneasy and impatient that her husband did not claim her . but by degrees she lost that uneasiness .
when [male] tsarevich heard this , he went with his wife to rest . and queen [female] tried in every way to get him to kiss her . but [female] lay quite still and spoke not a word , then [female] laid her hand upon his breast and pressed him so hard that he could scarcely breathe . but up jumped [male] tsarevich and seized the stick which [male] had laid there ready for him . and fell to beating her as hard as he could , on a sudden there arose a storm .
some chairs were simply carved with a shell or leaf or scroll on top rail and knees of the legs . in the more elaborately carved chairs the arms , legs , splat , and top rail were all carved with acanthus leaves . or designs from [person] 's decoration . chairs were broad in the seat and high of back with wide splats . often decorated with inlay , in the early part of the period .
she had entered the borderland and was not far from the elf 's door . when suddenly she encountered him , he was sitting quietly upon a mound of ash . a curious little figure , with eyes that twinkled with a kindly light under thick fuzzy brows . his fuzzy ears stood out from beneath a peaked cap . his pudgy hands were almost hidden by the sleeves of the soft ashen garment that clothed him from head to foot .
the fairy man then led [male] to the door . and gave a wave of his hand in the direction of the sky . instantly the sound of the fluttering and swish of wings was heard . and in a moment a splendid [organization] landed gracefully at their feet . taking their seats upon its back , they found themselves flashing at lightning speed away through the darkness of the night .
then [female] looked again , and saw that what she had taken for a huge bouquet of red roses on a low stand against the wall . was in fact a fire which burned in the shapes of the loveliest and reddest roses . glowing gorgeously between the heads and wings of two cherubs of shining silver . and when she came nearer , she found that the smell of roses with which the room was filled . came from the fire roses on the hearth , her grandmother was dressed in the loveliest pale blue velvet .
this prince little resembled his uncle : he had been much spoiled in infancy . and it was impossible to improve him , one day . while conversing with [male] , `` sire , '' said he . i have a favour to ask your majesty . and i pray you not to refuse me .
everychild seemed really to lose control of himself . he gazed , and then he advanced in a manner so determined that [male] drew back . leaving him alone with the sleeper , save for the [male] on the pillow and the lady of honor asleep in her chair . `` it is the sleeping beauty , '' exclaimed everychild , somehow or other he knew positively . he knelt down beside her and gazed at her reverently , slowly and gently he reached for the hand nearest him .
as soon as the tailor 's widow had retired , overjoyed to see her son raised to such exalted fortune . the sultan put an end to the audience . and rising from his throne , ordered that the princess 's eunuchs should come and carry the trays into their [male] 's apartment . whither he went himself to examine them with her at his leisure . the fourscore slaves were conducted into the palace .
suddenly she heard the sound of footsteps tramping on the cobblestones . and round the corner of the street she saw a dark figure coming along . which seemed to her to be a man , it was dark now , and the sky was a deep and wonderful blue . the moon had not risen , and only a few stars twinkled , very large and bright . the figure walked slowly along , keeping close to the walls of the houses opposite to her .
and in an instant all was gone , two eyes now awakened [female] , and said . [female] , you want to take care of the goat . and go to sleep while you are doing it , and in the meantime the goat might run all over the world . come , let [location] go home again , so they went home . and again two eyes let her little dish stand untouched , and [female] could not tell her mother why she would not eat it .
after the abduction of his daughter [female] by [female] . [male] , king of phoenicia . unable to reconcile himself to her loss , despatched his son [male] in search of her . desiring him not to return without his sister , for many years [male] pursued his search through various countries . but without success , not daring to return home without her .
the turf blazed brightly on the hearth , and within was sunlight , the sparkling light from the sunny eyes of a child . the birdlike tones from the rosy lips ringing like the song of a lark in spring . all was life and joy , little [female] sat on ib 's knee . ib was to her both father and mother . her own parents had vanished from her memory , as a dream picture vanishes alike from childhood and age .
if it had been a fine sight to see the mermaid chasing the white horse across the bay . it was far finer to see them come prancing back again , the mermaid was not swimming this time . but riding on the back of the angry white horse , who plunged and galloped across the bay . tossing his long mane , and the mermaid tossed her golden hair and laughed . because she was enjoying her ride , [female] too .
there were three , therefore , that did not go ; the others hastened on . the sun shone , the birds sang . and the children sang too , and each held the other by the hand ; for as yet they had none of them any high office . and were all of equal rank in the eye of god . but two of the youngest soon grew tired , and both returned to town ; two little girls sat down .
and everybody laughed so much at the old woman that she was forced to bite her own tongue and listen to her husband . and the husband bought wares with his treasure . went to live in the town , and began to trade there , exchanged his wares for money . grew rich and prosperous , and was as happy as the day was long , once upon a time there lived in a village a miserably poor peasant called [male] . [male] 's tongue could wag right well , and in mother wit he was no worse than his neighbours .
drenched and perishing with cold , the [male] voyagers were rescued from the bleak shore . and hospitably entertained by the poor islanders , who little imagined that in these storm beaten mariners they beheld the great king [male] . the wise queen [female] . and the [female] princess [female] . it is true that the queen , with that prudence and forethought which occasionally guided her smaller actions .
the prince , moved by pity , without thinking what he was doing . ran to the courtyard of the castle , and filled a jug with water . which he poured over the man in the cauldron . in a moment a most fearful crash was heard , as if all the pillars of the palace were giving way . and the palace itself , with towers and doors .
when everything was arranged according to the fairy 's pleasure . she said to [female] , this all belongs to you . and you have nothing to study but how to avail yourself of it . she then showed her a basket full of ornaments and a jewel case crammed with precious stones as perfect in themselves as they were tastefully set . saying to her , beautiful [female] , this little jewel box will amuse you .
as soon as he received the sword he anointed six of the dolls with the ointment . and they were able immediately to dance so gracefully that all the living girls in the room could not help joining in the dance . the coachman danced with the cook , and the waiters with the chambermaids . and all the strangers joined ; even the tongs and the fire shovel made an attempt . but they fell down after the first jump , so after all it was a very merry night .
so she went in to her mother , and as she arrived thus covered with gold . she was well received , both by her and her sister , the girl told all that had happened to her . and as soon as the mother heard how she had come by so much wealth . she was very anxious to obtain the same good luck for the ugly and lazy daughter . she had to seat herself by the well and spin .
then she gradually came to her senses ; but not until long afterward was she altogether herself . and she told how she had firmly believed that her sweetheart himself . and all their friends and relatives had been there , he took her straight back to the village with him . and so that they need fear no such deviltry in the future . they celebrated their wedding while she was still clad in the bridal outfit of the underground folk .

birds built nests within the vine . and hatched their young , and sang loudly and sweetly to their friends in the hut as often as they cared to hear . nothing pleased [female] half as much as to sit in the shadow of the vines . watch the flowers grow , and feel that all this beauty was violet 's work . for the old gardener loved flowers dearly ; and when he had grown too old to work himself .
i could not but agree there was a great deal of justice in what the dervish said . but without considering what riches i should gain in accepting of the condition he proposed . i could not without reluctance think of parting with my forty camels . especially when i reflected that the dervish would then be as rich as myself . avarice made me unmindful that i was beforehand making an ungrateful return for a favour , purely gratuitous .
as time went on , prince [male] had two younger brothers . whom everybody liked , they were not a bit clever , but jolly . prince [male] , the third son . was round , fat , good humoured , and as brave as a lion , prince [male] . the second , was tall , thin , and a little sad , but never too clever .
as none of them could catch him . miss [female] let him alone till [female] waked up and could go and find some of the big boys to help him . [female] soon left the roof , and skipped in at a window that stood open . it was little [female] brown 's play room . and she had left her pet doll [female] rose [female] very ill in the best bed .
it is a wonder [female] did not bite her . for he was so strong he could have done so , he was a very [male] cat , [male] ? i hear some one ask , then why did he deserve such a whipping as the little girl was giving him ? that is a question we must try to have answered , for my part i do not believe he deserved it at all . let [location] see what happened next , just as the little girl struck the last blow her aunt [female] came into the room .
in spite , however , of opposition in high places . the custom of using the smaller rooms became more common , and we shall find the furniture . as time goes on , designed accordingly , in the south kensington museum there is a very remarkable cabinet . the decoration of which points to its being made in england at this time . that is , about the middle , or during the latter half , of the sixteenth century .
the supply of painted furniture today is inspired by these different kinds of the great periods of decoration . there are many grades and kinds in the market . some very fine , keeping up the old traditions of beauty , some charming and effective in style and color . but with a modern touch , and some very very bad indeed ; `` and when they are bad they are horrid . '' i have said a great deal in other chapters on this subject .
and they answered with one accord , `` that may she do with honour . '' [female] grew red for love and joy . and vowed his service to [male] , and they bade them stand together in a circle . and asked her if she would take the knight , on maidenly wise she was shamefast at the first . yet so great was [male] 's good fortune and his [female] .
at length one day , when the sun was shining brightly over [female] 's plain . and its light , softened by the intervening curtains . was falling in the sick chamber , the royal watchers noticed a sweet change coming over the face of the princess . the bloom of love and youth were flushing on her cheeks . and from her eyes shone out the old , soft , tender light .
they are essential in the right development of a child 's mind . they embody the poetic fancy of the race . they stimulate a child 's imagination . feed his fancy , and satisfy poetically his groping after things unseen . his craving for such tales is due to a normal growth of mind .
and the door being barred , the two children , sometimes speaking together , often interrupting one another . often interrupted by their mother , managed to tell this strange story , which i had better relate connectedly and in my own language . under the great old ash trees , whose last leaves were falling at their feet . in the light of an october sunset , they were playing with the hilarity and eagerness of rustic children . clamouring together , and their faces were turned toward the west and storied hill of [person] .
for , in a few moments , he came rushing round the corner shouting out , `` stop , stop , will you ? '' and as his eyes were fixed on the road far in advance . of course he did not notice her . and was soon round another bend in the road , the princess noticed that he had the eagle hanging with its claws round his neck . and the jolting , as he went by , had shaken one of its large tail feathers out .
then at last the silence was broken , and a roar of triumph and relief burst from the crowd . slowly the young man turned and rode along the lists . pausing before the lady radimere as she sat by the sultan . `` you are free , princess , '' he said . as he lifted his vizor ; and with those words he disappeared in the crowd .
but in spite of herself something made [female] look straight at `` cousin [female] , '' and now that she saw her at close quarters . the splendour of her jewels , the priceless lace in which she was draped . almost took away the younger woman 's breath , she half gasped . and then , feeling her eyes caught and held as it were by the strange power of the piercing black ones .
as the sun was going down the queen came , and was not a little astonished when she saw the stately knight with her husband . the king drew his sword and ran towards her . but the moment the sword touched her clothing it broke in two . it would have been bad for the king now , if he had not remembered the twig which the boatman gave him . he pulled it out quickly , and struck the queen three times .
the author had just returned from a year 's visit to his son . who was a sheep herder in [location] , and the character of [male] was acknowledged to be based on his son .

the men sprang to him , laid him on a cot . pulled off his furs , and unbuttoned his coat , underneath the coat was an old sack . one of the men gave it a shake . out on the floor rolled a half frozen , half smothered kitten , it told the story . it told them that [male] was a hero .
then the king dismissed the council , and they went away in silence . with dark and heavy looks , a proclamation was sent out as the king commanded . saying that whoever could kill the stoorworm or drive it away should have the princess . and the half of the kingdom as a reward . and the king 's sword , and after the king 's death should reign over the whole realm .
aware of their danger , the rulers resolved to avert it by an imposing display of strength . and perhaps to confirm their despotism by yet harsher measures , one afternoon in [male] . 1689 , sir [male] andros and his favourite councillors . being warm with wine , assembled the red coats of the governor 's guard . and made their appearance in the streets of [location] .
once in the still hours of night , she was awakened by the notes of her own harp vibrating in the most exquisite harmony . she lay motionless until the last note died away , and it was long before she fell asleep . for the spell of the rich melodies still floated through the air around her . in the morning she spoke of it . but no one could explain the mystery , again and again , in the silent hours came the rich melody .
when he reached it , he sent them home again with one of the lanterns . and taking the other in his hand , he boldly ascended a long flight of steps . arrived at the top , he found himself in a spacious hall . which had doors on all sides , he opened the first he came to . entered a chamber , and seating himself at an old-fashioned table .
but no sooner did the fair herald set foot on board his vessel than [female] set sail and carried her off to athens . where he made her his queen . enraged at this indignity the amazons determined to be revenged , some time afterwards . when the whole affair would { 265 } appear to have been forgotten , they seized the opportunity when the city of athens was in a defenceless condition and landed an army in attica . so sudden was their attack that they had penetrated into the very heart of the city before the athenians could organize their forces .
ivan sat on the carpet that flies of itself . flew out of the underground kingdom , and had not time to wink before he found himself in a beautiful garden . he went to a pond , sat under a laburnum bush , and began to look and admire the gold and silver fish swimming in the clear water . before five minutes had passed , [female] the wise had flown to the pond with her maid . they took off their wings at once , put them near the [female] .
and [male] went on to relate what happened on the goose pasture , and how when there he had to chase his hat . the aged king commanded him to drive his flock out again next day . and as soon as morning came , he placed himself behind the dark gateway . and heard how the [male] spoke to the head of [male] . and then he too went into the country , and hid himself in the thicket in the meadow .
he must not die ; so she swam towards him all among the drifting beams and planks . quite forgetting that they might crush her , she dived deep down under the water . and came up again through the waves , and at last reached the young prince just as he was becoming unable to swim any further in the stormy sea . his limbs were numbed , his beautiful eyes were closing , and he must have died if the little mermaid had not come to the rescue . she held his head above the water and let the waves drive them whithersoever they would .
the [organization] closed his eyes , [male] flung a score of skates into his mouth . `` hard meat , hard meat , '' said the [organization] . but he gulped them down , [male] , holding the cup in his hands and carrying the basket of skates on his back . put himself between the wings of the [organization] . the [organization] flew up and over the grey castle and faced for the plain of the sea .

a song was made about `` the girl who trod on a loaf to keep her shoes from being soiled , '' and this song was sung everywhere , the story of her sin was also told to the little children . and they called her `` wicked [female] , '' and said she was so naughty that she ought to be punished , [female] heard all this . and her heart became hardened and full of bitterness , but one day .
it did not take long for [male] to find out that his companions had left him to die in the pit . but he had a brave heart , and hoped that he might be able to find a way out for himself . so he at once began to explore the pit and found it ran back a long way underground . and by night he slept , and by day he took a little of the honey he had gathered and ate it . and so many days passed by , he went along the path .
this domino was the lord [male] . a great friend of the prince , but still more the friend of his own pleasure . in an unguarded moment the doctor had said that morning by chance . under the seal of secrecy , and to two ladies only . that the prince would wear pink rosettes in his black domino .
the christening over , the procession went back to the castle . past the waiting rows of bystanders , not one of whom had changed his place or gone away . so superb had been the spectacle , the christening banquet was laid in the great hall of the castle . and , thanks to the court astrologer . things went off beautifully , it was the only large banquet ever known in the history of the world where courses were served all at one time .

but i knew that that would be fatal , and i continued to lie inert and speechless in the arms of the tailors . i risked opening my eyes from time to time . and i saw that [male] was leading the way from room to room . all dark except for moonlight here and there upon the floors , and that he came at last . followed by all the others , into the court of the dry fountain .
the young man cast a hasty glance at the figure . and then shouted aloud with delight , it was the old man of whom he had just been thinking . and it was with grateful emotion that he found that his old friend had not forgotten him . but that , in spite of the darkness and his increasing infirmities . he had toiled up the path to the mountains .
there seemed no escape , but once -- once i came near to understanding , once the door into unknown about things nearly opened for me . and just for a moment i caught a glimpse . i had been told to tidy my top bureau drawer . i have always loathed tidying my top bureau drawer . it is so unlike a real task , it is made up of odds and ends of tasks that ought to have been despatched long ago and gradually .

the great church door flew open wide , and as they walked up the broad aisle . soft tones of music sounded from the organ . `` our master first , '' said the gingerbread pair . making room for [female] and [female] . as they knelt at the altar , [female] bent her head over him .
but there was no discouragement in this , it was agreeable to contemplate ; for it made the fireside warmer in possession . and the summer greener in expectancy . the river looked chilly ; but it was in motion . and moving at a good pace ; which was a great point , the canal was rather slow and torpid . that must be admitted , never mind , it would freeze the sooner when the frost set fairly in .
`` yes , '' replied together the negro and negress , who held her by each hand . by the bishop 's orders , [female] knelt down and undressed [female] . the child was quite naked ; round her neck was an amulet . the pontiff plunged her three times into the baptismal font . the acolytes brought the oil , with which [male] anointed the catechumen .
in this way they kept on at it . framing high compliments ; one answering the other , and their feet going with the music as fast as their tongues . all the fish kept dancing , too ; [male] heard the clatter and was afraid to stop playing lest it might be displeasing to the fish . and not knowing what so many of them may take it into their heads to do to him if they got vexed . well , the lady with the green hair kept on coaxing [female] with soft speeches .
it now became a very serious question with them where they were to spend the night . there was no sign of any human habitation round about . there was the sandy beach along which they were walking , and there was the wide expanse of the river . on which the evening mists were slowly gathering ; but no appearance of life . just as they were wondering what course they should pursue .
`` what is it that you desire ? '' he asked ungraciously . for he was no friend to the shadow witch and made naught of her servants . this said , curling smoke settled again into a cleft from whence he could watch the entire plain of ash . no one could approach him from thence without being seen by him . black shadow assured of the vigilance of this powerful ally , departed at once to seek the ash goblin .
he had barely finished his sentence when he found himself and his animal friends in his palace once more . and near him was his wife , the jew was cast into the bottomless sea . where he is sinking everlastingly but never reaches the bottom , thus the wicked one was punished and the virtuous one attained his wishes . may heaven grant that you may all be virtuous and attain your wishes , three apples fell from heaven . one for me , one for the story teller , and one for the man who entertained the company .
well , i actually believe that [female] would gladly have spent the rest of her life clinging to the edge of the moon and peeping over at the babies in that beautiful garden . but the dream fairies agreed that this would never do at all , they finally got [female] away by promising to stop on their journey home to replenish her nursing bottle at the milky way . which , as perhaps you know , is a [female] lacteal ocean in the very midst of the sky . this beverage had so peculiar and so soothing a charm that presently [female] went sound asleep . and when she woke up -- goodness me , it was late in the morning .
now , when he got down ; there sat doll i the grass on a chair ; she was so lovely and so smart . and she asked boots whither he was going . and what was his business , so he told her how there were twelve brothers of them . and how the king had given them horses and mail .
lady [female] shut herself up in her own room . her `` bower , '' the servants called it . soon [male] heard heavy steps on the stairs , and whispering . he wanted to run out , and his nurse caught hold of him . and would not have let him go , but he slipped out of her hand .
`` ah , '' said the woman , `` it was louder to me than thunder . '' then , after she had set before them a supper of bread and milk . she rocked her baby . and sang to it a sweet cradle song about mother [female] and high olympus . the children lay down on beds of rushes .
now ever after this , the prince kept wondering what his wife 's real name could be . till he made himself quite unhappy , now , one morning . the princess awoke very early , but she felt so happy that she could not sleep . she lay awake and listened to the birds singing . and then she watched a fairy boy teasing a bird , which sang out of tune .
at these words the magician , who pretended sickness only to know where the prince lived and what he did . refused not the charitable offer he made her . and that her actions might correspond with her words she made many pretended vain endeavors to get up . at the same time two of the prince 's attendants . alighting off their horses , helped her up , and set her behind another .
she sprang from bed and dressed so hurriedly that i am afraid her hair did not receive its due amount of brushing . then she ran out into the garden , the older fairies stood all in a group . saying loudly `` i will go , '' and `` i will go , '' and before them . scarcely touching the ground with the tip of her foot . stood poised a glorious fairy , taller than any other there , she was altogether beautiful .
on [female] went -- following a circle of green and gold that was marked on the trees and seemed to show him the way . he sang and shouted merrily to keep up his spirits ; it was supper time . and the night air had made him hungry . so he unpacked his bread and sausage and made a good meal . the moon had risen , and threw a glimmer of light through the trees .
that was three hundred years ago , and still the solid rock vaulted the old warrior 's slumber . and over his head men talked of him . and told how he was reserving the strength of his old age till his country should again call for him . the call seemed to come now ; for his descendant , little duke [male] the ninth . was but a child ; and being in no fear of him .
now the fox had not forgotten the trick the coon had played on him . his head was still sore from that great thump against the apple tree . so the fox started after the coon , he was gaining . and would have caught him , had they not come to a tall pine tree . the coon ran to the very tiptop of the pine tree .
the chief minister bowed low , took the ring and called a goodly number of soldiers and servants to accompany him on his [male] . as soon as he held the magic ring in his hand . he felt a strange power drawing him . and as he yielded to that power , it led him out of the pleasure gardens to the bank of the stream . and then up along the bank straight toward the log hut in the woods .
the mother put forth all her strength , but the bell . which the spirits moved so easily , would not yield an inch before the woman 's efforts . when the old water sprite heard it sound , he went to one of the high arched windows . and saw the widow struggling to overturn her poor child 's prison . he beckoned to his sons , and quickly but noiselessly the three left the palace .
`` he 's won , he 's won amongst [location] all , '' shrieked out the eldritch crew , and all came around her and tried their spells on young [male] . first they turned him in [male] 's arms like frozen ice . then into a huge flame of roaring fire , then , again , the fire vanished and an adder was skipping through her arms . but still she held on ; and then they turned him into a snake that reared up as if to bite her .
midnight tied up his head with a handkerchief . and lay down under the bench , groaning and groaning , unable to put his head to the ground . or even to lay it in the crook of his arm . it was so bruised by the beating given it by the little old man . in the evening the brothers rode back , and found midnight groaning under the bench .
the five pilgrims having entered the city , repaired immediately to the abode of the respected devotee . the courts of which were crowded with petitioners from all parts . so that they could with difficulty gain admission . some of her domestics seeing they were strangers newly arrived . and seemingly fatigued , kindly invited them , into an apartment , and to repose themselves while they informed their [female] of their arrival .
he knew what the bees hummed and where they flew to load themselves with honey . butterflies lighted upon his hands and taught him strange things . birds told him of their travels . and brought him seeds from far countries which he planted in his gardens and which bloomed into marvelous flowers . a swallow who loved him very much and who had seen many wonderful lands once brought him a seed from an emperor 's secret garden which none but four of his own slaves had ever seen .
`` stop , [male] , '' he panted -- truth to tell . the running was harder on him than on his sister . for [male] was of an easy going disposition , and not given to violent exercise -- stop , [female] , she 's lighted on the old gateway . they both stood still and looked , yes , there was madam [female] on the topmost bar of a dilapidated wooden gate .
so the old woman opened the door and [female] slept in her house . the king was very angry at her for playing truant , but when she returned home the next day . she found the plants of her sisters withered away . because they had disobeyed their father , now the window in the room of the eldest overlooked the gardens of the king . and when she saw how fine and ripe the medlars were on the trees .
you are in the right path , now , darling -- god grant that you may never be induced to deviate from it ! go on as you have commenced , and , believe me , more happiness will be yours than you have ever dreamed of . there is no richer treasure in this world -- no greater blessing . no more unalloyed happiness to a woman than the perfect trust and love of a good husband . the tie that binds the wedded is one that must be guarded well , or it may become partially unloosed .
i shall come twice more , and then never again , said she , this time also . as before , she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it . and the gold dropped down as she did it . and again she sent the dog out three times . and when day dawned she departed , but as she was going she said as she had said before .
now , this was a little awkward , for the five and forty poets were all present . and being mostly the younger sons of kings , who had only taken up poetry as an accomplishment . they were also suitors for the princess 's hand . which made it more awkward still , so the queen coughed uncomfortably , and all the ladies in waiting blushed uncomfortably . and the five and forty poets naturally looked uncomfortable into the bargain , but the little princess .
now the emperor was accustomed to have his lightest word obeyed . almost before it was uttered , and he hardly knew how to believe his ears . but he got together another army , and marched straight off to the castle . but directly they took up their position [male] girded them about with a great river . so that they could neither move hand nor foot .
when the battle began the [male] 's mother kept calling out well , [male] . have you killed my son ? this enraged [male] and he kept running after the old woman to drive her away . and this gave the opportunity to the [female] to get in a good blow . in this way they fought for seven days and nights and at the end [male] was defeated and killed . then the raja gave half his kingdom to the [male] and married him to his daughter [female] .
we will not say , like that french authoress : now , then , let me die . the world has no more discoveries to make , o , there is so endlessly much in the sea . in the air , and on the earth -- wonders , which science will bring forth ! wonders , greater than the poet 's philosophy can create ! a bard will come , who , with a child 's mind .
then the [female] fairy folded her little arms around [female] 's neck . laid a soft kiss on her cheek , and , spreading wide her shining wings . flew singing up among the white clouds floating in the sky , and little [female] sat among her flowers . and watched with wondering joy the fairy [female] shining on her breast . the pleasant days of spring and summer passed away .
he must read out the sentence distinctly , if the sentence be a long document . to begin reading in a very loud voice and afterwards drop into a whisper has an appearance of faint heartedness . but to read it throughout in a low voice is worse still : it should be delivered clearly from beginning to end . it is the duty of the chief witness to set an example of fortitude to the other persons who are to take part in the execution . when the second has finished his work , he carries the head to the chief witness .
plants of great power were the mòthan and achlasan challum chille . the former protected its possessor from fire and the attacks of the fairy women . the latter warded off fevers , and kept the fairies from taking people away in their sleep . there are rhymes which must be said when these plants are pulled , stories representing the bible as a [person] must be of a recent date . it is not so long since a copy of the bible was not available in the highlands for that or any other purpose .
mermei glanced down at her blue silk tunic embroidered in white and gold . at her scarlet shoes beaded at the tips so as to resemble the heads of kittens . and looking over to a mirror hung on the side of the wall where the sun shone . noted the purple rosettes in her hair and the bright butterfly 's wing . `` oh , no , honorable mother , '' said she , shaking her head with quite a shocked air .
at this early period some important changes in the barbaric code had been made . the sentence of death when once given had to be carried out , and no arrangements between the interested parties could avert it . a crime could no longer be condoned by the payment of money . robbery even , which was still leniently regarded at that time , and beyond the rhine even honoured . was pitilessly punished by death , we therefore can not have more striking testimony than this of the abridgment of the privileges of the frankish aristocracy .
mrs. [female] then she must have one of edith 's old ones . here , [female] , see this child dressed in one of miss edith 's frocks . keep an eye upon her , and do not let her steal any thing , [female] . [female] , run and tell the men to go and look for edith . and find [female] as soon as possible , [female] , here i am , mother ; what do you wish ?
after that they sat and talked for long and long , while the blue sea sparkled in the summer morning sun . when , at length , they rose to go , there was a light that never shone on land or sea in his face and in hers . there had been no further promises ; only that one : `` when you get back i will be there . '' but each heart understood the other , and she rejoiced to wait further declaration of his love until he could . according to his tender fancy , make it to her as in his `` dream come true . ''
and as she looked at the little glass whirlpool in the saucer . there was the tzar , the little father -- god preserve him ! sitting on his high throne , ships sailed on the seas . their white sails swelling in the wind , there was [location] with its white stone walls and painted churches . why , there were the market at nijni novgorod , and the arab merchants with their camels .
shoes , and head dresses of a definite style . belong to a much more modern period , as also do the many varieties of female dress . which have been known at all times and in all countries under the general name of robes . the girdle was only used occasionally , and its adoption depended on circumstances . the women used it in the same way as the men .
alas , poor boy , what could he do ? the busy crowd swept past : but all on self intent . or pelf , no eye on him was cast . he strove to beg : some heard him not , and some would not believe . some heard him and believed him too , but yet would not relieve , oh ! hunger is a galling thing .
not long afterwards the two sisters went to angle in the brook , meaning to catch fish for dinner . as they were drawing near the water they perceived something . looking like a large grasshopper , springing towards the stream , as if it were going in . they hurried up to see what it might be , and found that it was the dwarf . `` where are you going ? '' said [person] , `` surely you will not jump into the water ? ''
in an eastern city there once lived a young prince named [male] . he was virtuous and accomplished , but had one fault -- he was a bit of a coward ! prince [male] 's father had recently died . and he was looking forward to his coronation , a few days before the day fixed for the ceremony . the old vizier called upon the prince and informed his royal highness that before he could ascend the throne he must in accordance with an ancient custom .
ophelia , who now began to feel sure that she was safe , was too much rejoiced thereat to wish harm to anyone else . and in a few well chosen words she begged her godmother not to be severe on the poor creatures . who , she was certain , would never do it again , she also told her of the better behaviour of the two daughters of [female] . upon which the old lady cut their sacks open immediately , but could hardly be restrained from punishing the others . especially paraphernalia , who cried like a great baby from sheer fright and begged [female] to forgive her .
so [male] went back with the king and the princess to his own palace . and then the princess and [male] were married , and lived happily ever after , the little cat lived in the palace with them . and always the softest cushion , and the warmest corner by the fire were left for him . as for [male] 's brothers , when they heard of the good fortune that had come to [male] . and how he had won a princess for a wife .
the prince suddenly began to remember things , when shall i be as tall as the lady [male] ? ', he cried . but the daddy longlegs had no time to do anything but chuckle before the waking up dream came and seized hold of the prince . and he found himself falling , falling , falling -- down , down , down -- until he dropped with a [location] on a soft grass lawn . and found himself in the middle of the most beautiful garden in the world . a little way off stood an old grey castle .
the twin ki at once left the room . and the high ki sat down and began to ask questions of prince marvel and [male] about the big outside world from whence they came . [male] was rather shy and bashful before the dainty little [female] . whose yellow robe contrasted delightfully with her pink cheeks and blue eyes and brown flowing locks . but prince marvel did not mind girls at all .
when he came he found the cottage deserted . he ran from one room to another , without being able to find any one . he then hastened into the village , hoping to see some of the neighbours . who could inform him where he could find his mother . an old woman at last directed him to a neighbouring house .
so the princess said she had got leave to go to church and hear the priest preach . but she had no clothes to go in , so he brought out a kirtle . which was as bright as the copper wood , and she got a horse and saddle beside . now , when she got to the church she was so lovely and grand . all wondered who she could be , and scarce one of them listened to what the priest said .
but no matter how the tsar tried to detain [male] . he could not avoid letting him go at his urgent prayer . [male] took a blessing of his father . chose a horse , and rode away ; he rode on , not knowing himself whither . [male] went away from tsar dolmat in great grief .
`` oh , '' exclaimed several , thinking it very grand to have the first telling . and i daresay there might be a peculiar freshness about it , because everything would be nearly as new to the story teller himself as to the listeners . some were only sitting up and some were lying down , so there could not be the same busy gathering . bustling , and shifting to and fro with which children generally prepare themselves to hear a story . but their faces , and the turning of their heads , and many feeble exclamations of expected pleasure .
in bechuanaland when a crocodile clansman sees a crocodile he spits on the ground and says . `` there is sin , '' for fear the sight should give him inflammation of the eyes . yet the crocodile is his father , and he celebrates it at his festivals and marks his cattle with an incision in the ear that resembles the mouth of his totem animal . the inhabitants of the ellice island in the south pacific believe the island was first inhabited by the porcupine fish . whose offspring became men and women , the snake clan among the moquis of [location] say they are descended from a woman who gave birth to snakes .
the emperor , without a plan , has won the victory with a fan . the silver islanders had paused in their flight at the [female] noises coming from the harbor . and now all of them , hearing [male] oko 's cries . came crowding down to the shore and were soon cheering themselves hoarse , no wonder ! the drenched soldiers of the king were climbing swiftly back into their boats .
fin chewed his [male] to know what should he do . when he knew , he blew the great whistle with his two hands . which was heard by [male] and [male] o'duivne . the fear ruadh fell to and killed three of the men . but before he could touch the fourth [male] and [male] were there .
`` let america watch over you , '' said they . they lifted her like a feather weight , and carried her into the house . there , in the ingle nook , she sat and shivered , while they brought rose leaves and piled round her . but every hour she grew less and less , presently the sun shone full upon her from the doorway . its light went through her as through coloured glass ; and her man and his wife saw .
the merchant was now very happy , he told the captain to seek out and bring back what he himself might think was the best thing on earth . but to make sure , he must buy a cargo of wheat . in dantzig , all the ship 's men had a good time . for the captain made `` goed koop '' , then the vessel . richly loaded with grain , turned its prow homeward , arriving at stavoren .
the honeymoon of prince [male] and the crown princess [female] was passed at the castle . where the prince had been deserted by the court , but now it was delightfully fitted up . and master [male] marched about the house with his tail in the air . as if the place belonged to him , now , on the second day of their honeymoon . the prince and princess were sitting in the garden together .
then [female] lifted little [female] up to the frame and placed his feet in the picture . on the high grass , and there he stood with the sun shining down upon him through the branches of the trees . he ran to the water and seated himself in a little boat which lay there . and which was painted red and white , the sails glittered like silver , and six swans . each with a golden circlet round its neck and a bright , blue star on its forehead .
weeping as one smitten with pain he flung himself down beside it . and he kissed the cold red of the mouth . and toyed with the wet amber of the hair , he flung himself down beside it on the sand . weeping as one [male] with joy , and in his brown arms he held it to his breast . cold were the lips , yet he kissed them .
we are not thirsty. ' very well , we will not go , answered the two elder girls . but [female] said , i shall go , anyhow. she left the room . and went to the hall where she put out the light . and putting down the key and the bottle , ran to the house of a neighbour . and knocked at the door , who is there so late ? asked the old woman .
and therefore it is , that there are dozens and hundreds of things in the world which we should certainly have said were contrary to nature . if we did not see them going on under our eyes all day long . if people had never seen little seeds grow into great plants and trees . of quite different shape from themselves , and these trees again produce fresh seeds . to grow into fresh trees , they would have said , the thing can not be .
it was nothing to mr. [male] . that the expenditure of fuel , and time . and labour was so greatly increased by his arrangement -- it was nothing that his wife was constantly annoyed by complaints . threats , and changes in her kitchen . or that several mortifying failures in her cuisine had resulted from the obstinate refusal of the oven to bake .
she saw the last of him at the door of the hut . and he had not taken two steps before she had gone back into the hut to see to more important business , no matter . the fool of the world set off with his bag over his shoulder . singing as he went , for he was off to seek his fortune and marry the tzar 's daughter . he was sorry his mother had not given him any corn brandy .
it seemed to him that for the second time he had lost his dear lady . and he turned homewards in bitter despair . his way led him through the grounds of a certain temple . and as he went he marked two graves that were side by side . one was little and obscure , but the other was marked by a fair monument .
in addition to those children of heaven and earth already enumerated . [person] and [person] produced two distinctly different races of beings called giants and titans . the giants personified brute strength alone , but the titans united to their great physical power intellectual qualifications variously developed . there were three giants , briareus , cottus , and gyges . who each possessed a hundred hands and fifty heads , and were known collectively by the name of the hecatoncheires .
when the princess [female] al buddoor was completely dressed . she consulted her glass and women upon her adjustment . and when she found she wanted no charms to flatter the foolish passion of [location] . she sat down on a sofa expecting his arrival . the magician came at the usual hour , and as soon as he entered the great hall where the princess waited to receive him .
`` away , away , '' barked the yard dog , and then he turned round three times and crept into his kennel to sleep . there really was a change in the weather , toward morning a thick fog covered the whole country and a keen wind arose . so that the cold seemed to freeze one 's bones , but when the sun rose . a splendid sight was to be seen , trees and bushes were covered with hoarfrost and looked like a forest of white [male] . while on every twig glittered frozen dewdrops , the many delicate forms .
he took a delicate piece from the small of the back and was just on the point of putting it to his mouth . when a tree close by made a creaking noise . he seemed vexed at the sound , he raised the morsel to his mouth the second time . when the tree creaked again , why , he exclaimed , i can not eat when i hear such a noise . stop , stop , he said to the tree , he put the meat down , exclaiming --
[female] took the strength out of him . and when [male] woke up he was a blind old man and the messenger went out and brought him home . [male] lived on for a time as before , the cook sent him his food . the boy served him , and [male] listened to the stories of the fenians of erin . [male] had a neighbor , a jew .
uta and her women ceased not to comfort her . but her heart was wounded so deep that she could not be cheered , she sorrowed for [female] more than wife ever did for husband . her great love appeared therein , and she mourned him to the end . while her life endured , strong and true she took vengeance at the last . so she remained till the fourth year after her husband 's death .
so when he got back to the king , with the seven silver ducks . he was more liked than ever , and even the king was pleased to say . `` well done , '' but at this his brothers grew more and more spiteful and envious . and so they went and told the coachman that their brother had said . if he chose , he was man enough to get the king the [male] 's bed quilt .
she is also a painter of portraits and genre pictures . and has exhibited at the salon des beaux arts , [location] . miss [female] has been appointed as delegate from [location] to the international congress on instruction in drawing to be held at berne next august . her appointment was recommended by the secretary of the interior . [location] commissioner of education . and prof. [female] , miss [female] has also received letters from [location] from m. [female] genoud .
thereupon he gave into her hands the dish . with king [female] 's head upon it . when [female] raised the cloth and beheld the head . she was so horror struck that for some time she could not utter a word . at length she fell to tearing her hair and clothes .
the bedouin had a handsome wife , and frequently when he went on his excursions left my brother alone with her . at such times she used all her endeavours to comfort my brother under the rigour of his slavery . she gave him tokens enough that she loved him . but he durst not return her passion , for fear he should repent . and therefore avoided being alone with her , as much as she sought the opportunity to be alone with him .
when the hawthorns were white with the snows of spring . and the daisies showed their golden centres on the grassy slopes . we heard him crying for his mother . [male] flew to his side , and gathered him in her arms . her lovely hair covered his shivering limbs , and the desolate child clung close to her as she held the silver horn to his curved red lips .
at the end of the week he had the sum he desired . hurrying to the shop where he had seen the ring . before going inside he gave one hasty , almost frightened look into the window . could it be gone , no , there it was flashing and sparkling as before . years afterwards [male] learned that what he had bought for a diamond was only a bit of glass .
however , he had not gone far before he exclaimed , `` byiago , this mule hath the pace of a camel ! '' [male] , not being accustomed to four legs , did not know how to use them . so that he would move his right fore and hind legs together . this caused the archbishop great inconvenience , for , being a corpulent man . it made him roll about on the saddle like the gold ball on the cathedral of sevilla .
he had been both hungry and thirsty when he came into the cave . as he had not waited to have his midday meal with the other field workers . but now he felt quite comforted and refreshed , he sat there some time longer . and noticed that as the old men frowned over the chessboard , their beards grew longer and longer . until they swept the floor of the cave .
as he descended , the daylight in which hitherto he had been travelling faded from view . as he descended , the daylight in which hitherto he had been travelling faded from view . and he passed within a few minutes from sunset into an obscurity so dense that he could no longer distinguish the nature of his environment . till , as the horse alighted , he perceived beneath him a smooth expanse ending abruptly on all sides at an apparent elevation among the objects surrounding it . dismounting he found himself on the roof of a large palace .
but there came an evening when he was seen joyously hastening down the river bank in response to the voice of the lorelei . that surely never had sounded so honey sweet before , and he came back nevermore , they said that the lorelei had dragged him down to her [male] caves that he might live with her there forever . and , if it were not so , the rushing water could never whisper her secret and theirs . of a lifeless plaything that they swept seawards . and that wore a look of horror and of great wonder in its dead , wide-open eyes .
he told de lancre , not without pride , that he had been a wer wolf . but that he had given up the practice , when he first arrived at the monastery he had preferred to go on all fours . eating such food as he found on the ground . he confessed that he still craved for raw human flesh . especially the flesh of little girls , and he hoped it would not be long before he had another opportunity of tasting it .
so that whether he happened to be cross or amiable , splendidly or simply attired . serious or frivolous , he was always perfectly irresistible , in truth , he was a charming young fellow . since the fairy had given him the best heart in the world as well as the best head . and had left nothing to be desired but -- constancy , for it can not be denied that prince [male] was a desperate flirt . and as fickle as the wind ; so much so , that by the time he arrived at his eighteenth birthday there was not a heart left for him to conquer in his father 's kingdom .
he answered not a word , being resolved to cheat her . as he had done before , he went to find out little day . and saw him with a little foil in his hand . with which he was fencing with a great monkey ; the child being then only three years of age . he took him up in his arms .
but amongst the immortals there was also a mother with children whom she counted as peerless . [female] , mother of [female] and [female] . was magnificently certain that in all time , nor in eternity to come , could there be a son and daughter so perfect in beauty . in wisdom , and in power as the two that were her own , loudly did she proclaim her proud belief . and when [female] heard it she laughed in scorn .
now there dwelt in the forest an old cowherd , who happened that morning to have work to do not far from the pit where [male] lived with the wolf . he took with him a big dog . which helped him to collect the cows when they wandered . and to keep off any strange beasts that threatened to attack them , on this particular morning there were no cows . so the dog ran hither and thither as he would , enjoying himself mightily .
i pass over many other things peculiar to this island . lest i should be troublesome to you , here i exchanged some of my diamonds for merchandize . from hence we went to other islands . and at last , having touched at several trading towns of the continent , we landed at [person] . from whence i proceeded to bagdad , there i immediately gave large presents to the poor .
again he divided his men and bent his flight towards the shore of loch ness . but still he saw the foe bearing down upon him with redoubled vigour . becoming fearfully alive to his position , he cried to his few remaining companions again to disperse . until they left him , one by one , and he was alone . [male] , who as a mark of superiority and as captain of the [male] macdonells .
when [female] had finished his story , he ordered one hundred sequins to be given to [male] . who retired with the other guests ; but next morning the same company returned to dine with rich [male] . who , after having treated them as formerly , requested their attention , and gave the following account of his sixth voyage . gentlemen , you long without doubt to know . how , after having been shipwrecked five times , and escaped so many dangers , i could resolve again to tempt fortune .
some of you , my little friends , have probably heard that this [female] was a [male] steed . with beautiful silvery wings , who spent most of his time on the summit of mount helicon . he was as wild , and as swift , and as buoyant . in his flight through the air , as any eagle that ever soared into the clouds . there was nothing else like him in the world .
this unexpected information threw him into a great rage . in the midst of which his eye caught sight of one of the letters [male] had taken from the post office . this was addressed to mr. [male] , and as it bore the [location] postmark . mr. [male] yielded to the temptation of making the letter gape at its extremities . this was before the days of the envelope -- and so read its contents .
the air was soft with the coming of spring ; the sun was shining . the songs of the birds were full of gratitude and joy . the most lovely flowers , in all imaginable hues , turned the earth into a jewelled nest of verdure . [female] threw herself down on a bank . bright with green moss and soft as a downy pillow .
birds of all kinds , except cassowaries . are killed with bows and arrows , there is also a method of killing certain kinds of birds of paradise which dance on branches of trees . and certain other kinds and bower birds , which dance on the ground . by means of nooses as above described . these being tied to the branch of the tree , or , in the case of ground nooses .
there was much murmuring at this , and while the brothers were disputing the king 's decision . a charming sound was heard of trumpets and other musical instruments . it was the youngest prince who arrived in a chariot with out riders and numerous attendants . all of which had been provided for him by the white cat , after respectfully greeting his father and embracing his brothers . he took out of a jewelled box a nut which he broke .
but he was paying the penalty laid on his father 's crime . for one time , cutting trees alone among the hills . he spurned the prayer of the hamadryas nymph . who , weeping sore , with earnest words besought him not to cut the trunk of an oak tree . which , with herself coeval , had endured for many a year .
as they went home , a great cricket flew from under the kitten 's feet and frightened her again . for she was hardly awake , away she sprang to catch it . and away sprang the cricket , while violet had to run fast to keep up with them . laughing to see how puzzled [female] would be when the cricket hid under the long grass . and while she was pawing , and purring , and looking up to violet as if she would ask .
paintings may be paneled on the walls , if one has only one suitable picture for the room it should be placed over the mantel . or in some other position of importance , making a centre of interest in the room . using pictures and pieces of tapestry in this way is quite different from having the walls painted in two sharply contrasting colors . because the paint gives the feeling of permanence while the picture is obviously an added decoration requiring a correct background . i am speaking of the average house , not of houses and palaces where the walls have been painted by great artists .
now [female] heard that his own home had been burnt to the ground . it was a great grief to him . almost making him break out in a rage against providence . his breast heaved with anger , he bade his men await him on the mountain side . they were to see which of the two would come alive out of the tussle .
when this message was told to sir [male] , the tears stood in his eyes and he went apart . and for that day the knights his comrades held their counsel . but they resolved that next day they would prevail upon sir [male] to issue forth and give battle . but in the morning , when they looked from the walls of the castle . they saw that sir [male] had crept up in the dawn .
`` fair , sweet friend , '' said the queen , `` give me back my child . '' the fairy made no reply , but dived into the water . and the queen was taken to an abbey , where she was known as the queen of great griefs . the lady of the lake took the child to her own home . which was an island in the middle of the sea and surrounded by impassable walls .
things had been going on like this for about three months , when one fine morning another telegram boy came with another telegram to say that somebody who owed the merchant a great deal of money was ready to pay the debt . and all the merchant had to do was to go to the city and get it . of course , everybody was delighted at this good news . and the merchant did not waste any time , but started off to the city at once . `` mind you bring me something back , ''
tans should never come too close to brown for a dark room , for nothing is more dreary or hopeless than a room done in that depressing color . the beautiful tones of old oak , or properly treated modern oak paneling . are quite a different matter , small amounts of red or orange will do wonders . if used with discretion , in brightening a dull room , and are often just what are needed to bring out the beauty of the rest of the scheme . but it is a great mistake to think that red walls and a great deal of red in the hangings and furniture covering will make a cheerful or pleasant room .
it left me through life under pain . after i left almhuin of leinster . there was not a residence where the fianna had been , but i searched accurately without any delay . on my passing through the glen of the thrushes i saw a great assembly there . three hundred men and more were before me in the glen .
in a short time the prince and princess made their appearance at the window . and requested to be taken down , when the giant had deposited them safely on the ground . they embraced each other , and then [male] ; and , turning to [male] . they made him a very pretty speech . expressive of gratitude and eternal remembrance .
all this time the princess had been watching the combat from the roof of the palace . no sooner did prince [male] schah hear those words than he checked his steed in its flight . and swooping low he bore down over the palace roof . and catching the princess up in his arms placed her upon the saddle before him . and straightway at the pressure of its rider the horse rose under them and carried them away high in air .
a farmer was greatly annoyed by a fox , which came prowling about his yard at night and carried off his fowls . so he set a trap for him and caught him . and in order to be revenged upon him , he tied a bunch of tow to his tail and set fire to it and let him go . as ill luck would have it , however , the fox made straight for the fields where the corn was standing ripe and ready for cutting . it quickly caught fire and was all burnt up .
sir [male] did as his brother bade him . and sir [male] hastened with all speed to the duke 's palace . he was only just in time , the hour for the fight had come . and the steward had entered the lists , and , looking round in triumph . proclaimed to all whom it might concern that his adversary knew himself to be a traitor to his lord .
therewith he lifted the horn and blew so great a blast that instantly knights came in a great press from the tents . and people looked out from the walls and windows of the castle . then [male] saw a tall man come running from a tent . arming himself as he came , two barons set his spurs upon his heels and an [male] buckled his helm upon his head . he was all in red armour , from the plume which waved upon his crest to the cloth which was upon his horse .
so [female] home for dear life and fetched a spade . and then back as hard as he could go to the field , but when he got there . lo , and behold , not a ragweed in the whole field but had a red garter . just like his own , tied to it , and as for digging up that whole field . it was out of the question , for there were more than forty good irish acres in it .
at the same moment there entered the hall a servant of [male] . and loudly did he proclaim that the girl babe , who had been foretold , was born . `` right beautiful and strong is the child , most fair to look upon , '' and because of the words that the king [male] had spoken . the life of the babe was spared , and when the days of feasting were past . [male] returned to his palace , and with him he took the infant child and her mother .
past this castle went [male] and his foster parents . they had told him its story during the long winter evenings . and now he saw the lordly castle , with its double moat , and trees , and bushes . the wall , covered with ferns , rose within the moat . but most beautiful of all were the lofty lime trees , which grew up to the highest windows .
they are wicked people only who can never obtain a glimpse of fairies . some of them were not taller than the breadth of a finger . and they wore golden combs in their long , yellow hair . they were rocking themselves two together on the large dew drops with which the leaves and the high grass were sprinkled . sometimes the dew drops would roll away , and then they fell down between the stems of the long grass .
[male] had spent many a happy year here without ever thinking of the upper world . or of those he had left behind , so pleasantly passed the time -- so many an agreeable play fellow he had among the children . of all his playfellows there was none of whom he was so fond as of a little fair haired girl , named [female] . she was from his own village , and was the daughter of [female] . the minister of rambin , she was but four years old when she was taken away .
[female] let [female] cow take care of herself and hurried after [female] . wondering what the fairy had done to [male] , but it seemed that [male] had brought on his trouble himself by trying to save the wood that morning when [male] told him she needed more wood for the fire . instead of giving her more wood he had poured on some oil and the flame had blazed up and burnt him . when [male] and [male] reached the farmhouse [male] was on the floor . groaning with pain , forgetting all the unkindness they had received at his hands .
`` where is it going ? '' said [male] of the goatskin . `` does it go on like that in the night as well as in the day ? '' he ran by its side and shouted to the river . he saw a wide winged bird flying across it . it was the bird that we call the crane or the heron .
then she went to the henwife 's house . the old woman put on the cloak of darkness . got everything for her she had the first sunday at church . and put her on the white mare in the same fashion . then [female] rode along the highway to the front of the house .
what power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes ! the young man felt the truth of the proverb . `` still waters run deep : '' and his heart had sunk into their depths . he often talked of his adventures , and the mamma was as simple and eager in her questions as on the first evening they met . it was a pleasure to hear [male] describe anything .
a little farther on , but close at hand , is a cloister with beautiful marble columns and tombs . and a colossal wood carved calvary , and beside that a small and very rich chapel . indeed , so full is the little town of the undisturbed past , that to walk in it is like opening a missal of the middle ages . all emblazoned and illuminated with saints and warriors , and it is so clean . and so still , and so noble , by reason of its monuments and its historic colour .
in time , hundreds of others learned how to traffic among the tribes and swap . or barter their goods , for as yet there were no coins for money . or bank bills , so they established markets or fairs . to which the girls and boys liked to go and sell their eggs and chickens . for when the wolves and foxes were killed off , sheep and geese multiplied .
when they had heard these sad news , they all began to lament heavily . his wife made a pitiful outcry , beat her face . and tore her hairs , the children , being all in tears . made the house resound with their groans . and the father , not being able to overcome nature , mixed his tears with theirs .
now the wind demon had been awaiting this chance all along , he feared the famous prince . and durst not snatch his wife from his arms ; but as soon as ever the king 's son had put his foot out of doors . the wind demon came in and vanished with the wife of the king 's son . not very long afterwards the king 's son came back , and could find his wife nowhere . he went to the [female] to seek her .
ye song of ye foolish old woman . this is an illustrated poem , with the top half being an old woman going up then down a hill . the bottom is the poem , with court jesters on either side . left side titled hope in adversity . right titled fear in prosperity , i saw an old woman go up a steep hill .
when she questioned them all , the [organization] was not there . but it came soon afterwards , and when asked , it said that it had just come from farmer [female] 's . then the old woman said that it was to guide the man to him . but the [organization] would have something to eat first , and then it wanted to wait until the next day . for it was so tired with the long journey that it was scarcely able to rise from the earth .
many of the things the king saw showed plainly the mingled sentiments of the people . for instance , he would one day visit a great smith 's shop . where heavy masses of iron were being forged , the whole place resounding with tremendous blows from heavy hammers . and the clank and din of iron on the anvils . while the next day he would find the place transformed into a studio .
but whilst they were getting all ready , they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance . which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack . and swung him up by a cord to the tree . where they left him dangling , and ran away , meantime he worked and worked away . till he made a hole large enough to put out his head .
[person] could not name the colours of the little ladies dresses , which were of all the hues of summer blossoms . the vain little things had powdered their hair , and decked their heads with ribbons . feathers , and flowers , their shoes were of velvet and satin . and were high heeled and pointed , and such sparkling black eyes as all the little ladies had .
with this she took the pot from the fire . put on her bonnet , and they went out together . as they passed the children , they stopped to play with them a while . for they now felt almost like children themselves . then they trudged on through the snow till they came to a clump of trees .
although the stranger 's name and rank were unknown to [male] 's father . he was really the son of the king of the golden isle . which had for capital a city that extended from one sea to another . the walls , washed by the quiet waters , were covered with gold . which made one think of the yellow sands , above them was a rampart of orange and lemon trees .
i soon found out what monsters in the shape of men , however . certain churls , men of no character . no elevation , no refinement , -- forgive me . i am not quite myself ; these men , if i may call them men . to whom i owed , i believe , some trifling sums of no account .
[female] , what a noise she made as she came down the chimney in a cloud of blue smoke ! if she had not been quite so cross she would have arrived through the window in her best chariot drawn by sea gulls . but she was determined to take as little trouble as possible over the matter . and no one could take less trouble over anything than to come straight down the chimney , `` oh ! '' said every one with a little scream ; and the prince was so startled that he cut an extremely crooked slice of cake .
when there would be a moment 's pause , and then the round of melody went on again . the fairies within [person] , for the song was a fairy melody . when they heard this addition to the tune . were so much delighted that , with instant resolve , it was determined to bring the mortal among them . whose musical skill so far exceeded theirs , and little [person] was conveyed into their company with the eddying speed of a [person] .
the duck came to them , and [male] seated himself on its back . and told his sister to sit by him , `` no , '' replied [male] . that will be too heavy for the little duck ; she shall take [location] across . one after the other , the good little duck did so , and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time . the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them , and at length they saw from afar their father 's house .
one evening , after sunset , there came a strange man to the ferry of sund . he engaged all the ferry boats there to go backwards and forwards the whole night long between that place and vendsyssel . without the people 's knowing what lading they had , he told them that they should take their freight on board half a mile to the east of sund . near the alehouse at the bridge of lange . when morning was breaking they received the payment they had agreed for .
the king of [male] himself put up a tent on the green in front of the castle . and prepared everything necessary to eat and drink ( there was no one else to do it ) . after breakfast next day , [male] and lug began fighting again . the king of [male] looked on as the day before . they fought the whole day till near evening .
but [female] replied as before , that if the queen wished to have them she must let her spend the night at the door of the chamber . then the queen said to herself , what can i lose by satisfying this silly girl . in order to get from her these beautiful things ? so taking all the treasures which [female] offered her . as soon as night appeared , the instrument for the debt contracted with sleep and repose being liquidated . she gave the sleeping draught to [male] ; but this time he did not swallow it .
a good man had a beautiful wife , whom he loved passionately . and never left if possible , one day , when he was obliged by important business to go away from her . he went to a place where all kinds of birds are sold and bought a parrot . this parrot not only spoke well , but it had the gift of telling all that had been done before it . he brought it home in a cage .
it seemed for an instant that the prince was really hopeful . then again his dark mood returned -- the mood of one who believes he is lost . yet nevertheless he put forth his hand to everychild and said , `` yes , i will go with you . '' he approached the window with slow , majestic tread . once he shrank back and lifted his hands to his eyes .
at last the day came for the naming of their new found child . so the old couple called in a celebrated name giver , and he gave her the name of princess moonlight . because her body gave forth so much soft bright light that she might have been a daughter of the moon god . for three days the festival was kept up with song and dance and music . all the friends and relations of the old couple were present .
`` i wish to go home , '' said [male] . hanging down his head and speaking in a low voice . for his heart was heavy because of his failure , `` that is well , '' answered the bird . she took [female] on her back . and in three minutes they were floating among the clouds .
upon this the sheikh exclaimed : `` god is most great , '' and the people made the same exclamation with him . rejoicing at the event , the emeer moosa also rejoiced at the safety of [male] . and at the opening of the gate of the city . the people thanked him for that which he had done . and all the troops hastened to enter the gate , but the emeer moosa cried out to them .
she was waited upon by her twelve companions . who were almost as charming as their [female] , to whom they were devotedly attached . rumours of the loveliness of princess [female] spread far and wide . people came to see her from all parts of the world . so that it was soon no longer a desert island .
and yet both greeks and romans represented truth under the guise of a woman . once upon a time there was a country , more beautiful than all other lands and the castle of the duke . its ruler , lay beside a lake that was bluer than the deepest indigo . a long time ago the knight [male] and his squire [male] chanced upon this lake . but they found nothing save waste fields and bleak rocks around it .
now the king came home , and he had defeated the other king . against whom he had warred ; and the whole castle was overjoyed , and none was more joyful than the king 's daughter . but the queen pretended to be ill , and gave the physician a great deal of money so that he should say that she could not recover unless she had some of the blue bull 's flesh to eat . the king 's daughter and others as well asked the physician whether nothing else would do . and pleaded for the bull ; for all liked him , and said that there was not such another in the whole kingdom .
`` see , yonder is a sea gull , '' cried the children . when they saw the white bird , as it dived into the sea . and rose again into the clear sunlight , white and glittering , but no one could tell whither it went then although some declared it flew straight to the sun . there was once a regular student , who lived in a garret , and had no possessions . and there was also a regular huckster , to whom the house belonged , and who occupied the ground floor .
the fairy of the fields did not wait to hear more , no time was to be lost in seeking the help of the fairy queen if [male] and his family were to be saved from this dreadful doom . so , without waiting to summon her lizard , she flew across the island and past the dragons till her feet once more touched the ground again . but at that instant a black cloud rolled over her , loud thunder rent the air . and the earth rocked beneath her , then wild lightnings lit up the sky . and by their flashes she saw the four and twenty dragons fighting together .
it was a calm and clear night . the wild geese did not trouble themselves to seek shelter in any of the grottoes . but stood and slept upon the mountain top ; and the boy had lain down in the short . dry grass beside the geese , if there had been any witches out that night . he should have seen them , to be sure , it was so light in the heavens that not the tiniest black speck could move in the air without his seeing it .
then he strode on toward the palace of [male] . while all the people wondered at his bearing , [male] came out wondering . and `` who are you , bold youth ? '' he cried . [male] sat awhile , sad and silent ; for he had often heard of that golden fleece . but he looked on it as a thing hopeless and impossible for any mortal man to win it .
but trivial things , invented and pursued for bread , become very serious matters of fact . and , apart from this consideration , i am not at all prepared to say . myself , that if [male] had been a lord chamberlain . or a member of parliament , or a lawyer . or even a great speculator , he would have dealt in toys one whit less whimsical .
then , in their ship , that the warden of the coast once had challenged . [male] and his warriors set sail for their own dear land . `` the must be often helps an undoomed man when he is brave '' was the precept on which he ruled his life . and he never failed the king whose chief champion and warrior he was . when , in an expedition against the frieslanders , king [male] fell a victim to the cunning of his foes .
spin , wheel , spin ; sing . wheel , sing ; every stone in my yard . spin , spin , spin ; the thread is hers . the wool is mine ; twelve drops from her heart will make my leaves shine ! how little she knows , the foolish thing , that my name is [organization] and curr and carr .
the gray king died in his hour , then we crowned you . the prophetess wise : peace of the heart we deeply adored for the witchcraft hid in your eyes . gift from the sky , overmastering all , you sent forth your magical parrots to call the plot hatching prince of the tigers . to your throne by the red clay wall . thus came that genius insane : spitting and slinking .
as to the green fairy , he came down in a spider web . when he got out and stood on the grass , he said . `` i shall not go back to that giant , he is good , but he is too violent . '' so he went to the river and got a nice chip . and he loaded it with honeysuckles and clover blossoms .
everychild was considering this when he heard a voice behind him . and turning his head , he was surprised to perceive that the masked lady was standing there . quite close to him , and that mr. [male] was only a step or two distant . mr. [male] held his note book before him . and he had just lifted his hand with a flourish .
all went on mighty well until , by dad , the goose got stricken in years like her master . and could not divert him no longer , and then it was that the poor king was lost entirely . the king was walkin one mornin by the edge of the lake , lamentin his cruel fate , and thinking of drowning himself . that could get no diversion in life , when all of a sudden , turning round the corner .
the chief brahman came along with a smile on his face . and a big sword in his hand , when , suddenly , he noticed that the bâdshah 's finger was tied up in a bit of rag . instantly he dropped the sword , and , with his eyes starting out of his head with excitement . pounced upon the rag and tore it off , and there he saw that the tip of his victim 's finger was missing . at this he got very red and angry indeed , and he led the bâdshah up to where the rajah sat wondering .
there was a gun hanging on the wall , he took it down . and moved toward the stranger 's room , he put his hand to the door . when suddenly the struggling fire burst into a glow of light . and the cricket on the hearth began to chirp , no sound he could have heard . no human voice , not even hers , could so have moved and softened him .
he took this delay so much to heart . that he could neither eat nor sleep ; meantime [female] was little better . she did nothing but look at the prince 's portrait . and was exceedingly irritable with [female] and [female] , her two maids of honour . the other lady -- the black princess -- was in equally sore plight .
three little tailor men jogging along -- along in the [organization] weather . no longer they laugh with a jest and a song but they walk very sadly together . for when maidens are proud like the milkmaidens cold . the lads they grow sad like the tailors so bold . fancy and fact , this is an illustrated poem with the shepherd and shepherdess sitting in the grass above the poem .
meanwhile [female] and [female] had hunted the livelong day . and , being tired , they had placed their game on the ground . and sat down to rest under a tree , where they fell asleep , the king 's son also hunted that day in the forest . he missed his suite , and came to the place where our young shepherd and shepherdess were reposing . he contemplated them for some time with wonder .
the grand vizier was almost struck dumb at this demand . however , he recovered himself , and said , my lord . be not surprised at the confusion i was under upon your question . is it possible , think you , my lord . that any lady , or any other person in the world .
in this book mr. [male] inclines to the view that the stories as first published by [male] were not really written by him . but by his little son of ten or eleven , to whom [male] told the stories as he had gathered them up with the intention of rendering them in verse after the manner of la [male] . the lad had an excellent memory , much natural wit . and a great gift of expression , he loved the stories his father told him and thoroughly enjoyed the task his father set him of rewriting them from memory . as an exercise , this was so happily done , in such a fresh , artless , and engaging style .
the old man set the ship on the ground . and at once it began to grow , it grew and grew and grew , until it was so large that it could have carried a score of men if need be . and so it was , [male] stepped into the ship and sailed away until he came to the king 's palace . and when the king saw the ship he was so delighted with it that he was quite willing to give the princess to the simpleton for a bride . the marriage was held with much feasting and rejoicing .
many of the mountain mulgars , however , who eat always sitting on the ground , soon found this perching on stools at a table irksome for their pleasure . and squatted themselves down in the thick grasses for [male] 's supper . and they feasted on fruits they never before had tasted nor knew to grow on earth . one , rosy and red and round and small , with a long , slender stalk and a little pale hard stone . of the colour of amber , in the middle .
that he was a simpleton was evident ; his head was small and his limbs were large . and he could run long before he could talk or do arithmetic , in the bitterness of their hearts his father and mother named him noodle . without the aid of any royal god parents ; and from that moment . for any care they took in his bringing up . they washed their wise hands of him .
at last a celebrated magician from finland was brought before the king . who had found out that the king 's son in law was imprisoned in the east . not by men , but by some more powerful being , the king now sent messengers to the east to look for his son in law . and they by good luck met with the old magician who had interpreted the signs on king [male] 's ring . and thus was possessed of more wisdom than anyone else in the world .
`` then we must not lose our time , '' said princess [female] . and in a minute she turned into a river . the prince into an iron bridge the steed into a black [male] . and the large road was divided into three smaller roads , swiftly the chase was coming by the fresh tracks . but when they came to the river , they stopped perplexed .
he lit a lantern and went down into the vault beneath the house . there , as the talisman had said , was the red stone built into the wall . he pressed the stone , and it turned upon its pivot as the talisman had said it would turn . within was a hollow space , as the talisman said there would be , in the hollow space there was a casket of silver . the young man snatched it up , and his hands trembled for joy .
`` the king , the king , '' and as the young man heard . a cold shiver , that he knew not the meaning of . ran through him , `` this is fear whom you have so long sought , '' whispered a voice . which seemed to reach his ears alone , and the youth bowed his head as the vision once more flashed before his eyes . and he accepted his doom , and made ready to pass his life with fear beside him .
the peasant bowed to the ground , and returned home with a bottle full of the water of life . he hastened to the grave in the forest . lifted up the body of his daughter , and as soon as he had sprinkled it with the water the girl came to life again . and threw herself into his arms , all who were present were moved to tears . then the peasant started again for the capital , and arriving there went at once to the czar 's palace .
the whole party were sitting round , and the jar of itself was in the middle of the floor . there came a noise and shouting on the street , like as if there was a powerful assembly of people without . and then a great battering on the windows , the door opened wide and the disturbance came into the kitchen . yet no person sitting there seen a heth that was not in it from the start . it was a [female] gathering surely .
and this is the way [female] , [female] , escaped from the wicked giant . the following day [female] , [female] , was trudging along near the edge of a forest . the land was rather low and marshy , and the path was none too dry . he gingerly picked his way , avoiding as well as possible the muddy spots . of a sudden his attention was arrested by a funny sight , a few feet in front of him .
well , the young king was just then coming into the big [male] from hunting . and as soon as he entered the house , she beckoned to him . shed a few crocodile tears , began to cry and wring her hands . and hurried him along the passage to the bedchamber . oh , was not the poor king frightened when he saw the queen 's mouth bloody .
he spent the day among the hills with fair success . and was turning towards home , when endeavouring to recover a bird he had shot . he scrambled on to a small grass covered platform in front of a natural cave in the rock . and much was his astonishment to see his lost goat standing at the entrance of the cave . he called her , and held out his hand .
but when he heard the king 's command . he dried his eyes and bade them bring shears to cut him loose . for his hair had bound him a fast prisoner . and he could not move , and then he sent them for rich clothes . and jewels , which he put on ; and he ordered them to saddle the white horse .
the men raised the enormous stone with an effort . now and then indeed one of their number would sigh , as he remembered that they were destroying the work of their former beloved [male] . but the labor was far lighter than they had imagined , it seemed as if a power within the spring itself were aiding them in raising the stone . [female] screamed out that the knight was to be called , but none of her maids ventured from the spot . and even the bride herself became mute , as if [female] at her own voice .
punchinello traveled around the world in company with a circus . whenever this circus reached a city , it formed a great parade before it entered . then would the people throng the streets and highways . eager for the show , they clapped their hands when lions roaring in their cages and elephants led by their keepers passed along . but when this famous [person] , prancing and twirling , came in view .
curiosity , however , caused her to forget her father 's instructions and she put her head out to look at the far distant ocean . white with storm , as she did so the wind caught her long red hair and she was blown down the mountain side which was covered with ice and snow . so that she slid to the dark belt of firs below the snow rim . this district belonged to the [female] bears . they were not really beasts then , but lived in caves , walked on two legs .
as soon as the crocodile landed him , the happy hunter hastened to tell the skillful fisher of his safe return . he then gave him back the fishing [male] which had been found in the mouth of the [male] and which had been the cause of so much trouble between them . he earnestly begged his brother 's forgiveness . telling him all that had happened to him in the sea king 's palace and what wonderful adventures had led to the finding of the [male] . now the skillful fisher had used the lost [male] as an excuse for driving his brother out of the country .
the king at length appeared himself . he had a whiting 's head . like many of the others ; but he had fins on his shoulders . and from his waist downwards he was a veritable whiting . he could speak , and wore only a scarf made of the skin of goldfish .
at a word from [male] , [male] and [male] took the basket from the porter . who was glad enough to be relieved from its weight ; and when it was emptied . paid him handsomely for its use , but instead of taking up his basket and going away . the man still lingered , till [male] inquired what he was waiting for . and if he expected more money , `` oh , madam , '' returned he .
they welcomed them , held out their hands to them . and led them in , careful and [female] just saw them pass by the window . and saw where they were placed at the table , the first place of all was given to old [male] . and beside him sat [male] , where all rosy , the golden youth . drinks welcome to his guests from a goblet of gold .
defending lady mason in orley farm , to him it was a matter of course that lady mason should be guilty . had she not been guilty , he , mr. [male] would not have been required . mr. [male] well understood that the defence of injured innocence was no part of his mission . mr. [male] , in the [male] diamonds . is a bird dog determined to solve the mystery of the diamonds .
no woman can possess any property , other than movable property . and even this is at best confined to the clothes and ornaments which she wears . on the death of a married woman all her effects go to her husband . or , if he be dead , they go to her children or descendants . male and female , equally , if she has no children or descendants .
in the forest by the river gudenau . not far from the heath , and beneath the ridge of land . stood the little farm , newly painted and whitewashed , the air was heavy and dark . there were no blossoms on the heath ; the autumn winds whirled the yellow leaves towards the boatman 's hut . in which strangers dwelt ; but the little farm stood safely sheltered beneath the tall trees and the high ridge .
now when the people in the town and palace heard music coming from the tower they were filled with amazement . and came to the king with the news that witchcraft must be going on in [male] 's tower . for , instead of dying of starvation , he was seemingly making merry to the sound of music . and to the clatter of plates , and glass . and knives and forks ; and the music was so enchantingly sweet that all the passers-by stood still to listen to it .
they had been nearly ruined by the storm , and were besides old and worn . now he saw a wholly new suit in their place . he began to think he must be in the palace of some fairy . and he was sure of it when he looked out of the window . the snow had gone , and a lovely garden lay before him .
when the king was dead , all the city was dismayed , and wist not who might be their king . right so as they were in counsel , there came a voice among them . and bade them choose the youngest knight of them there to be their king . for he should well maintain them and all theirs . so they made [male] king by all the assent of the whole city .
thus was his guilty love turned to hate , now that death was staring him in the face . [male] made no reply , she threw herself on the deck . and abandoned herself to her feeling of bitter [female] . and as she lay there , and [female] stood at the helm . the wind abated ; the vessel was no longer borne down as before , although the waves were still mountains high .
as he stood musing on this fairy spectacle . a strange noise came to his ear from a distance . at first it seemed like a human voice , following the sound . he reached the shore of a lake . floating at a distance upon its waters sat a most beautiful red [male] .
said [male] , full well knowing that his couch was so placed that he could not fail to see the vandals when he woke . well pleased with his own astuteness , he then retired to rest , and soon sleep lay heavy on his eyelids . but , while he slept , [male] gently moved the couch upon which he lay . so that he must open his eyes not on the army who had won his favour . but on the army that owned hers , to the winilers .
what was he to do ? if he refused to let [male] help the prince . the people might begin to suspect him , and start a revolution which would thrust him from his throne . if he allowed [male] to cure the prince . the prince would certainly demand the kingdom on his twenty first birthday . what was he to do with [male] , whose right to the throne was superior even to his nephew 's ?
it was in this mine that he grew and made his first experiments in walking . later on he began to explore , first the narrow passage where his mother worked at her daily task . then venturing into the other galleries of this subterranean kingdom , as his mind developed . a whole world of phantoms created by his imagination rose around him . all these masses of black earth with their blocks of metal .
now she saw that she could not in any way change his resolve . she told her nurse to bring a certain casket which contained . she said , something exhilarating which would help the prince on his journey . the box was brought , and she divided off a portion of what was within and gave it to the prince to eat . then , and while he was all unaware , she put forth her hand to a stick fashioned like a snake .
the duke 's face did not move ; but he looked at his petitioner with a glassy stare which was the most awful expression i have ever seen on a human face . i could see the librarian 's great legs wavering under him like the shadows of stems in a pool . and i could not banish from my own brain the fancy that the trees all around [location] were filling softly in the silence with devils instead of birds . i suppose i can be prosecuted for assault . but i am very glad i did it , when he said .
when they had gone through these rooms , the sister led her brother into a chamber where a [female] sat before a golden embroidery frame . working with golden threads , from this room she led him into another . where a second [male] was spinning gold thread . and at last into a room where a third [female] was stringing pearls . while at her feet a golden hen , with a brood of chickens .
he had been away a good many days , but the boys in the street were still on the watch for him . he told them how he had saved the city from the earth quake . and they beat him from the city gate to his father 's door . he told his own father how he had saved the city . and his father beat him from his own door to the city gate .
the prince next dragged the headless bodies into a chamber in the cave . and locked the door , then he and his mother ransacked the place for some food . and when they had eaten it they lay down and slept in peace . with the dawn they were both awake again . and found that , instead of the cave which they had come to the night before .
[male] : i am glad of that . there were moments when i feared it would not be so . [male] : i too , for how could it be otherwise . seeing that he was a shepherd and she a lord 's daughter ? [female] : and when it was related how she was to wed the rough master of coates .
shortly afterwards the ninety devils came home , and they also smelt the smell of man . and took the pieces of man 's flesh out of their teeth . in the middle of their meal their mother asked them how they would treat a human brother if they had one . when they had sworn upon eggs that they would not hurt so much as his little finger . their mother gave the broom a tap .
and in his heart lord [male] made a good resolve . he would put away from him all his worldly possessions . all the money that he had won at the clubs . fairly or foully , all that hideous accretion of gold guineas . he would distribute among the comrades he had impoverished .
the bust was cast in bronze , and part of the metal used for this purpose was the old church [organization] . whose tones had died away from the memory of those at home and elsewhere . the metal , glowing with heat , flowed into the mould . and formed the head and bust of the statue which was unveiled in the square in front of the old castle . the statue represented in living , breathing reality .
on the third and last day of the tournament many valiant deeds were done . not without great hurt and damage to many that contended in the field . there might be seen that day full many a shivered shield , and swords strewn upon the ground . horses also running loose without their riders , and squires helping their lords who were in evil plight . but , for the most part , the knights of the queen fared the better .
his head was full of the dream he had dreamed . but it did not make him neglect his work . for his work was not to dig stars but to drive old diamond and pick up fares . there are not many people who can think about beautiful things and do common work at the same time . but then there are not many people who have been to the back of the north wind .
i could not hear myself named without some emotion . and looking steadfastly on the captain , i knew him to be the person who . in my second voyage , had left me in the island . where i fell asleep by a brook , and set sail without me . or sending to see for me , but i could not remember him at first .
not long after this , the time came round , and the smith sallied forth . prepared as instructed , sure enough as he approached the hill , there was a light where light was seldom seen before . soon after , a sound of [male] , dancing , and joyous merriment reached the anxious father on the night wind . overcoming every impulse to fear , the smith approached the threshold steadily , stuck the [male] into it as directed , and entered . protected by the bible he carried on his breast .
so they agreed to travel together , and soon set off , the count leaving word for his servants to follow and overtake him later . then the count told him about his coming wedding with a young lady he had never seen . but who was said to be very lovely , in this way they entered one of the loneliest and most thickly wooded passes in the mountains . all this happened in the days when bands of robbers lived in woods . and when ghosts were said to haunt old castles , as the count turned to speak to his companion .
one night , while she lay in her pretty bed . a large , ugly , wet toad crept through a broken pane of glass in the window . and leaped right up on the table where tiny lay sleeping under her rose leaf quilt . `` what a pretty little wife this would make for my son , '' said the toad . and she took up the walnut shell in which little tiny lay asleep .
after a time the brother in law of king [male] gave his daughter with great pomp to a brahman . the son of the counsellor [male] . and the princess moonlight was invited to her cousin 's wedding and went to her uncle 's house . and master mind went with her in his girl form , when the counsellor 's son saw master mind in his lovely girl form . he was terribly smitten with the arrows of love .
no , no , that would never do , replied his mother , she has never been tethered . and would not stand it , the best thing for you to do will be to follow her tomorrow . and see where she goes. to this proposal [female] agreed . and early next morning started off after the [female] goat . who soon separated herself from the rest of the herd .
at last , as the birds flew right over the vessel , the surprised onlookers saw that floating beneath their wings was a wonderful chair . all white and gold , more dazzling even than the one they had dreamed the emperor himself sat in on the dragon throne . around each [male] neck was fastened a long streamer of pure gold . and these silken ribbons were tied to the chair in such a manner as to hold it floating wherever its light winged coursers chose to fly . down , down , over the magic vessel came the empty chair , and as it descended .
when they had recovered , the first thing [female] did was to look about . and not seeing [female] thaher , she asked . with eagerness , where he was ? he had withdrawn out of respect whilst her women were engaged in recovering her . and dreaded , not without reason , that some disagreeable consequence might follow what he had seen . but as soon as he heard [male] inquire for him .
an old and crafty fishing mulgar will sit happy all day in some smooth hollow . and , having snared perhaps four or five , or even , maybe , as many as nine or twelve fat fishes . home he goes to his leaf thatched huddle or sand hole . and eats and eats till he can eat no more . after which his wife and children squat round and feed on what remains .
presently both would fly together towards the house , one settling on the sweetbrier . and one on the roof , and then on the chimney , and then [person] along the porch . and then back both would go to have another talk in the plum tree . and then fly off to find their brothers and sisters in the wood . but sure as another morning came , back would come the birds too , looking with their little bright eyes all about the cottage .
so they landed in spite of sir [male] and all his power . and they put him aback . so that he fled and all his people , when this battle was done . king [male] let bury his dead , and then was the noble knight sir [male] found in a great boat lying more than half dead . when sir [male] wist that sir [male] was laid so low .
in the miniatures of that time we find [female] the good . count of flanders , who died in 1127 , represented with a cap with a point at the top . to which a long streamer is attached , and a peak turned up in front . a cap very similar , but without the streamer , and with the point turned towards the left . is to be seen in a portrait of [female] le bel .
as we walked about , we saw a large tall tree upon which we designed to pass the following night . for our security ; and having satisfied our hunger with fruit . we mounted it according , shortly after , the serpent came hissing to the foot of the tree . raised himself up against the trunk of it . and meeting with my comrade , who sat lower than i , swallowed him at once .
then his father bowed his head in shame that his own child should teach him wisdom . of course [male] wore glasses upon his eyes . all wise people wear them , -- and his face was ever grave and solemn . while he walked slowly and stiffly so that people might know he was the celebrated wise man . and do him reverence , and when he had grown to manhood the fame of his wisdom spread all over the world .
so , you see , we shall be right in picturing this invisible air all around [location] as a mixture of two gases . but when we examine ordinary air very carefully , we find small quantities of other gases in it . besides oxygen and nitrogen , first , there is carbonic acid gas . this is the bad gas which we give out of our mouths after we have burnt up the oxygen with the carbon of our bodies inside our lungs . and this carbonic acid is also given out from everything that burns .
when the procession approached the church , it was met by one hundred young maidens . dressed in white , singing to a band of the most skilful musicians : and when the company alighted . the young maidens strewed flowers for them to walk upon . when the ceremony was over , they returned in the same manner . and were treated with the same complimentary services : that the hearts of all might rejoice .
he dreamed of fair green fields and meadows . of silent lakes bordered with rushes , out of which sprang wild fowl slowly flapping their broad wings . of forests thick and dark , where on fallen trees the green moss had grown in velvet softness . of mountains lifting their purple tops into the fleecy clouds . and of long , shady country roads winding in and out and about the hills .
`` have none , '' laughed the scarecrow , snatching off the silver cord from around his waist . he began skipping rope up and down the hall . the princes , tapping their foreheads significantly , retired , and the scarecrow . throwing his arm around happy [male] , began whispering in his ear . he had a plan himself .
the ropedancer had recovered consciousness , and the kind prelate 's presence was a solace to her . the confession lasted a long time , and the story which she had to confide to the priest must have been as strange as it was interesting . for the abbot listened eagerly and with evident emotion , when he had performed the duties of his office he remained alone for a time . he could not immediately regain a mood in which he cared to rejoin the others . he did not ask for the gentlemen from cologne .
`` pride must suffer pain , '' replied the old lady . oh , how gladly she would have shaken off all this grandeur , and laid aside the heavy wreath ! the red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better . but she could not help herself : so she said . `` farewell , '' and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water .
all these tributary streams flow in one direction -- towards the exhibition . on every entrance the flag of [person] is displayed . around the world 's bazaar wave the flags of all nations . there is a humming and a murmuring from the hall of the machines . from the towers the melody of the chimes is heard .
but the father was no longer there , for the loss of his son had killed him . and on his deathbed he confessed to his people how he had contrived that the old wizard should carry away a peasant 's child instead of the prince . wherefore this punishment had fallen upon him , the prince wept bitterly when he heard this news . for he had loved his father well , and for three days he ate and drank nothing . but on the fourth day he stood in the presence of his people as their new king .
perhaps his success with the ladies gives him self confidence . but the reader grits his teeth as [male] allows himself to be sucked into a foolish quarrel with mr. [male] . and we share madame [organization] 's counsel to him at the end when he is offered office and can not bring himself to accept . his density is more believable than madame [organization] 's wisdom . but here the critic is at odds with the enthusiastic reader who cheers her on .
the company tried to guess whose ghost it might have been . some talked of wood demons and others of mountain sprites . but all was dim uncertainty and mystery , the next morning . however , put an end to guessing , for word came of the death of the young count on his way to the castle . and every one felt sure that the stranger of the night before was indeed his spectre .
as it grew older , the little one learned to recognize the glance of love . and when at last it would open its large dark eyes and look eagerly at the dear papa . and , holding out its tiny hands , crow with all the innocent delight of infancy . he would take the babe in his arms . and all the harsh lines about his mouth softened into smiles .
another day a hindu neighbour came to [male] 's master and asked him to lend him his servant for a day . so [male] went to the hindu 's house and there was told to scrape and spin some hemp . but [male] did not understand the hindu language and when he got the knife to scrape the hemp with . he proceeded to chop it all up into little pieces . when the hindu saw what had happened he was very angry and called in the neighbours .
so he went on with winged feet till he came to the shores of a great lake . with a lovely island in the middle of it . while on the bank of the lake was a canoe of glittering stone . and in the canoe were two shining paddles , once upon a time a great and powerful king married a lovely princess . no couple were ever so happy ; but before their honeymoon was over they were forced to part .
all the jewelers approved of the new bridal head dress , and in time this golden ornament was worn in friesland every day . thus it has come to pass that the frisian helmet , which is the glorified crown of thorns . is , in one form or another , worn even in our day , when [male] 's first child . a boy , was born , the happy parents named him [male] . which is only another word for gild helm , out from this northern region .
little as [person] 's house was , it was neat and comfortable . it was a small room on the ground floor . with a tiny window under the stairway , the furniture could not have been much simpler . a very old chair , a rickety old bed . and a tumble down table , a fireplace full of burning logs was painted on the wall opposite the door .
the most fragrant shrubs and flowers perfumed the air . fountains were playing in every direction ; and alcoves were found in every inviting spot . having passed through these delightful grounds , they reached the castle itself . at the entrance of which they were received by blue beard . and a retinue of servants in the most costly dresses .
he knew he could go wherever he pleased . and so with very little delay he entered a deep forest . it was evening and the wind was sighing in the great trees . a winding road stretched before him like a gray ribbon . soon he came to where a boy sat by the side of the road .
the countryman dreaded a beating from his wife . so he went and invited the nobleman to dinner , meanwhile the good woman took all kinds of food and drink out of the basket . spread the table , and then sat down patiently at the window , laying her hands in her lap . awaiting the arrival of her husband and their guest . the nobleman was astonished at receiving such an invitation and laughed , and would not go home with the man .
at last he stopped at the church the doors of which were opened to him the night before . and went in , here everything was bright , and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right hand . the grave of [male] , and sobbed as if his heart would break . people came and went ; the service went on , but no one noticed the boy except an elderly citizen . who stood still and looked at him for a moment and then went away like the rest .
to understand this you must give all your attention , for it is important and at first not very easy to grasp . you must remember , in the first place , that the air is heavy because it is attracted to the earth . and in the second place , that since air is elastic all the atoms of it are pushing upwards against this gravitation . and so , at any point in air , as for instance the place where the paper now is as i hold it up . i feel no pressure because exactly as much as gravitation is pulling the air down .
foremost among them was a huge , repulsive scaly creature that led the dreadful procession . the guards were so terrified that they all ran away ; but the princess stood in the doorway . as white as death , and with her hands clasped tight together for fear she should scream or faint . and fail to do her part , as they came closer and saw her in the way . all the snakes raised their horrid heads and swayed them to and fro .
but [male] 's father said it would be best to leave [male] at home . for there were packs of wolves in the woods . [male] did not like to leave [male] behind , but when his father said so of course he must do it . he took the strap and tied [male] to the leg of the sofa . then he put his old coat on the floor beside the dog .
so the time slipped by till [male] was almost a man . as they reckoned men in those days . and then his mother the queen died , there was great mourning throughout all the isles . and the boy and his father mourned her bitterly also . but before the new year came the king had married another wife .
and he looked in the mirror , and , seeing his own face . he gave a great cry and woke . and the bright sunlight was streaming into the room , and from the trees of the garden and pleasaunce the birds were singing . and the chamberlain and the high officers of state came in and made obeisance to him . and the pages brought him the robe of tissued gold .
now [male] his father sat and watched on sunium day after day . and strained his old eyes across the sea to see the ship afar . and when he saw the black sail , and not the white one , he gave up [male] for dead . and in his grief he fell into the sea , and died . so it is called the agean to this day .
`` ' '' this oasis is now a pleasant place surrounded by fine lawns and planted with beautiful trees . and i will give you plenty of servants . a cellar full of provisions which will never run out , a library full of books . and all sorts of amusements , you will have everything but human companionship . no stranger must ever enter these gates , for i must guard against any possibility of having a seed stolen .
[female] was a little disappointed that her friends the dwarfs did not come to the wedding . but what could she expect if her mother in law and uncles and aunts and cousins were all asked as well ! could she expect that the dignified mr query would condescend to become an object of general curiosity ? i have heard that the little men called and left their cards some days after the wedding . when [male] and [male] were away on their honeymoon .
so long as she was left to take her own way and do as she would . she gave her parents little trouble . she would play about by herself in the little garden with its few hardy flowers . or amongst the heather where the bees were busy ; or she would wander away amongst the hills . and be nobody knew where , sometimes from morning to night .
the landlady had undertaken to send to the sexton , whose house was near . that he might immediately obtain everything the abbot needed for the dying woman 's viaticum . [female] told the sufferer what an exalted servant of the church was ready to receive her confession and give her the sacrament . then she whispered that she might mention [female] 's burdened soul to the abbot . whatever happened , she could now depart from earth in peace .
the knight and the lady , overjoyed , begged [male] to come to their house to refresh himself after this fight . but [male] , hearing that the giant had a brother who was more cruel and wicked even than himself . would not rest until he had also destroyed him , soon he came in sight of the cavern where the giants lived . there was the other giant sitting on a huge block of timber . with a knotted iron club lying by his side .
very angry , indeed , were the devils , they shook their horns and their shocks of red hair fiercely . and rushed to put on [female] skin trousers to make themselves look more terrible . they then brought out great iron bars and ran to where the pheasant perched over their heads . and tried to knock him down , the pheasant flew to one side to escape the blow . and then attacked the head of first one and then another demon , he flew round and round them .
and they were very provoked , not knowing what to answer for fear it might be on the tip of her neighbor 's tongue . so they said nothing at all , and with one accord tossed their heads and turned their backs on him . and [male] laughed , leaving them to guess why , on which , greatly put out . every girl without even consulting one another they decided to have nothing further to do with him . and each girl went and sat under a different apple tree and began to do her hair .
suddenly the sea troll came shooting up out of the deep with a terrific noise , so that waves and foam spurted to the very skies . this time the monster had six heads and nine dogs . when the [male] saw [male] sitting with the king 's daughter . he fell into a rage and cried : `` what are you doing with my princess ? '' the youth answered : `` it seems to me that she is my princess rather than yours . ''
i have no way to determine how long i slept . i only know that i was rudely awakened by a terrible commotion of the sloop . to my surprise , i found my father sleeping soundly . i cried out lustily to him , and starting up , he sprang quickly to his feet . indeed , had he not instantly clutched the rail , he would certainly have been thrown into the seething waves .
but nothing living appeared ; only before me stretched the rocky , limitless desert . i hoped that i should come to some oasis where i might find palms and a stream of fresh water . but was disappointed , finally , i saw before me a mountain that rose so far into the sky that i could not even discern its top . as i came nearer , i perceived that it was warm . so i concluded that i had now come to the tropical country and that behind this great mountain .
and then [female] tipped a big flat stone over the well . and all the goblins were caught inside like flies in a pitcher . [male] was ever so pleased to have got rid of the goblins , sat down and made sure he would now recollect the truth in good earnest . but he had no luck , because down in the well the goblins began to wriggle and to ramp as never before . through every gap and chink shot up tiny flames which the goblins gave out in their fright and distress .
but no thief or cat was ever half so sharp as this wonderful badger kettle , at last . however , they managed to knock it down and secure it . and , holding it in with their united efforts , they forced it into a box . intending to carry it off and throw it away in some distant place . so that they might be no more plagued by the goblin , for this day their troubles were over .
but when daylight came , they went to sleep , for hobyahs . you know , sleep all day , the little old man was very sorry when he found that the little old woman was gone . he knew then what a good little dog [male] had been to guard the house at night . so he fetched [male] 's tail . and his legs , and his head , and gave them back to him again .
when the children came in the next morning , they placed the tin soldier in the window . now , whether it was the goblin who did it . or the draught , is not known , but the window flew open , and out fell the tin soldier . heels over head , from the third story . into the street beneath , it was a terrible fall .
all the dogs were invited and all the dogs accepted the invitation . there were big dogs and little dogs and middle sized dogs . there were black dogs and white dogs and brown dogs and gray dogs and yellow dogs and spotted dogs . there were dogs with long tails and dogs with short tails and dogs with no tails at all . there were dogs with little sharp pointed ears and dogs with big flat drooping ears .
the princess agreed with all that her father said , and orders were issued for vast numbers of elephants and camels . and gorgeous tents and flags , and litters for the ladies . and horses for the men , to be prepared without delay . as the king and princess were going to pay a visit to the great and munificent prince [male] dad . the merchant , the king declared , was to guide the party .
but this time prince [male] had heard something of what she said in his sleep . and when he woke up he asked his chamberlain what had happened during the night . and he told the prince that for two nights running a [male] had been in his room and sung to him . but he had not answered , next day the princess sought out the master maid as before . and this time she was dressed in a dress of shining gold .
little prince [male] , on the big black horse . heard a noise behind him , he looked back . and there was the huge witch , towering over the trees , she was dressed like a little baby . and her eyes flashed and her teeth clanged as she shut her mouth . she was running with long strides , faster even than the black horse could gallop .
it was true , [female] and [female] might not leave that dwelling until the recompense they had agreed to was paid in full . where now would the asir go for gold ? [male] took off the ring that was engraved with the rune of power . and he put it on the lip hair of the otter 's skin . then [male] clapped his hands and screamed aloud . huge [male] and lean and hungry looking [male] came within , and [male] came behind them .
at last they quietened down for [female] to tell them just one more story before they were tucked in for the night . they clustered eagerly round , interrupting every sentence . as children always do , even the best of them , while [female] told her story . and the story somehow seemed familiar to [female] . and [male] , and [male] , for it was the tale of mr. and mrs .
there were once a king and queen , who were very unhappy at not having any children . more unhappy than words can tell , vows , pilgrimages , everything was tried . but nothing was of any avail ; at length . however , a little daughter was born to them , there was a splendid christening . for godmothers , they gave the young princess all the fairies they could find in the country .
everywhere change works her will on things , everywhere , and even among the immortals , modernity spreads . even on olympus i suppose there is a progressive party and a new [male] agitating to supersede the horses of his father by some solar motor of his own . i suggested as much to [male] and he said `` horrible ! horrible ! '' and stared hard at my study fire , dear old [female] ! she gave him no end of facts about deep sea reading .
in to the forge flew a gadfly , it lighted on [male] 's hands and stung them . the dwarf screamed with pain , but his hands still held the bellows . working it to keep the fire steady , for he knew that the gadfly was [male] . and that [male] was striving to spoil [male] 's work . again the gadfly stung his hands , but [male] .
the maidens jumped out of the basket and began to dance round and round the ring trail . one behind the other , drumming with their fingers on little drums of eagle skin , and singing such beautiful songs as [female] had never heard . then [female] jumped up and ran towards the ring . crying out , `` let me dance and sing with you , '' the maidens were frightened . and ran to the basket and jumped in , and the basket flew up into the sky .
shall i tell you why ? because the fairy love went before her . picking up every rough stone and bur or [female] . and when the sun was hottest , shaded the invalid with her delicate purple wings . violet , too , had taught [female] how many pleasant things there are in the world even for one who is sick . so , instead of fretting because the way was dusty and the [female] hot .
he set a bottle for the water of the fountain of giantland carefully upon his head and slowly ascended the steep path . he kept his eyes fixed straight ahead , soon , however , he heard giant voices shouting at him . from the corners of his eyes he could see giant forms along the pathway . he forgot that he must look neither to the right nor to the left . the moment the prince turned his eyes a giant immediately seized him and made him his slave .
and he hated his gold sovereigns . as they lay with a broad smile of self satisfaction all over their yellow faces . the queen was in the parlour , eating bread and honey . but at the second mouthful she burst out crying , and could not swallow it . the king heard her sobbing .
the aspect of this edge of the town was not entirely without justification for the doctor 's hints about desolate moods and environments . the scattered houses stood farther and farther apart in a broken string along the seashore . the afternoon was closing with a premature and partly lurid twilight . the sea was of an inky purple and murmuring ominously , in the scrappy back garden of the macnabs which ran down towards the sand . two black , barren looking trees stood up like demon hands held up in astonishment .
it was the turks who had begun firing ; the russians were content with merely replying . neither side was visible to the other , but they fired , fearing lest , owing to the denseness of the fog . the enemy might approach close to them without being seen , on such occasions one fires involuntarily . it is a kind of mutual warning . `` i am not asleep , you understand ; take care !

a sound of soft music stole into the room . becoming louder and louder , the longer he listened , till at length a large hole burst open in the wall of the room . then there stepped into his presence two magnificent fairies . just arrived from their castles in the air , to pay him a visit . they had travelled all the way on purpose to talk with master no book .
the tower , with its wheel of red light . began again to revolve upon the waters , and they heard the witch 's shriek of rage as she awoke to the pain of her wound . to find the children gone , it came again and again , that shriek of baffled hate and rage and pain . then , as they looked back , they saw a dark form glide down the walls of the tower like a loathsome thing creeping head downwards . it reached the foot and sped to the seashore .

although she talked to the woman , [female] saw that she watched his three companions . him she did not notice , because the bench on which he sat was behind the others .

the touch of the traditional and popular manner in the story is the love of a woman redeeming the ugliness of a man . in one shape or another , from the kaffir bird who made milk . or five heads , to what was probably the original form of [male] and [male] . this is the fundamental notion of beauty and the beast . but [female] hints that the miracle was purely `` subjective .

the sun was shining gloriously ; the children that had been confirmed went out of the town . and from the wood was borne towards them the sounds of the unknown bell with wonderful distinctness . they all immediately felt a wish to go thither ; all except three , one of them had to go home to try on a ball dress . for it was just the dress and the ball which had caused her to be confirmed this time . for otherwise she would not have come ; the other was a poor boy , who had borrowed his coat and boots to be confirmed in from the innkeeper 's son .
this the king had stuck up on all the church doors in his realm . and had given it out in many other kingdoms besides , now , this princess was so lovely that all who set eyes on her fell over head and ears in love with her whether they would or no . so i need not tell you how all the princes and knights who heard of her were eager to win her to wife . and half the kingdom beside ; and how they came riding from all parts of the world on high prancing horses . and clad in the grandest clothes .
wee wun was a little gnome who lived in the bye-bye meadow . in a fine new house which he loved , to live in the bye-bye meadow was sometimes a dangerous thing . for all the big people lived there , [male] might have lived on the other common with the other gnomes and fairies if he had liked . but he did not , he liked better to be among the big people on the bye-bye meadow . and perhaps if he had not been such a careless fellow he might not have got into so much trouble there .
but her father would not hear of it , and since she insisted . he drove her from the castle in his rage . so the princess had to go off with the beggar , she dwelt with him in a little hut . and had to hunt for herbs and roots , and cook them herself . so that they might have something to eat ; and often they both went hungry .

the sultan had his own fetched , which they soon used . but to no purpose , for in a month 's time the work was not half done . [male] , knowing that their task was vain , bade them undo their work and carry the jewels back . and the genie finished the window at his command . the sultan was surprised to receive his jewels again and visited [male] .

that the wer vixen superstition is deeply engrained in the minds of travellers is proved by the story of a bishop who once passed the night in a house which was so desolate in appearance that his companions begged him to read a sutra for the purpose of driving away evil influences . two of them went to a wood close to the house . where they saw a mysterious phantom , large and white , which they took to be a wer vixen . they rushed in to tell the bishop , who , greatly excited , cried , i have often heard of foxes haunting people . but i have never set eyes on a ghost of this kind ,

to make sure of it , the sleepy boy now rubbed his eyes and cocked his ears . again , the light bearer spoke to him : `` come , '' could it be ? he had heard old people tell of the ladies of the wood . that whispered and warned travellers , in fact , he himself had often seen the fairies ring in the pine woods , to this , the flame lady was inviting him .
[male] and the [male] stood , side by side . with their backs against an oak , and as the lions and bears came within their reach .

there was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt , and as he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were there . he followed the sound , and at last came to a high tree . and at the top of this a little child was sitting , for the mother had fallen asleep under the tree with the child . and a bird of prey had seen it in her arms . had flown down , snatched it away , and set it on the high tree .

the light grew dim in the eyes of [male] . then he became mild and obedient , [male] threw the egg from one hand to the other .

the two children were so fond of one another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together . and when [female] said : `` we will not leave each other , '' [female] answered . `` never so long as we live , '' and their mother would add : `` what one has she must share with the other . '' they often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries . and no beasts did them any harm .
his own mother would never have recognised him , he looked something like a porcupine . but instead of sharp quills there were green leaves sticking out all over him . in this fashion he went to the drinking place and the [male] did not recognise him . he took a long , deep drink , he was so thirsty and the water tasted so good that he stayed in the drinking place too long . the leaves came out of the honey which had held them and the [male] saw that it was really the monkey .
how the wind was blowing , it sent the willow branches streaming . it wrinkled the lake water and turned the lotus leaves wrong side out . it scattered the petals of the chrysanthemums . it tossed the kites high in the air . how brightly their colors shone against the gray sky , some were made to look like pink and yellow melons with trailing leaves .

while the poor prince , all unprepared , would have to strain every muscle in his body to clear . in the midst of his rapid career , [location] . then she would wave her staff upwards . and the ground rise in front of her . like a steep and rocky hill , up which she would lightly run , while the prince could scarcely restrain himself from dashing violently against its stony face . then , while heated and breathless with the ascent of one of these , he would see her wave her staff downward .
from his pouch the old man took a little golden key , which he fitted into a key hole in the side of the chest . he threw back the lid ; the fisherman looked within . and there was the prettiest little palace that man 's eye ever beheld . all made of mother of pearl and silver frosted as white as snow , the old magician lifted the little palace out of the box and set it upon the ground . at the farther end was a golden throne , and upon it sat a lady more lovely and beautiful than a dream .
something dim and shadowy flitted past in the dark . with the whirring sound of a night bat , `` a bow and quiver ! '' repeated king [male] , and his face grew suddenly grave . i hope they were not prince [male] 's . i am greatly distressed by the fear that some dire mishap has come to him .
a glance of mother [female] 's eye directed her family . they each sought their ordinary drinking cup . which was of wood , and then bent the neck of the pitcher . but what was their astonishment to perceive the vessel turn into wrought silver in their hands . and to taste , instead of water , a liquor so delicious , that when the woodcutter and his wife had drunk .
when the fairies heard this they tossed their little red caps in the air . and cheered so loudly that a [male] who was clinging to a rose bud fell senseless to the ground . then the king ordered one of his pages to take a handful of berries . and to go to [male] and show him the way to dooros wood . the page , taking the berries with him .
suddenly it occurred to him that several years before . hang siang dsi had come to his house to congratulate him on his birthday . before he had left , he had written these words on a slip of paper . and his uncle had read them , without grasping their meaning . and now he was unconsciously singing the very lines of that song that his nephew had written .

at last they reached the end of the woodpath . and there lay waldheim -- for so the farm was called -- before them . a big dog sprang out to meet them , mother and [male] shrank back from his rough welcome . but [male] was soon ordering him about , and did not seem in the least surprised when he obeyed her . his name was [female] , the farm consisted of a group of buildings .
so the ogre ate his three sheep , and when he had done he went to a big oaken chest and took out three big bags of golden pieces . these he put on the table , and began to count their contents while his wife cleared away the breakfast things . and by and by his head began to nod , and at last he began to snore . and snored so loud that the whole house shook , then [male] nipped out of the oven and . seizing one of the bags of gold , crept away , and ran along the straight .
when the prince heard of the success of his errand . he ordered all his courtiers to be ready to accompany him next day when he went to bring home his bride . you can fancy what excitement there was at the laird 's house when the gallant company arrived . with their prince at their head , to greet the lady who was to be their princess . the old mother and the plain looking maid of all work ran hither and thither , fetching such meat and drink as the house could boast to set before their high born visitors .
as the evening drew near , she would go to the barred window and look out upon the luxurious landscape . thinking only of the coming of her lord ; and when she saw him . she would go timidly out to meet him , and hold her beautiful oval face up for a kiss . longing for him to throw his arms around her . and , if only for a moment , hold her to his heart .
ye saw him , when he in all his martial array sprang forwards and backwards . higher than he himself was tall , and if he sprang into the sea he swam like a whale . ye saw the two combatants : the one darted his javelin , the other caught it in the air . and cast it back again , so that it pierced through shield and man down into the earth . ye saw warriors with sharp swords and angry hearts .

and so , having charmed [male] to sleep , passed to the middle world where . like [male] , he was torn to pieces by his fellow mortals . the third case is that of [male] , the trojan prince . who made the journey to hades to find his lost love . [male] , and to consult his father , [male] . he repaired to a sibyl dwelling among the mountains .
the servants went out , and when [male] and his sons saw them coming they went into the hiding holes . the servants looked amongst the horses , and they did not find anything wrong . and they returned and they told this to the king . and the king said to them that if nothing was wrong they should go to their places of rest . when the gillies had time to be gone , [male] and his sons laid their hands again on the horse .
so , in her great thirst , the princess dismounted and stooped down to the stream and drank . as she might not have her golden cup , the poor princess said , `` alas ! '' and the drops of blood answered , if your mother knew this . it would break her heart , the royal bride was humble . so she said nothing , but mounted her horse again .
upon this the king commanded [male] to dismount and to beg the duchess to honour her by mounting her horse . the princess obeyed in silence , and the duchess . without looking at her or thanking her , scrambled up upon the beautiful horse , where she sat looking like a bundle of clothes . and eight officers had to hold her up for fear she should fall off . even then she was not satisfied , and was still grumbling and muttering , so they asked her what was the matter .

bo peep usually took her sheep to the side of a high hill above the cottage . and allowed them to eat the rich grass while she herself sat upon a mound and . laying aside her crook and her broad straw hat with its pink ribbons . devoted her time to sewing and mending stockings for her aged mother . `` good morning , little [female] , '' and looking up the girl saw a woman standing near her and leaning upon a short stick .
but it sours mine instead of sweetening it , although your picture be deeply engraven in my heart . my eyes desire constantly to see the original ; and their sight will vanish if they are much longer deprived of that pleasure . may i flatter myself that yours have the same impatience to see me ? yes i can ; their tender glances discovered it to me . how happy , prince , should you and [male] both be .
`` the day is mine , '' said she with much joy . and she emptied his pitcher and hastened on , and now all had been lost but for the huntsman who was standing on the castle wall . and with his keen eyes saw all that happened , `` we must not be outdone by the king 's daughter , '' said he , and he loaded his rifle and took so good an aim that he shot the horse 's skull from under the runner 's head without doing him any harm . and the runner awoke and jumped up , and saw his pitcher standing empty and the king 's daughter far on her way home .
then there is the lion on the roof who could tell a fine tale if he chose . the great banqueting hall and the little chapel . on the top of the tower is a beautiful cross that is lit up at night by electric light and can be seen from a great distance in the country round . this is of course a modern addition , but the most interesting room in the castle is that where dr [male] luther spent his time translating the bible . a reward had been offered to anyone who should kill this arch heretic ; so his friends brought him disguised as a knight to the wartburg .
in his fort he had a great banqueting hall . where handsome boys made sweet music . and others played games and did great feats of strength . he had a horse called [male] of the flowing mane . who could travel like the wind over sea as well as land .

`` we shall see , '' said [male] , quietly , and [male] was so frightened that he set off . and ran back towards the river with all his might , many of the people called to him to stop . but they could not run after him , because they wanted winding up . however , they would certainly have caught him if he had not been very quick . for before he got to the river he heard behind him the footsteps of those who had been first attended to by the queen .
if there are none and a parent survives , it goes to the parent . if there are neither children , grandchildren , nor parents it goes to brothers and sisters or their children . if there are none of these relatives the property goes to the uncles and aunts or cousins . this seems to be the extent of the kinship recognized by the igorot . if there are no relatives the property passes to the survivor of the union .
so many years have passed since the old poet , sitting under the three lindens half a league the other side of pesth . saw the fairies dance and heard the fairy music . so many years have passed since then , that had the old poet not left [location] an [female] of that fairy waltz there would be none now to believe the story i tell . who knows but that this very night the elves and the fairies will dance in the quiet valley . that little sorrowful will tinkle her maimed feet upon the singing violets , and that the little folk will illustrate in their revels .
oh , there was no secret about that ; it happened thus and so , and then the soldier told all about it . after that the other went home , but there was a great buzzing in his head . i can tell you , so , off he went until he came to the place where trouble lay under the stone . he rolled the stone over , and—whisk , clip ! —out popped trouble from the hole . and so you were leaving me here to be starved , were you ?

vivian became like a daughter to the old magician , and he taught her many of the most wonderful things that any mortal heart could think of . things past , things that were done , and part of what was to come . you have been told in [male] that [male] learned so many of [male] 's enchantments that in his old age she took advantage of him and put him to sleep forever in the hollow of a tree . but the older legend gives [location] better news . he showed her how to make a tower without walls so they might dwell there together alone in peace .
the garden was a very lovely place , being upon a mountain side . there were parts in it where the rocks came through in great masses . and all immediately about them remained quite wild , tufts of heather grew upon them . and other hardy mountain plants and flowers . while near them would be lovely roses and lilies .
so he called to the fish , and the fish dived to the bottom and slipped behind big stones . and moved little ones with its tail till it found the ring . and brought it to [male] in its mouth . well pleased with all he had done , [male] returned to the palace . but when the king took the precious objects to [female] .
the senator rebuked him for his interruption . after having of his own free will resigned his right ; moreover , that it was not so clear . that i had done the deed through avarice . for according to his own testimony , nothing had been taken from the corpse . yes , he went still further ; he told the governor that he must give an account of his daughter 's early life .
the mole took in his mouth a piece of phosphorescent wood . which glittered like fire in the dark , then he went before them to light them through the long , dark passage . when they came to the spot where the dead bird lay . the mole pushed his broad nose through the ceiling . so that the earth gave way and the daylight shone into the passage .
the sea covers today what was once the duchy of clarides . no trace of the town or the castle remains . but when it is calm there can be seen , it is said , within the circumference of a mile . huge trunks of trees standing on the bottom of the sea . a spot on the banks , which now serves as a station for the customhouse officers .
and what do you think he did ? oh , he was a wise dog . he took a piece of chalk . and he put a great white cross on every door in the town . early next morning the king and queen and all the lords and ladies of the court were astir . they had heard the old [female] 's story .

and did [female] become a great poet ? he is a friend of mine . so i can tell you , the world has not heard of him as yet . he tells me that he often hears a little voice near him . singing , singing ; sometimes he can distinguish the words and the melodies . they make him feel sad at times .

he lived by the shore of the big sea . where else could he live ? he had a wife called [female] . could you find a better name for her ? in winter they dwelt in a little cottage by the shore . but in spring they flitted to a red rock out in the sea and stayed there the whole summer until it was autumn . the cottage on the rock was even smaller than the other ; it had a wooden bolt instead of an iron lock to the door .
so [male] picked up the one that happened to be nearest him and put her on the [female] . and lo and behold , no sooner was she seated than she changed into a beautiful [female] . and the [female] and the mice into a grand chariot drawn by six prancing horses . as soon as he could stop rubbing his eyes from wonder . [male] kissed the [male] , and drove off in triumph to the palace .
upon her head she wore a high golden crown . and the sun beat upon it making it shine like real metal . and her eyes , her wonderful eyes , were full of tears ... but in her heart ... oh , did he rightly see ? or was he dreaming the same awful dream over again ? ... in her heart , too , a dagger had been thrust , must all hearts be killed ?
it is not possible that the health of one class should necessitate the ruin of another . and , in consequence , it is our first duty to turn a deaf ear to such an essential immoral doctrine . no matter how strongly society may have established or law protected it . moreover , it needs to be fully recognized that men are rightly to be held responsible for the consequences of their own acts . and that these are no longer to be visited on the woman alone , it follows from this that it is the duty of men who do not wish to lead a life of infamy to practice such continence in respect to all woman as they would were the female society in which they move made up exclusively of their own mothers and sisters .
so the princess told the king what the wise bird had bidden her to say . and the king went straightway to the faithful servant , `` then you shall have it , '' says the faithful servant ; but the king had to cut the hand off . for the faithful servant could not do it himself . but , bless your heart , the armlet was ever so much too large for the king to wear !
she had no fear of mother frost 's great teeth . but walked right up to the old woman and offered to be her servant , for a whole day the girl was very busy . and did everything that she was told to do , on the second day she began to be lazy . and on the third day she was still worse , the bed was never made . or shaken , so the feathers could fly about , at last mother frost grew tired of her and told her that she must go away .
[male] was alarmed , and began to repent having left the vessel ; when the magician . seeing his colour change , desired him to calm his apprehensions . for which there was no cause , that he had only to obey his orders and be happy . he had scarcely spoken when the wind ceased , the dust dispersed . and three camels stood before them , one of which was laden with water and provisions .
then , as one man , that great multitude gave such a sudden , wild , tremendous shout . that it took the roof right off the top of the house . and the wood that fell in every direction outside , was enough to keep the poor people in kindling wood all winter . the giant , whirling his iron helmet around his head . now led off , with a thundering `` hip , hip , hurra ! ''
young boys and girls may try their hand at several different sports and then gravitate toward the best opportunities for `` showcasing their talents . '' writers presumably conduct their own trials and errors , too , with the misbegotten products left buried in desk drawers . if not destroyed , [male] false start , la vendée . a historical romance , was published , but it 's fair to say that it has not been remembered . it was his third novel , following two irish novels .

the coarse , homely life of schwarzenburg was in extreme contrast to that of [female] and was most uncongenial to a sensitive nature . but [female] was saved from melancholy by the companionship she felt in the grand pine forests . which soothed her discontent , while her work left her little time to pine for the happiness she had left or even to mourn the terrible loss of her mother . her father 's restlessness returned , and they were again in [female] for a short time . and then in [female] , here she studied assiduously awhile , but again her father 's discontent drove him on .
then the officer in pyjamas accosted me . and the thread of the other 's talk was lost , when i moved off to dress he had already left his perch among the sand bags . i climbed the [male] , and had my coffee . soon after came the scurry to stations , we were coming into the bay in the glory of that morning under hangings of amber and rose and feathery grey . the four inch gun 's crew were in their places .
and soon came a gale of wind , and carried away [female] 's hat . while the girl went on combing and curling her hair , all this the old king saw . so he went home without being seen ; and when the little goose girl came back in the evening . he called her aside . and asked her why she did so : but she burst into tears .
in their fear the people cried upon the king to save them from the monster . but the king had no power to save them more than any other man . his sword , snickersnapper , was the brightest and sharpest and most wonderful sword in all the world . but it would need a longer sword than snickersnapper to pierce through that great body to the monster 's heart . the king summoned his councillors , -- all the wisest men in the kingdom .

so [person] gave the word to the stags . and they began to rise from the water in a spiral line upwards as an [organization] soars in chase of a swan . when they had reached a sufficiently great height , the goddess once more let loose the reins . and the deer bounded forward again like an arrow released from a bow . swiftly they neared the land ; but from where they were nothing could be seen of the things on it .
the queerbody explained , next appeared the body in a long flowing robe fastened by an embroidered girdle . then beautiful white hands and arms , at last it was all done but the feet . with her eyes fixed lovingly upon the figure she had made . the queerbody reached down into a jar that she had not touched before . suddenly her look changed , the smile faded from her face and she turned her eyes on [female] .
they generally cry at nobody , especially when they wake up at night . but it was an especial disappointment to diamond . for his little heart had been beating with joy : the face of the north wind was so grand ! to have a lady like that for a friend -- with such long hair , too ! why , it was longer than twenty diamonds tails ! she was gone .
now the place toward which the princess went was the tomb of the [female] rajah . but this she did not know , [female] rajah had died many months before . and his father and mother and sisters . who loved him very dearly , could not bear the idea of his being buried under the cold ground . so they had built a beautiful tomb , and inside it they had placed the body on a bed under a canopy .

the ogre had happened to choose a horse which he had bought only the day before . and he did not know it was a magician , or he would not have been so foolish as to fix upon it on this occasion . the horse no sooner had been driven off with the prince 's body on its back than it galloped straight to the home of the fairies . and knocked at the door with its hoof , the fairies heard the knock . but were afraid to open till they had peeped from an upper window to see that it was no giant or ogre who could do them harm .

[male] bones , too , who , shortly after his rival 's disappearance conducted the blooming [male] in triumph to the altar . was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of [male] was related , and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the pumpkin . which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell .
my cousin fell into profound musings , then he started . looked about him , saw the time by his rathbone clock . got up suddenly and went to bed , the crisis came about a week from that time . i say about because of [male] 's conscientious inexactness in these matters . and so far as the crisis goes , i seem to get [male] at his best .
he awoke at the breaking of the morning . and saw that he was almost at the water 's edge . he looked out to sea , and saw the island , but nowhere could he see the water steeds . and he began to fear he must have taken a wrong course in the night . and that the island before him was not the one he was in search of .

within the hollow wall of an old brick mansion . away up near the roof , there lived a family of mice . it was a snug little home , pleasant and quiet , and as dark as any mouse could desire .

[male] took this pretext to have the kitchen stove lighted in spite of mother [male] 's remarks .
but her hopes were doomed to meet a disappointment , for when it had been announced to her by her couriers . who had been posted to watch the arrival of the prince , that he approached . she was incredulous ; but when she saw him mounted on a foaming black steed . richly harnessed , and leading a strange kind of animal by a silver chain . she at once knew he was returning in triumph .
this appeal was made to [female] , and the baron 's daughter drew her white velvet cloak from her shoulders and handed it to the fairy . a moment later it was transformed into a suit of glittering armor that seemed fashioned of pure silver inlaid with gold . while the sheet of bark at the same time became a handsome shield . with the figures of three girls graven upon it .

when he had been at home a few days . he rode out with [male] one morning to the heath where the dragon used to lie . then he saw the track which the dragon made when he went to a cliff to drink . and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley . then [male] went down into that deep place , and dug many pits in it .
nightly upon the plain of kings , when [male] 's day is nigh , he gallops . and the dark wind brings his lonely human cry . the family of [male] had joined itself to the [male] faith . and his three brothers were bishops and abbots of the church . but [male] himself remained a pagan .

after a little while the wise woman began to sing to her , and the princess could not help listening . for the soft wind amongst the low dry bushes of the heath . the rustle of their own steps , and the trailing of the wise woman 's cloak . were the only sounds beside , out in the cold , with a thin worn fold of withered gold around her rolled . hangs in the air the weary moon .
the boy saw that he would die of weariness long before he reached the end of [male] . but he stuck to it like the other boy who stood by the burning deck long after it was `` time for him to go . '' so [male] was taken away from him and locked up , and so his life was saved . now , in the first place [male] was a romance . but it was not like the romances in this book .
terror and alarm filled the minds of the multitude and they scattered in confusion . but as soon as he had gained the eminence , [male] stood still . causing his daughter to do the same -- deeming it cowardly to fly , and impossible . if it was attempted , to divert the designs of the great spirit . the descending object now assumed a more definite aspect ; and , as it came nearer .

these nine ciphers are disposed in three horizontal lines ; add the three ciphers of each line . and the sum is 15 ; add the three ciphers in each column . the sum is 15 ; add the three ciphers forming diagonals . and the sum is 15 , but the connection of certain numbers with the dogmas of religion was sufficient . besides their [male] properties , to make superstition attach itself to them .
gil gently loosened the sea child 's hand and ran home as the [male] bade him . but said no word of all this to any one , they called the baby 's name [male] and from the first little [male] was very happy in his new home . he was happy all day in his mother 's arms . happy when his foster father came home at night and tossed him high to the ceiling . happiest of all when [male] held him close and begged him to hurry and grow up .

but amid all the leafy haunts , none drew her steps toward it so often as a forest of pines . on the open shore , called manitowok , or the sacred wood . it was one of those hallowed places which is the resort of the little wild men of the woods . and of the turtle spirits or fairies which delight in romantic scenes . owing to this circumstance , its green retirement was seldom visited by indians .
horn of the morning , and the little night pipings fail . the day is launched like a hollow ship with the sun for a sail . the way is wide and blue and lone with all its miles inviolate save for the swinging stars we ve sown and a [person] of cloud remote and blown . oh , i passion for something nearer than these , how shall i know that this live thing is i with only the morning for proof and the sky ?
she had made a superb toilet , in her flowing gold brocade . cut square in front to reveal the whitest of necks . with her black hair falling in two braids to her knees and twined with pearls which were caught up in loops at her waist . she looked indeed a queen ; while [female] and [female] . taken utterly by surprise , seemed to be two conspirators whom she had caught in the act of plotting against her .
in no case could a community such as this exist without the sanction of the king . who placed it under the safeguard of the crown . at first the kings , blinded by a covetous policy , only seemed to see in the issue of these charters an excellent pretext for extorting money . if they consented to recognise them , and even to help them against their lords . it was on account of the enormous sacrifices made by the towns .
far into the night they sat and talked of many things . the [male] was pleased at his host 's waggish whim of playing the role of servant to a royal master . and [male] , for his part , was delighted at his guest 's refined manners and his great knowledge on many subjects . `` i am , indeed , a proud man to be honoured by the company of so accomplished and polite a personage , '' he said , and , even if he had known that he was entertaining the [male] of [male] .

indeed , he had no need for any alarm to wake him from his heavy slumbers and call him to his work in the fields . however cautiously a mushroom made its appearance , at its first rumble , old [male] would jump from his hard bed . hastily dress himself , and , often without tasting a morsel of breakfast . be out of the house and on to the field in time to see the newcomer pop its head through the earth . this he would pick , and then he would [male] about with his head on one side listening for others like some old starling listening for worms .
and [female] leapt to his feet . and answered— `` my tortoise is empty and hungry , and my feet need washing today.

the princess returned to her rooms , and the giant summoned all his dwarfs . and he ordered them to go forth in the dawning of the morn and to gather all the fairy dew lying on the bushes . and to wind three balls -- one yellow , one red . and one blue , the next morning , and the next , and the next . the dwarfs went out into the fields and searched all the hedgerows .

the world was not changed , but more beautiful than ever ; gloriously beautiful loomed the ever changing horizon . yet [female] sobbed , full of sadness . she knew that the horizons were pure delusions . and that behind them was the desert with the sphinx , oh ! if she could once more believe in the aerial paradises , the purple seas .

yes , that she would , and all at once the pails began to shamble up the hill . `` dear me , did you ever see anything like it ?

the duke was not alone in his enjoyment of the adventures of [male] . the little vixen has provided pleasant diversion for many readers . she continues to amuse , the familiar characters of [female] carry on for us .

when the words `` shall be hung until death doth ensue '' are to be found in a sentence , it must not be supposed that they were used merely as a form . for in certain cases the judge ordered that the sentence should be only carried out as far as would prove to the culprit the awful sensation of hanging . in such cases , the victim was simply suspended by ropes passing under the arm pits . a kind of exhibition which was not free from danger when it was too prolonged .
the investigation into what constitutes this purification and ennoblement of character . and the endeavour to realise what that expansion of consciousness really means are subjects which have been written of elsewhere . suffice it now to point out that the founding of a lodge of initiation for the sake of beings who came from another scheme of evolution is an indication of the unity of object and of aim in the government and the guidance of all the schemes of evolution brought into existence by our solar logos . apart from the normal course in our own scheme , there is , we know . a path by which he may be directly reached , which every son of man in his progress through the ages is privileged to hear of .
the commonplace proved a most felicitous question , the lady described material . took her measurements out of her purse , and discussed ruffles and tucks and described location and size of windows . during which talk the young girl was able to throw off the spell that had held her mute . she did not suspect how her companion was listening with discriminating ears to her speech . and the very tones of her voice , and watching with discriminating eyes her manner and expression .
during the first hundred years imprisonment , i swore that if one would deliver me before the hundred years expired . i would make him rich even after his death . but that century ran out , and nobody did me that good office . during the second , i made an oath , that i would open all the treasures of the earth to any one that would set me at liberty . but with no better success , in the third , i promised to make my deliverer a potent monarch .
`` just you wait a moment , you little beggar , '' he cried out , `` i will soon have you ! '' and at one bound he was behind the pine tree , but there was no `` guardian of gold in the pine tree wold , '' nothing but a pretty little squirrel clambering away up the tree , [male] munk shook his head . he perceived that he had succeeded in working the spell to a certain degree .
he gave an order that if the knight made off again he was to be pursued and brought back . on the third day the youth received from iron [male] a black outfit . and a fiery black charger , again he caught the apple . but as he was riding off with it the king 's people chased him . and one came so near that he wounded him in the leg .
near three years sir [male] kept the fair [male] with him in joyous [male] . and then by means of treaties he brought her again unto king fox . which was the name sir [male] gave unto mark because of his wiles and treason . but ever the malice of king fox followed his brave nephew . and in the end he slew him as he sat harping afore his lady .
`` you may please yourself , '' growled [male] . and went on smoking , then he asked her where she lived . and she said far away by the sea , and [female] asked her about the sea . and she told him how it rolled and roared over the rocks in winter nights . and lay still in the bright summer days .
there was a grand shooting party , and the sportsmen lay hidden round the marsh . some even sat on the branches of the trees which overhung the water . the blue smoke rose like clouds among the dark trees and swept over the pool . the water dogs wandered about in the swamp -- splash , splash ! the rushes and reeds bent beneath their tread on all sides . it was terribly alarming to the poor duckling , he twisted his head round to get it under his wing .
`` what 's the horse 's name ? '' whispered diamond . as he took the reins from the man . he did not finish the sentence , [male] handed diamond a whip . with which , by holding it half down the stick , he managed just to flack the haunches of the horse . and away he went , `` mind the gate , '' said mr. [male] .
the young warrior came to the lodge door , and [male] refused to see him . informing her parents , at the same time , that she would never consent to the match . it had been her custom to pass many of her hours in her favorite place of retirement . under a broad topped young pine , whose leaves whispered in every wind that blew . but most of all in that [female] of the air at the evening hour .
the canary felt very sorry for the poor crow whom no one loved , it must be very hard to live under such circumstances . on the whole , there were many enemies , for instance . [male] , with his oily eyes , watching the birds and always feigning sleep . the canary saw with her own eyes how he caught a young inexperienced sparrow . one could only see the feathers flying , and hear the bones crackling , horrible ! horrible !
`` i am sick of children ! '' said the king to his secretary , as he finished dictating the direction . after prince was gone , the princess , by degrees . fell back into some of her bad old ways , from which only the presence of the dog . not her own betterment , had kept her , she never grew nearly so selfish again .
snow white was more [female] , and quieter than her sister . who liked better skipping about the fields , seeking flowers , and catching summer birds . while [female] stayed at home with her mother . either helping her in her work , or , when that was done , reading aloud . the two children had the greatest affection the one for the other .
the illumination extended even to the most retired of the garden walks . at least not so retired that any one need lose himself there , in the borders were placed bottles . each containing a light , and among them the bottle with which we are acquainted . and whose fate it was , one day . to be only a bottle neck , and to serve as a water glass to a bird's cage .
the [male] kissed him thrice and promised . and springing into his boat , prince [male] sailed away . she stood upon the shore and blew him kisses and caresses . but soon his form was lost in darkness and the mists . and [female] was left forlorn , now in those olden days , when princes journeyed around the world on errands for the maidens whom they loved .

it is easy to imagine that prince [male] was exceedingly grieved to be forced to stay longer in a country where he neither had nor wished to have any acquaintance . to think that he must wait another twelvemonth for the opportunity he had lost . but the greatest affliction of all was his having let go the princess [female] 's talisman . which he now gave over for lost , the only course that was left for him to take was to return to the garden to rent it of the landlord . and to continue to cultivate it by himself , deploring his [male] and misfortunes .
`` i am the little white hen and i am carrying a letter to the king , '' replied the little white hen , she did not say a word about the fox and the river and the fire which she had in her little brown basket . she was so frightened before the great royal doorkeeper of the palace that she could hardly find her voice at all . the royal doorkeeper invited the little white hen to enter the palace and he led her to the royal throne where the king was sitting . the little white hen bowed very low before the king -- so low , in fact .

the great festival drew still nearer , to the children 's delight . as they watched the previously described graceful [female] arch rise before their gateposts . then came a party of three with an oven , a bottomless tub . and some matting to replace the bottom , they shifted the pole that carried these utensils from their shoulders . and commenced to make the japanese cake that may be viewed as the equivalent of a christmas pudding .

and how , after that , a wee , wee man had jumped up from under a great mossy stone . with a tiny set of bagpipes under his arm . and how he had piped such wonderful music , that , at the sound of it . the very trouts jumped out of the loch below , and the stoats crept out of their holes . and the corby crows and the herons came and sat on the trees in the darkness , to listen .

not far off sat [female] , the witch , her head bent down upon her [female] knees . whilst the storm played amongst the frosted wisps of her hair . from all sides weird chants rose into the wintry air where the old women . sitting round their blazing fire , were singing dirges for the dead . and now came the moment when the black eyed , black haired sons of the wild came to carry [female] to her last narrow bed .
there was general rejoicing when the dog made his appearance . running from one to another to get acquainted , and then , as they had already been delayed quite a little . they made haste to continue on their journey . together they traveled along the road the greater part of the day without mishap and without any [female] worth recording . as was her custom , the masked lady did not make her appearance among them as long as they were quite light hearted .

mossy followed him , the waves flew from before the footsteps of the old man of the sea . and mossy followed upon dry sand , when they had reached the cave . they sat down and gazed at each other , now mossy was an old man by this time . he looked much older than the old man of the sea . and his feet were very weary , after looking at him for a moment .
in despair [male] looked around him . on all sides the awful solitude shut him in . rows on rows of giants frowned down upon his sorry plight . the wind rustled through their branches that looked like monstrous arms gesticulating in angry discussions over the heads of these two forlorn human beings . to [male] they suddenly appeared like enemies come together from all parts of the world to plan his destruction .
it was not a great while before he heard her coming along the passageway crying bitterly . this circumstance surprised him , because [male] was one of the cheerfullest little people whom you would see in a summer 's day . and hardly shed a thimbleful of tears in a twelvemonth . when [female] heard her sobs , he determined to put little [male] into better spirits . by an agreeable surprise ; so , leaning across the table , he touched his daughter 's bowl ( which was a [location] one .
after securing such important concessions from [male] , the english king . if be had been wise , would have pursued a mild and conciliatory policy towards the nobles and barons of the [male] nation . unfortunately for his reputation and statesmanship , good-will towards the conquered formed no part of the imperial virtues . he ruled with a [male] of iron . the olive branch forming no part of the device upon the king 's banner .
as she stood before them in all her rich dress . she looked so dazzlingly beautiful that the court bowed low in her presence . then the king declared his intention of making her his bride . but the archbishop shook his head , and whispered that the fair young [male] was only a witch who had blinded the king 's eyes and enchanted his heart . but the king would not listen to this ; he ordered the music to sound .

the whole time they were at their diversions [female] 's child never quit watching the pair . maybe it 's in expectation he was of getting his taste of the feast . the butter cake was doing nicely , turning a grand colour and a lovely smell rising off it . the two heroes were in the best of humour , chatting other and funning , when all of a sudden the servant boy chanced to look out over the half door . i declare to man , we are destroyed entirely , ', says he .

although the last chronicle serves as a grand summation of the barsetshire series and reprise for its characters . it is around mr.

then away went the great water horse over the water and through the spray and [female] was not the least bit afraid although she had no water wings and might have slipped of into the water . `` where are we going ?

in vain [male] cried for [male] . the farmer and his sons were fast asleep . and not a soul heard her , all night long the leperhaun dragged her about . and when the cock crowed he vanished , leaving her bruised and sore upon the threshold of the door . more dead than alive , [female] crawled up to her bed , where she lay black and blue for many a day .
in austria , too , some good cabinet work was being carried out . m. leistler , of [location] , having at the time a high reputation . in [location] the house of fourdinois was making a name which . in subsequent exhibitions , we shall see took a leading place amongst the designers and manufacturers of decorative furniture .

the expression `` japanese art '' seems but a created word expressing either the imitations of it . or the artificial transplanting of japanese things to our houses . the whole glory of art in [location] is . that it is not art , but nature simply rendered , by a people with a fancy and love of fun quite irish in character . just as greek sculptures were good , because in those days artists modelled the corsetless life around them .
a young wife had not , as was customary at that time , learned to spin and weave . she tried in every way to learn , but try as she might she made no progress . till one noon day she wished some one would come to help her , she then saw a woman standing in the door . who said she would help her on condition that she would give her her first child when born . but if she could tell the shi woman 's name when she came to take away the child she would be free from her promise .

indeed , brotherhoods amongst the labouring classes always existed under the german conquerors from the moment when [location] . so long divided into roman provinces , shook off the yoke of subjection to rome . although she still adhered to the laws and customs of the nation which had held her in subjection for so many generations . we can , however , only regard the few traces which remain of these brotherhoods as evidence of their having once existed . and not as indicative of their having been in a flourishing state , in the fifth century .
the animals then consulted together how they should manage to drive out the robbers . till at last they settled on a plan . tie donkey was to place himself with his forefeet on the window sill . the dog to climb on the donkey 's back . and the cat on the dog 's , and , at last , the cock was to fly up and perch himself on the cat 's head .
country , none is better calculated to inspire sad reflections than a rural graveyard . the walls of the ruined church tower on high . with massive cornice and pointed window ; within stand monuments and tombs of the irish great . kings , princes , and archbishops lie together . while about the hallowed edifice are huddled the graves of the poor ; here , sinking so as to be indistinguishable from the sod .

he could see the scent like mists of the same colour as the rose . issuing like a slow fountain and spreading in the air till it joined the thin rosy vapour which hung over all the wilderness . but again came the voice calling him , and it seemed to come from over his head . he looked up , but saw only the deep blue sky full of stars . more brilliant , however , than he had seen them before ; and both sky and stars looked nearer to the earth .
notwithstanding that under the carlovingian dynasty it was always considered a shame and a dishonour to have the head shaved . it must not be supposed that the upper classes continued to wear the long merovingian style of hair . after the reign of [female] , it was the fashion to shave the hair from above the forehead . the parting being thus widened , and the hair was so arranged that it should not fall lower than the middle of the neck . under [male] the bald , whose surname proves that he was not partial to long hair .

a big girl lost her hold and rolled down the roof into a wide leaden gutter . where she hung , half on and half off , dozens of boys and girls sat astride the ridgepoles . as if riding cockhorses , the big boys began to shout with glee . but the little ones were crying with fright ; and at the hubbub all the doors flew open and all the fathers and mothers ran out . and when they saw what it was , a mighty shout went up .

singing at the top of their voices , the lads walked through the woods towards a spot from where they could see a second range of mountains . as they neared the spot they saw a light above those mountains brighter than they had ever seen before . and it fluttered like a golden banner , the lads were dumbfounded with amazement . when all of a sudden the light vanished from off the mountain and reappeared above a great rock nearer at hand . then still nearer , above an old limetree , and at last shone like burnished gold right in front of them .
and behold , the door opened and shut . and slammed against the walls like an eagle flapping its wings . you may judge what a dance the poor captive kept up all night . never had he tried such a waltz , and i imagine that he never wished to dance a second one of the same sort . sometimes the door swung open with him in the street .

among other disgusting crimes , [female] murdered a girl of eight in a garden by cracking her neck between his jaws . and he killed a goat near to the farm of one master [male] . first by setting on it with his teeth and then by gashing its throat with a knife . the latter operation leads to the belief that he had resumed his ordinary shape at the time . a peculiar point worth noticing about the case of [male] and [male] was that the former was able to transform himself at any moment with his clothes on .
a [female] , or priest , who lived near that place used to send his followers daily to bring food and water for him . and one of them , mistaking the dry pit for a well . let down his chattie for water , whereupon [male] . whose hands and feet had been restored by the almighty . caught hold of the chattie and would not let it go .

the princess fell asleep , flattering herself that she had only to relate her story for the sultan to be touched by compassion . and to restore her to the prince without delay . but a few hours were to undeceive her , when the king of cashmere had quitted her presence the evening before . he had resolved that the sun should not set again without the princess becoming his wife . and at daybreak proclamation of his intention was made throughout the town .
for some hours all went well ; and in the heat of the chase the young men forgot their fears . then suddenly both of them reined in their steeds and sat gazing in front of them with affrighted faces . for a horseman had crossed their track , and they both would fain have known who he was and whence he came . and without another word he put spurs to his horse and galloped off in the direction which the mysterious stranger had taken . leaving earlclair alone upon the moorland , his fingers touching the sacred sign and his [male] lips muttering prayers for [male] .
instead of seeing him grow thinner day by day . as she had expected , he constantly gained flesh , she soon discovered that [female] must be at the bottom of the mystery . for she perceived that the boy took much better care of him than of the other cattle . how should she manage to find out what he did and ate in the woods ? she secretly sent her daughter after him .
they represent the folk tale in all stages of its development from the bald narrative of the bird with the golden gizzard which kulda reports with phonographic exactness . to [location] 's more elaborate tale , prince [male] . which is really a mosaic of two or three simpler stories . i have included [male] and the devil for the sake of its keen humor . which is particularly czech in character ; the betrothal gifts to show how a story common to other countries is made most charmingly local by giving it a local background .
he walked on with slow steps , but he found no comfort . turn where he would ; the sweet songs of the forest jarred upon his ear . the beauty of the blue sky pained his sight . and the soft green earth , as he trod upon it . seemed harsh to his foot and sent a pang through every nerve .
he had fallen in love with her almost , already . for her anger made her more charming than any one else had ever beheld her . and , as far as he could see , which certainly was not far , she had not a single fault about her . except , of course , that she had not any gravity . no prince , however , would judge of a princess by weight .
many frenchmen were in the habit of coming to our house . and one of them prevailed upon my father to let me go to the city of [location] . in his fatherland , where one could learn the profession gratuitously . and with the best advantages : he himself would take me with him . at his own expense , when he returned , my father .
tiki pu was sobbing , and the tears were running down his cheeks as he stepped out of [male] 's wonderfully painted garden and stood once more upon earth . turning , he saw the old man walking away along the path toward the little door under the palace wall . at the door [male] turned back and waved his hand for the last time .

the councilors were greatly pleased when they found this law . for it enabled them to solve the problem that confronted them . so when the king had breathed his last they blindfolded the prime minister and led him forth from the palace . and he began walking about with outstretched arms seeking someone to touch . of course the people knew nothing of this law .
but prince fire fade was a hunter . who got his luck upon the mountains and in the forest . who bound sandals fast upon his feet , and bore a bow and heavenly feathered arrows . and he caught things rough of hair and things soft of hair . and he knew the trail of the badger and the wild [male] 's time of flowering .
when the three came near the house of [female] , [female] 's mother . where the ways divided , [female] said : now , nephew [male] . we need no longer delay what we would do , and then [male] knew that he had fallen into their snare . he ran up a bank beside the road . and the two set on him from below , and he defended himself at first manfully with the crooked cudgel .

the shilling was made of silver , it contained very little copper . and considered itself quite out in the world when it had been circulated for a year in the country in which it had been coined . one day , it really did go out into the world . for it belonged to a gentleman who was about to travel in foreign lands . this gentleman was not aware that the shilling lay at the bottom of his purse when he started .
so you may fancy what a dance the attorney had all night long . such a waltz he never had before , and i do not think he would much care if he never had such a waltz again . now he pulled the door forward , and then the door pulled him back . and so he went on , now dashed into one corner of the porch . and now into the other , till he was almost battered to death , at first he began to curse and swear .

one morning , when the prince was up early , and , as he used to do . was preparing to work in the garden , the gardener prevented him . saying , this day is a great festival among the idolaters . and because they abstain from work themselves . spending their time in abominable mysteries and public rejoicings .
the queen was thus conducted to a delicious grove : a [female] fountain rose in the midst . its waters , of the purest rose colour , wound along the meadow , murmuring plaintive airs . whose words were perfectly distinguishable , the fairy there welcomed her majesty . who prepared to explain the occasion of her journey ; but that was quite unnecessary . the fairy , exacting profound secrecy .

peter thanked her for her counsel , and was careful to do exactly all the old woman had told him . on the eighth morning he reached a fire so large that he could see nothing else on either side . but when he struck it with the napkins it parted . and stood on each hand like a wall , as he rode through the opening he threw the cakes behind him . from each cake there sprang a huge dog , and he gave them the names of world's weight .
his vizier , however , dissuaded him , `` time alone can show , '' said he , whether her demerits are so great as you now suppose . let her go back to her own people and remain in banishment until the will of heaven shall declare itself . and if within due time she give birth to a son then can she return to you with all honour . so the king did as his vizier advised , and sent [female] back to her own country to the court of the prince of samaria .

the taste for cabinets kept up and the cabinets and presses were large . sometimes divided into two parts , sometimes with doors , sometimes with open frame underneath . the tables were richly carved and gilded , often ornamented with bronze and copper . the cartouche was used a great deal in decoration . with a curved surface , this rounded form appears in the posts used in various kinds of furniture .
the giants , the dragons , the iron shod lions . the fairies , the flowers , and the sun . what had they all been doing ? nobody had watched , had nobody been at his post ? the fairy [male] now fell into a perfect rage , lions , dragons , giants ! set forth , pursue , catch .
`` certainly not , heaven forbid , '' replied [female] , digging on around the well . now , another long discussion followed ; and this time , too , the dragon could only persuade [male] by promising him seven sacks of ducats . on the third day , that is the last one , the she dragon sent them into the forest for wood . before one could count three , the dragon tore up more trees than [male] had ever seen before in his whole life . and piled them up together , but [male] began to examine the trees .
while [female] sat by himself in the evening . wishing from his heart that the seven years were over , he heard in the corner a loud groan . now the old soldier had a compassionate heart , so he opened the door and saw an old man weeping violently and wringing his hands .

they beat the serpent drums . for they had no bells , on the tops of the temples . they went quite mad with delight : enemies kissed in the streets . and all the parents , without exception , allowed all the young people who happened to be in love to be married that very day . then [male] brought back all the maidens , one after the other , and [male] last .
but when he reached his home he was speedily undeceived . for his wife looked at him as if he were a ghost . and the children whom he had left wee . toddling things were now well grown boys and girls . who stared at him as if he had been an utter stranger .
thanks to his studies , and to those of other naturalists who have followed in his steps . we now know almost as much about the home of bees as we do about our own . and if we follow out today the building of a bee city and the life of its inhabitants . i think you will acknowledge that they are a wonderful community . and that it is a great compliment to anyone to say that he or she is `` as busy as a [female] .

the recollection even of their younger days passed so rapidly in a round of mirth and pleasure was their greatest torment . the youngest girl , however , displayed greater perseverance and firmness in their common misfortune . she bore her lot cheerfully . and with a strength of mind much beyond her years . not but what , at first , she was truly melancholy , alas , who would not have felt such misfortunes .
the days passed by in keener enjoyment than even his boyish dreams had pictured . the hours were bright with happy [male] , in spite of the double burden of work which he . contrary to the custom of his predecessors , had undertaken in the consciousness of his own powers and fidelity . and when the day had flown by with its quick succession of pleasure and [male] . the evening hour would come when the beloved guest sat at the fire and at the oaken table .
[female] had now left the snow maiden far behind , had left her there amongst the broken hearts she tended with such [female] hand and deep understanding . he had gazed his last upon her as she stood in the circle of light all shining and bright . and then , knowing that he must go , he had torn himself away . feeling that otherwise he would not have the strength to continue his road . and part from a being so full of [male] and wonderful beauty .
her portraits were considered excellent as likenesses ; her touch was firm . her color brilliant , and her works in oils and water colors as well as her miniatures were much esteemed . many of them were engraved , her portrait of the sculptor [female] is in the national portrait gallery , [location] . a life size portrait of [female] , miniature painter . called `` devotion , '' and the `` sisters , '' portraits of mrs. carpenter 's daughters .

[female] thanked the lady in the golden dress . and when he woke he found the two laurel bushes beside him . so he carefully obeyed the orders he had been given by the lady . that evening , when the princesses went upstairs to bed , he followed them barefoot . so that he might make no noise , and hid himself under one of the twelve beds .
any one can see that , said turkey gobbler , it is written all over his face . `` foolish gander , '' and nothing else , but it is not really the gander . for , after all , can one be angry with a fool ? the rooster , for instance . the most ordinary rooster , did you hear him scream at me the other day ? he screamed so loudly that all the neighbors heard him .
the greatest treasure in the house was saved ; and he ran away with it to the roof . and seated himself on the chimney , the flames of the burning house opposite illuminated him as he sat . both hands pressed tightly over his cap , in which the treasure lay . and then he found out what feelings really reigned in his heart . and knew exactly which way they tended , and yet , when the fire was extinguished .
the emperor of [location] , who was fond of every thing that was curious . and notwithstanding the many prodigies of art he had seen had never beheld or heard of anything that came up to this . told the hindoo , that nothing but the [male] of what he asserted could convince him . and that he was ready to see him perform what he had promised . the hindoo instantly put his foot into the stirrup .

urashima was then conducted to the gate by the court officials . led by the dolphin , there the royal sturgeon blew a loud whistle . and presently a large tortoise came up , as [person] mounted on its back . it averted its head as if to conceal its eyes . perhaps it had a reason , and for that same identical reason [person] sat on its back stolidly .
and she was gone again , neither could the prince see what had become of her . he went far and wide to inquire for that country from whence she had said that she came . but there was no one who could tell him where it lay . so he was forced to have [male] once more , next sunday some one had to go to the prince with a comb .

the trojans being informed by one of their spies of the defection of [female] . became emboldened by the absence of this brave and intrepid leader . whom they feared above all the other greek heroes ; they accordingly sallied forth . and made a bold and eminently successful attack upon the greeks , who , although they most bravely and obstinately defended their position . were completely routed , and driven back to their intrenchments , [female] and most of the other greek leaders being wounded in the engagement .
the old bell was , after a time , carried away to a greater distance than any one . even the warder in the bell tower , ever imagined . and the bell in the breast of the young man was heard in countries where his feet had never wandered . the tones went forth over the wide ocean to every part of the round world . we will now follow the career of the old bell .

still , he hoped she would become tired before long , so that he might overtake her . after all , it was rather uncomfortable , pursuing her in the dark , his own feet made a fearful noise . a ghostly patter which awoke the night echoes . moreover , certain wild creatures of the forest were disturbed , an owl dashed from its branches overhead and went sailing down the avenues of the forest . a rabbit , sitting on a little hummock , dropped its forefeet to the ground and went prancing away .

so you see the giant was not such a bad sort of fellow after all . and prince [male] always admitted that he never met a foe more gallant and good humoured . with such a clever wife , [male] easily passed all his examinations . and his little son , prince [male] . never had to cry , `` mamma , mamma , father 's plucked again . ''
`` poor mad [male] , '' said the people . and this was the end of a life whose infancy was to have been surrounded with wealth and splendour had his parents lived ! all his great mental abilities had been lost , nothing but hardship . sorrow , and disappointment had been his fate . he was like a rare plant , torn from its native soil .

alice rose at once , and put her hand in his , they walked towards the door . the old man took no notice of them . the moon was shining brightly through the window ; but instead of stepping out into the moonlight when they opened the door . they stepped into a great beautiful hall , through the high gothic windows of which the same moon was shining . out of this hall they could find no way .
in the sweet nights of summer the children of the woods came hand in hand to the pine tree by moonlight . slipping their slim dark feet upon the moss , and tossing back their long green hair . the children of the water came by moonlight . all drenching wet their sleeves , and the bright drops fell from their finger tips . the children of the air rested in the pine tree 's branches .

`` the too— , the too— , '' shouted the maddened people . making [female] seem like an immense enclosure of bulls . and as if to make the illusion still more complete , there were not lacking people who produced cattle bells with which the faithful are called to the pagoda—the church of the chinese . he had hardly reached the window , when from the interior of the house came forth a hand . and then an arm , which , catching hold of him firmly by the neck .
the prince , charmed with these words , and much more with the manner in which they were spoken . knew not how to show his joy and gratitude ; he assured her that he loved her better than he did himself . their discourse was not very connected , but they were the better pleased , for where there is much love there is little eloquence . he was more at a loss than she . and we need not wonder at it ; she had had time to think of what to say to him .
this , fortunately , is an exceptional case , yet it is certain that many a man is today holding a position far below that for which he really has ability . simply because he is too bashful to assert himself , dreading not so much the increased responsibilities of more remunerative work as the fact that it will bring him more conspicuously and intimately into the view of other people . he feels in his soul , poor fellow . that the result will be to plunge him into unendurable confusion . it is an ordeal too great for him to face .
the lad was deceived by her artful words and told her the secret of the cap . a banquet was given to the lad , poisonous wine was served to him . and the cap being taken from him he was expelled from the house , with disgrace . he came back to bagdad , begging his way . he had no heart to go again to his mother .
so [male] got him to horse , and away he rode upon his [male] . obedient to his lord 's commands . he spared not his good beast , he rode straight . and was not afraid of the steep mountain passes nor of the enemies ', country . ere he had been three days upon the road the autumn tempest burst .
the old magician was compelled to follow him , and they pushed out into a great storm of snow . and hail , and wind , which had come on over night . and neither the wind , the hail , nor the snow . had the slightest respect for the bare limbs of the old magician . for there was not the least virtue of magic in those parts of old [male] 's body .
as the two young warriors saw him tearing down upon them . they said to each other : `` we must not let him escape alive , '' and they attacked him from the right and from the left with sword and with lance . but the all powerful [male] was not to be easily beaten -- he whirled his iron [male] round like a great water wheel . and for a long time they fought thus , neither side gaining nor losing .
`` it is the wind singing , daddy , '' cried [female] , clapping her hands with joy . `` singing a kite song to both of us , '' sometimes , to teach his little darling a lesson if she had been the least naughty . mr. [female] would fasten queerly twisted scraps of paper . on which were written many chinese words , to the string of her favourite kite .
he set out , and as he crossed the potato field . came in sight of the castle , whose windows were ablaze with light . that seemed to turn the russet leaves , still clinging to the crabtree branches , into gold . halting in the grove at one side of the ruin . he listened to the elfin revelry , and the laughter and singing made him all the more determined to proceed .
`` oh , i will manage all that , '' said the king 's son . and swinging himself to a lower branch , he bade his slave go quickly into the town . and bring back with him four strong men and a curtained litter . when the man was gone , the girl climbed down , and hid herself on the ground in some bushes . very soon the slave returned with the litter , which was placed on the ground close to the bushes where the girl lay .
he took leave of his host and started for home . when the day for the feast came , fin and the chief men of the fenians of erin set out for the castle of fear [male] . they went , a glen at a step . a hill at a leap , and thirty two miles at a running leap . till they came to the grand castle where the feast was to be given .
i can not take upon myself to say that he was always happy now , who is ? or that he had no cares ; just show me the person who is quite free from them ! but whenever people worried and bothered him -- as they did sometimes . with state etiquette , state squabbles . and the like , setting up themselves and pulling down their neighbors -- he would take refuge in that upper room which looked out on the beautiful mountains .
but to all this i gave my consent ; i could afford it well . and i liked to please my wife and daughters . the ball was given , and this house warming ended in house breaking . for just before the supper quadrille , as it was termed , when about twenty-four young ladies and gentlemen were going the grand ronde . a loud noise below , with exclamations and shrieks .
all this while , [male] lay in shackles and [male] . and melancholy possessed him by reason of that whereinto he had fallen of that tribulation . then , when troubles waxed on him and affliction was prolonged . he fell sick of a sore sickness . when the cook saw his plight ( and indeed he was like to perish for much suffering ) .
from time to time some young gallant would dash in to prod the [male] monster . and at once backwater again into the ranks of his friends . the crab bore his torment with a [male] born of the knowledge that each minute his new carapace was hardening . the shrimps had no wit to count the cost . or reckon the odds that the rising tide might bear them away in safety from the day of vengeance .
as it was never cold in the kingdom of mo there was . of course , no ice for skating , but [location] was composed of sugar syrup . and the sun had candied the surface of the lake . so it had become solid enough to skate on , and was , moreover , as smooth as glass . it was not often the king allowed skating there , for he feared some one might break through the crust .
`` that 's the very thing for me to try , '' says [male] and so . without burning any more daylight , he kissed his mother . curled his club at the little boys , and off he set along the yalla highroad to the town of [location] . at last [male] came to one of the city gates . and the guards laughed and cursed at him instead of letting him in .
a wretched little sparrow , who twittered helplessly from time to time . and then hid her head ashamed at having been betrayed into such an exhibition of weakness in public . an owl , who , living habitually in the barn , regarded the others with suspicion as intruders . and possibly thieves ; and , lastly , two [female] japanese birds . who had lived all the summer on the ornamental lake in the garden .
they turned and again rushed at him , but suddenly a flight of arrows darkened the air . several buffaloes fell dead upon the plain , and the king was wounded . these arrows were shot by a band of hunters who had come to this plain in search of game . and had hidden themselves in a thicket , from there they had seen [male] race with the buffaloes . though the king was wounded , he would still have pursued [male] .
thenolaf knew what to do , he went home , and there was the church . all ready except the very top of the weather cock , and the [male] was just putting the finishing touch to that . thenolaf called out to him , oh , ho , wind and weather . you have set the spire crooked , and then , with a great noise . the [female] fell down from the steeple and broke into pieces .
here a poor [male] passing by picked it up and put it in his wallet . but by this time [male] had got his mouth clear of the batter . and he began holloaing , and making such a to do , that the [male] , even more frightened than [male] 's mother had been . threw the pudding in the road , and ran away as fast as he could run . luckily for [male] , this second fall broke the pudding string and he was able to creep out .
then all the kings sons were uneasy , and anxious to know who was she that lost the shoe . and they began to travel all over erin to know could they find her . the prince of emania and all the others went in a great company together . and made the round of erin ; they went everywhere . north , south , east , and west .
the princess prepared the dish of pottage . composed of various minerals , herbs , and perfumes . and when it was ready the old woman took it to the sultan 's palace . the guards and eunuchs inquired what she had brought , when she said . a dish of pottage , which i request you will present to the sultan .
so the youth went on board the ship . steered steadily to the right , and never stopped once till he came to the mountain . there the forty peris were walking on the sea shore . and when they saw the ship they all came rushing up that they might examine the beautiful thing . the queen of the peris asked the little fowler whether he would not show her the ship .
the gods went to the stranger and they told him that if the last stone was not laid on the wall on the first day of the summer not sol or mani . the sun and the moon , nor [male] would be given him . and now they knew that the stranger was one of the giants . the giant and his great horse piled up the wall more quickly than before . at night , while the giant slept .
the queen mother of the west gathers the immortals around her . and gives them to eat of the peaches of long life . and then they come to her with wagons with purple canopies . drawn by flying dragons , ordinary mortals sink in the weak river when they try to cross . but she was kindly disposed to king mu .
a real bed was very comfortable after having lain on the ground in the forest for so many nights . they were so excited with the strange palace and the wonderful [male] 's ark that they could not sleep . so they talked for a long time—at least , [male] and [male] talked . but prince [male] shut his eyes and tried to sleep , his brothers voices kept him awake , and by degrees the bed which had seemed so comfortable grew harder and harder .
the railway extension to [male] had been opened on the first . the organizer rubbed his hands as he told them the glad news . we can have a dining car and sleeping berths now to within sixteen miles odd of the ruins . we sha not need to fare so ruggedly after all , a lunch at the `` apes and peacocks '' hotel is about the worst of it , but we can take out a fortnum and [organization] hamper in the road car that meets us .
[female] was never lonely after prince came , even at night they stayed together . and in the winter [male] would put his arms about his friend 's shaggy neck and sleep close beside him to keep warm . the winters are very cold in the country where [male] lived . the winds whistle through the pine trees , and the snow comes down for days . till the valleys are as white as the mountain tops , few travellers go to the mountains then .
on the third day after the old woman 's departure a young prince . hunting in the forest , got separated from his companions , and completely lost , weary of seeking his way . he flung himself down under a tree . leaving his horse to browse at will , and fell asleep , the sun had set when he awoke and began once more to try and find his way out of the forest . at last he perceived a narrow foot path , which he eagerly followed and found that it led him to a small hut .
when night had set in , the prince was conducted to an open plain in front of the palace . in the centre of which was a large reservoir full of clear water . which the sultan commanded him to drain off before sunrise . or forfeit his life , the prince remained alone on the brink of the reservoir with rather somewhat more hope of success than he had felt of overcoming his task of the preceding night . nor was he disappointed , for about midnight a voice was heard exclaiming .
svadilföri , you must remember , had been working hard all winter . with never a sight of four footed creature of his kind . and he was very lonesome and tired of dragging stones , giving a snort of disobedience . off he ran after this new friend toward the grassy meadows . off went the giant after him , howling with rage .
seven years later , in the international studio , [female] , 1901 . we read : the mention of style suggests a reference to the portraits by miss [female] . while the allusion to characterization suggests at the same time their limitation . the oftener one sees her `` mother and daughter , '' which gained the gold medal at [location] in 1899 and the gold medal also at last year 's [location] exposition .
when he reached his home he told his mother that he had again seen the lovely girl . and that this time she had been even more beautiful than the night before . and again the bear smiled beneath the table , and muttered : i have taken him in a second time . and he has no idea that i am the beautiful girl with whom he is so much in love . when the ball was over , he followed her carriage .
when [female] opened her eyes and saw her two brothers and her sister [female] over her . she thanked heaven for her deliverance . with a sword all dripping red one brother pointed towards the porch . and [female] gave a deep sigh of relief . she knew , and was satisfied to know , she was a widow .
this time poor master [male] fell down as if he had been struck by lightning . when he at last opened his eyes he found himself seated on the floor . his face was changed , even the end of his nose . instead of being [male] , as it was nearly always , had become blue from fright . `` come in , '' said the carpenter , without having the strength to rise to his feet .
this was enough to scare [male] himself , the dragon threw down the sacks . and then took to flight , so frightened that since that time he has never dared to come back to the world . once upon a time , something happened , if it had not happened . it would not be told , there was a good , pious emperor , who had three sons . among many other benefits bestowed upon the inhabitants of his empire he built a church .
when he had come down again from the tree with the apple . he would not climb over the fence , but grasped the great gate . and had no need to shake it more than once before it sprang open with a loud crash . then he went out , and the lion which had been lying down before , was awake and sprang after him . not in rage and fierceness , but following him humbly as its master .
[female] was so furious at the man 's words that he felled him to the earth with a blow from his sword . while for a moment the other guards stood mute from surprise . then seizing their weapons they rushed at [male] . who sat firm in his saddle as became a knight . awaiting their onslaught , but for all his [male] it would have gone hard with him had not the attention of the soldiers been hastily called off by the galley slaves .
he returned adorned with the emperor 's costly golden chain . young , handsome , joyous and richly clad , he returned home . and knew well how to relate the magnificence and charms of foreign lands . young and old listened to him with admiration , but young [male] most of all . through him the world in her eyes became twice as large .
the boy comprehended that they were far north , as the procession grew thinner and thinner . the rye blade , the barley . the wild strawberry , the blueberry [male] . the pea stalk , the currant [male] had come along as far as this . the elk and the domestic cow had been walking side by side .
he tried to be as careful as possible in filling the flask ; but , notwithstanding all his care . the top joint of his little finger touched the water . and in an instant became gold , however , he had his flask full of sparkling golden water . the flask itself now , of course . golden , and he felt that the top joint of his little finger was a small price to pay for all this .
in [male] , lot examines the question in the light of our tale . he points out that it indicates clearly the superhuman nature of the mother . and that as the silver chains figure in the story . they can not be due in the continental versions to contamination with the swan knight saga . as m. [male] paris imagines .
and she gazed at the horizon , and however much she gazed . she always saw more , close by were the green valleys , dotted with grazing sheep . soft meadows with fat cattle , waving corn fields . canals covered with ships , and the cottage roofs of a village . farther away were lines of woods , hill tops , mountain ridges .
as soon as the fairy queen had finished speaking . the little elves to whom she had given special directions set off without any delay to obey her orders . while the rest scattered themselves in every direction through the forest . each following the pursuit which seemed best to him , arrived there , they walked quietly up to the door . which opened to them without any of the people inside knowing that it had done so .
but the fanciful have asserted that the whisky , brandy , and rum seemed always to stand at the same level . poetry was there : the left hand corner of the room was lined with as complete a set of english classics as the right hand could show of english and foreign physiologists . but if one took a volume of [male] or [male] from that rank . its absence irritated the mind like a gap in a man 's front teeth . one could not say the books were never read ; probably they were , but there was a sense of their being chained to their places .
it would require diplomacy in order that [male] esserson might not become alarmed and flee . he was an odd sort of man who was afraid of children . he used to say that the sight of them made him so melancholy that he could not endure it . while [female] serka deliberated , [female] , the goose girl . and [female] , the young lapp boy who had stared so hard at her the night before .
never had he seen any one so wonderfully beautiful , and he could not but look at her . for she was more lovely than any human being as she shone in her own soft [female] . when princess moonlight became aware that a stranger was looking at her she tried to escape from the room . but the emperor caught her and begged her to listen to what he had to say . her only answer was to hide her face in her sleeves .
we took a saw and several nails . and water in the nursery pails ; and [female] said . `` let america also take an apple and a slice of cake , '' which was enough for [male] and me to go a sailing on , till tea . we sailed along for days and days .
on the next day he went on further with them . and at last he came to a place exceedingly grassy , in a green glen . of which he never saw the like , he drew the great clean sweeping sword . and he neared the giant , the herd drew back his sword . and the head was off the giant in a twinkling .
after a while the lad grew hot with his work , he looked about him . and he saw nobody , so he whipped off his wig to wipe his forehead . and then he was as handsome a lad as ever was seen . so that the princess 's heart turned right over at the sight of him . then he put on his wig and became ugly again , and went on spading .
a shrill blast outside her door sent a twinge of pain through the queen 's head . which by this time was aching badly ; but in her joy at welcoming her future husband she paid no heed to it . between two lines of courtiers , bowing low , the young king advanced quickly . but at the sight of the queen and her bandages . broke out into such violent fits of laughter that he was forced to leave the room .
pat diver , the [male] . was a man well accustomed to a wandering life , and to strange shelters . he had shared the beggar 's blanket in smoky cabins . he had crouched beside the still in many a nook and corner where poteen was made on the wild innishowen mountains . he had even slept on the bare heather .
while all these exciting things were happening to the poor scarecrow , [male] , sir [male] and the cowardly lion had been having adventures of their own . for three days , they had wandered through a deserted part of the winkie country . subsisting largely on berries , sleeping under trees , and looking in vain for a road to lead them back to the [male] city . on the second day , they had encountered an ancient woodsman . too old and deaf to give them any information .
now as a good mussulman the merchant was forbidden to refuse this choice of a judge . so he accepted the test , and said to [male] . `` very well ; i should like nothing better , we shall soon see which of [location] is in the right . '' so the two men presented themselves before the cadi . and [male] again repeated his tale , the cadi asked what witnesses he had .
but [female] 's heart sadly misgave him because of his grandfather . and he very , very nearly changed his mind on the threshold and stayed beside him . but he forced himself to do as he had made up his mind to . and went out and away into the hills , so [male] went off to the hills . very downcast and sad ; and when he came to the first rock , lo and behold .
on leaving the chapel , i cordially thanked my friend for the information he had imparted respecting the [male] legend . and told him , that some day i would try to make his name and his [organization] as immortal as the saint whose history he had so eloquently told . but before my tale sees the light , my entertainer has gone to that bourne from whence no traveller returns . yet it may be , —who knows ? —that his spirit still visits our world . and communes with dear ones and friends left behind .
i knocked at the door , and presently two little female slaves . white as snow , and neatly dressed came and opened it , `` be pleased to come in , sir , '' said they , our [male] expects you impatiently . these two days she has talked of nothing but you . i entered the court , and saw a pavilion raised seven steps .
insomuch that when we were yet new to the property ( m. loyal always speaks of it as `` la propriété '' ) we went three miles straight on end in search of the bridge of austerlitz—which we afterwards found to be immediately outside the window . the château of the old guard , in another part of the grounds . and , according to the plan , about two leagues from the little dining room . we sought in vain for a week .
i was too much dazzled by her beauty to dream of refusing her offer . and accordingly the princess had me conducted to the bath . and a rich dress befitting my rank was provided for me . then a feast of the most delicate dishes was served in a room hung with embroidered indian fabrics . next day , when we were at dinner .
he got off his horse and knocked at the door . a poor old man opened it , and a poor old woman also came forward . they appeared very much astonished to see such a fine , handsome young knight , the prince . after wishing them good evening , said that he had lost his way . and that he had been riding through the wood all day long without coming to a dwelling of any kind .
nina , with blushing and tears . had confessed to her that for two years she had been in love . when she uttered the name of the man she loved [male] had pushed her away so abruptly that the poor little thing had fallen against a piece of furniture . the `` nun '' remembered her mad fit of anger ; without being touched by her sister 's sobs . she shut herself in her room .
`` well , come with me then , and i will show you your bed . '' he went , and the giant put the king 's son into the deep tank of water to drown . and being tired himself from hunting all day over the mountains and hills of erin . he went to sleep , that minute his youngest daughter came , took the king 's son out of the tank . placed plenty to eat and to drink before him , and gave him a good bed to sleep on that night .
`` the pearls , '' said [female] , after a kind greeting . to which her palsied tongue refused a response , she gave them to him with a [male] hand . and , as he pressed the secret spring , the golden casket opened . and there lay the wonderful moorish pearls , pure and white as snow . and large and shining as the dew drops in the flush of morning .
the horse entered a wide extended plain , and trotted on steadily the whole day without finding a single house . master and beast began almost to faint with hunger . and prince wish might have wished himself safe at home again . had he not discovered , just at dusk , a cavern . where there sat , beside a bright lantern , a little woman who might have been more than a hundred years old .
the children gathered round the curious object on the beach . none of them had ever seen such a funny old gum boot . and surely none of them had ever seen such a funny little oyster . they tore the pale , knotted little thing from her foster mother . and handled her with such rough curiosity that even had she been a robust oyster she must certainly have died .
on and on flew prince [male] from the wicked uncle who meant to do him harm . the words of the faithful old [male] were strongly impressed upon his mind . and he realized that the duke had designs on his life . when it was discovered that he was missing , a search would be made for him . and once in the power of the duke it would go hard with him .
alas , there was but the tiniest crust of bread to be found . and the littlest crumb of cheese , suddenly , as he fished about in the sack . the grenadier discovered the little green wand , he had quite forgotten it . a notion came into his head to try the magic . and he struck the bit of bread one smart tap .
when the two sisters returned , they were full of this strange adventure . how the beautiful lady had appeared at the ball more beautiful than ever , and enchanted everyone who looked at her . and how as the clock was striking twelve she had suddenly risen up and fled through the ballroom . disappearing no one knew how or where , and dropping one of her glass slippers behind her in her flight . how the king 's son had remained inconsolable , until he chanced to pick up the little glass slipper .
ans. , then , whether you or i , [person] , live to hail that glorious orb . must now be tried , [person] , to your guard , whate'er the issue . you will repent this most ungovern would haste , till we had measured swords . honour forbade it , now manifest , i give you life . and proffer , if that you please , my hand in amity .
the three hunters had a long time to wait , at last they heard a rustling . whirring sound above them , and a large hovering object darkened the air . two guns were ready to aim at the dark body of the [organization] as it rose from the nest . then a shot was fired ; for an instant the bird fluttered its wide spreading wings . and seemed as if it would fill up the whole of the chasm .
gothic architecture and decoration declined from the [person] of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries to the over decorated . flamboyant gothic of the fifteenth century , and it was in the latter period that the transition began between the gothic and the [organization] epochs . the [organization] was at its height in [person] in the fifteenth century . and its influence began to make itself felt a little in [person] at that time . when the french under [person] seized [person] , the magnificence of the court of [person] sforza .
the division of the world being now satisfactorily arranged , it would seem that all things ought to have gone on smoothly . but such was not the case , trouble arose in an unlooked for quarter . the giants , those hideous monsters who had sprung from the earth and the blood of [female] . declared war against the triumphant deities of olympus . and a struggle ensued , which , in consequence of [female] having made these children of hers invincible as long as they kept their feet on the ground .
he tucked the pedestal under his arm . and they started back down the road together , it was very lovely to be trudging along under the late clear sky . through the sweet smelling pollen dust , and now and then meeting the sunset sheep . who , by this time , had found their little lambs , when they got back to the garden . and stood in front of the gate through which [male] had entered .
so they reached the ballroom , and immediately the dance ceased . even the music fainted away as this vision of beauty came upon the scene . all was at a silent standstill as the prince led the unknown down the hall . and nothing could be heard but whispers of `` ah ! how beautiful she is ! '' and `` never , never have i seen such loveliness , '' even the old king was altogether fascinated .
the dwarf could not refuse this request , and so they all went together through the beautiful green paths and flowery meadows . and came at last to the river which flowed for miles round the princess 's land and formed the boundary of her kingdom . there was no bridge or ferryboat to be seen anywhere , and it was impossible to get over to the other side . for the boldest swimmer would not have dared to brave the fierce current and roaring waters . then the youth said to the dwarf : `` give me your wand in order that i may part the waves . ''
so [male] pressed his own suit , he was not a bad looking fellow . and knew well also how to honey his speech , moreover , he believed in paving his way with offerings of flowers . trinkets , sweetmeats , fin fan looked . listened , and accepted , every gift that could be kept was carefully put by in a trunk which she hoped some day to take to [location] . they will help to furnish [female] 's home , ', said she .
all three jumped to their feet , i sat calmly , at a look from the prince . his daughter and the courteous stranger sat down again , they were both very pale . his command of himself was superb , he began to talk lightly on indifferent subjects . and as he talked his voice became gradually more distant , and i grew drowsy . i knew i was falling asleep , i remember nothing more until i awoke the next morning in my own bed .
you see , they did not know that the tailor had only killed flies . they took it to mean men . he jogged along for some miles until he came to a hedge . where a little bird was caught in the branches , `` come along , '' said the tailor . i will have you to keep my cheese company ', .
by this time it was nearly dark , and the father said they could travel no further that night . and must go to sleep where they were , [female] was thankful indeed when she heard this . for she was very tired , and found the two skins fastened round her almost too heavy to carry . so , in spite of her dread of the ogre . she slept till dawn , when her father woke her .
the glad earth re echoed her martial shout ; the billowy sea became agitated . and [male] , the sun god , arrested his fiery steeds in their headlong course to welcome this wonderful emanation from the godhead . [female] was at once admitted into the assembly of the gods . and henceforth took her place as the most faithful and sagacious of all her father 's counsellors . this brave , dauntless [male] .
after listening attentively to the whole adventure , the fairy asked for time to consult her books . after due consideration she informed the prince that the object of his search was not far distant . but that it was too difficult for him to attempt to enter the enchanted palace where she was . as the king his father had surrounded it with a thick cloud . and that the only expedient she could think of would be to gain possession of the princess 's parrot .
they both rowed as hard as they could night and day . and their little boat went so quickly that they reached the old king before the other two did . he was much astonished to see them come back alone , and asked what had happened to them . when he heard the wickedness of his daughter . he said , i can not believe that she has acted so wrongly .
its top glittered in the evening rays like molten gold . and it seemed as if the light came from within it . for long after the sun had sunk beneath the horizon , the mountain top would glow in the clear , blue sky . the white aquatic birds skimmed the surface of the water in their flight . and all was calm and still as amid the black rocks at [female] , i lay on my back in the boat .
after awhile , in came a man with four hunting dogs . clad in various kinds of silk and brocade and having on their necks collars of gold with chains of silver . and tied up each dog in a place set apart for him . after which he went out and presently returned with four dishes of gold . full of rich meats , one of which he set before each dog .
the whole company were listening to the story with breathless attention . when it became plain that dely could go no further , while [female] had flung herself on a heap of cushions and hidden her face . [female] ordered her women to give them all the attention possible . and desired they should be carried into her own rooms , when the two sisters were in this condition . [male] , who was a very prudent young man , suggested to his parents that .
so [male] sharpened his big broadsword , and [male] carefully prepared his master 's horse . so that before an hour had passed they were galloping toward the province of [organization] of dawna . prince marvel knew little concerning this personage , but [male] had much to tell of him . [organization] had once been page to a wise scholar and magician . who lived in a fine old castle in dawna and ruled over a large territory .
a mouse and a frog struck up a friendship . they were not well mated , for the mouse lived entirely on land . while the frog was equally at home on land or in the water . in order that they might never be separated , the frog tied himself and the mouse together by the leg with a piece of thread . as long as they kept on dry land all went fairly well ; but , coming to the edge of a pool .
nevertheless , because she was his godmother , and had given him the cloak . he folded it carefully and put it away . poor and shabby as it was , hiding it in a safe corner of his top cupboard . which his nurse never meddled with , he did not want her to find it . or to laugh at it or at his godmother .
i had always regarded as fabulous what i had heard sailors and others relate of the valley of diamonds . and of the stratagems employed by merchants to obtain jewels from thence . but now i found that they had stated nothing but the truth . for the fact is that the merchants come to the neighborhood of this valley . when the eagles have young ones , and throwing great joints of meat into the valley .
so the cat ran after the women and when they began to cut up the fish . it kept mewing round them , they threw one or two scraps to it . but it only sniffed at them and would not eat them . then they began to wonder what on earth the cat wanted . and at last they threw the stomach to it .
he was disappointed when [male] delivered the message . and going up stairs opened the door of their sleeping apartment . but [female] 's eyes were closed , and fearful of disturbing her . he quietly returned to the parlour and endeavoured to amuse himself with a book until his usual hour of going to rest . the next morning all seemed as usual ; for sleep has a renovating power on the mind as well as the body .
on a border land between games and sweets are the stalls of the itinerant batter sellers . at these the tiny purchaser enjoys the evidently much appreciated privilege of himself arranging his little measure of batter in fantastic forms . and drying them upon a hot metal plate . a turtle is a favorite design , as the first blotch of batter makes its body . and six judiciously arranged smaller dabs soon suggest its head , tail , and feet .
nor knew we , of the days that fleeted over us . the present from the past , for very joy 's excess . fair fall all those that love of ease and twinned delight . and joy to them fulfil its promise none the less ! ne'er may they know the taste of parting 's bitter cup !
but now they had to contrive something , so that [male] could carry [male] . because [male] himself had nothing . [male] took out a tiny seed pearl , threw it down . and lo , before their eyes there grew a little basket . just as big as [male] , and the basket had a loop attached .
meantime , [female] missed her silent swain , whose absence tended materially to strengthen the feeling of affection which she entertained for him . day after day crept on , yet he came not . and each long hour of watching riveted still more closely her heart 's fetters . now , for the first time , she acknowledged to herself how essential he was to her happiness . and with a fervent prayer that the coming morning might bring him to her side .
it was an account of a voyage to the moon . in which there is a great deal of information about matters not generally known . for few travellers have been to the moon , in that book . prince [male] fancied he would find something he half remembered . and that would be of use to him , and he did !
taubennest was a fine old castle in its way . but certainly not at all comparable to king [male] 's palace . and as for the city , it was a thing altogether beyond [male] 's conceptions . such a labyrinth of streets and houses ! such crowds of people passing and repassing , such strange , unaccustomed sights and sounds !
i wish especially to acknowledge the courtesy of those who have given me photographs of their pictures and sculpture . to be used as illustrations , of the army of women artists of the last century it is not yet possible to speak with judgment and justice . although many have executed works of which all women may be proud , we have some knowledge of women artists in ancient days . few stories of that time are so authentic as that of [person] . who made the design for the first bas relief , in the city of sicyonia .
on this elegant couch lay prince rainbow . looking more beautiful than ever , and sunk in profound slumber , in which he had been held ever since his disappearance . fairy than a fairy , who now saw him for the first time in his real shape . hardly dared to gaze at him , fearing lest his appearance might not be in keeping with the voice and language which had won her heart . at the same time she could not help feeling rather hurt at the apparent indifference with which she was received .
in midgard , in a northern kingdom , a king reigned whose name was [male] . he was wise and good , and he had in his house a fosterson whose name was [male] . [male] was fearless and strong ; so fearless and so strong was he that he once captured a bear of the forest and drove him to the king 's hall . his mother 's name was [male] . once , before [male] was born , [male] and his father who was king before him went on an expedition across the sea and came into another country .
the house—a wee , wee cot house—has one little window in the end directed to the burn . and therein sits a cat , winking with listless satisfaction under the glow of the summer scene . there , too , sits a curched grandame working her stocking , rejoicing in the genial warmth which seldom comes so far up the glen . thinking , it may be , of the days when she was full of young life . or of the trials she has undergone since then .
now it so happened that the three princes , in their search for their sisters . chanced to rest at an inn on one of the high roads ; and , when they had finished supper . they fell into conversation with an interesting stranger . a courtly man of cities , with manners that are only learnt in kings ', palaces . he begged to be allowed to call for wine , -- which in those days was no offence .
at my return , i enquired for the mother and child . your slave , said she , is dead ; and as for your son . i know not what is become of him , i have not seen him this two months . i was afflicted at the death of the slave . but as she informed me my son had only disappeared .
the time to see the yoshiwara to the best advantage is just after nightfall . when the lamps are lighted , then it is that the women . who for the last two hours have been engaged in gilding their lips and painting their eyebrows black . and their throats and bosoms a snowy white , carefully leaving three brown van dyke collar points where the back of the head joins the neck . in accordance with one of the strictest rules of japanese cosmetic science .
`` then , in a flash , a monstrous woodcock swept down from above and seized the snake in its beak . '' exhausted and [male] , [male] pursued his way . the path grew steeper , the scene ever wilder , until he found his way blocked by a huge pine tree . you have not quite hit it , [male] ; but as it is yourself . we will let it pass , said a soft clear voice close by him .
this was the first time , since his little playmate had come to dwell with him . that he had attempted to enjoy any pleasure in which she did not partake . but nothing went right ; nor was he nearly so happy as on other days . he could not find a sweet grape or a ripe fig ( if [female] had a fault . it was a little too much fondness for figs ) , .
from hence he traveled on , and came to a great city . where , upon his arrival , he understood there was a great and solemn procession . in order to shut up a young woman against her will among the vestal nuns . the prince was touched with compassion ; and thinking the best use he could make of his cap was to redress public wrongs and relieve the oppressed . he flew to the temple , where he saw the young woman .
they sought out a hollow tree to winter in . and contrived to carry their wounded nest mate thither ; and before the rigor of the season had set in . they had , by diligence and economy . stored up food enough to carry them through the winter months . to make the provisions they had laid in last the better , it was agreed among them that two of their number should go south .
when a curse proceeds from rage or malevolence . it is at the same time a confession of impotence . the party uttering it is unable at the moment to indulge his rancour in any other way . if he had the power he would bring all the woes he threatens or imprecates there and then on his enemy 's devoted head . [male] is no element of wrath and rarely enters the house of malevolence .
it happened that at this time the chief was about to enter into a struggle with an aggressive and powerful neighbour . and on the result of this combat depended his own and clansmen 's lives . their antagonists were far superior in point of number . and were warriors renowned for their wonderful exploits—for fearlessness , daring , and courage . but they were a ruthless and relentless enemy .
he took the stone from his mouth . and drawing his sword he rushed after the giant . so as to give the lady time to escape , but hardly had he come within reach of the enemy . than the giant touched him with a ring that he held in his hand . and the prince remained immovable where he stood , the giant then hastily rejoined his prey .
suddenly with a rattle and noise the gander unbolted the door and flung it open . like a flash the [male] bounded up and into the house . he gave a glance about him . [male] was not to be seen , because she was hiding in the cupboard . but there was the plump white gander , it had flown away from the door as if in a great fright and into the cage .
it was found too tough and hard for the tools of the period . but the doctor was not to be thwarted , and insisted on harder tempered tools being found . and the task completed ; the result was the production of a candle box which was admired by every one . he then ordered a bureau of the same material . and when it was finished invited his friends to see the new work .
it was indeed for this that the two seemed to be contending , for now the one and now the other would lay his hands upon it . so did they well nigh come to blows , but the two damsels had so far hindered them from coming to this extremity . not the less were they bent on trying their cause by the sword . it seemed as if it could not be decided in any other fashion . but when they were on the point to do so , notwithstanding all that the damsels could say or do .
in the morning , when the play began , [male] fox had looked so stunning that the geese were amazed when they saw him . [male] loved display , his coat was a brilliant red . his breast white ; his nose black ; and his tail was as bushy as a plume . but when the evening of this day was come , [male] 's coat hung in loose folds . he was bathed in sweat ; his eyes were without lustre .
he found the child in the middle of the floor . weeping bitterly , and [female] slumbering peacefully in bed , the instant she saw him the night lost thing ceased her crying . smiled , and stretched out her arms to him , unwilling to wake the old woman . who had been working hard all day , he took the child . and carried her with him , she clung to him so .
on the evening before the day he had settled to return with the captain of the passage boat . ib lost himself in the streets . and took quite a different turning to the one he wished to follow . he wandered on till he found himself in a poor street of the suburb called [female] 's haven . not a creature could be seen , at last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched looking houses .
she was jarred and very sore when they showed her to the door . ( i might hit off the door that was a jar , ) to the spot she swift returned where the poet sighed and yearned . and she told him that he would gone a little far . your performance with this rhyme has made me absolutely sick , ', she remarked . `` i think the time has come to kick , '' suppose you were sitting at home .
they laid her upon the humble bed that boasted not a yard of linen . but there was a woollen coverlet , and that would keep the occupant warm , life returned to her . but she was delirious , and knew nothing of what had happened , or where she was . and it was better so , for everything she loved and valued lay buried in the sea . it was with her ship as with the vessel in the song of `` the king 's son of england . ''
many years had passed , and he was now an old man . seated with his old wife under an elder tree in full [male] . they were holding each other 's hands , just as the great-grandfather and grandmother had done . and spoke , as they did , of olden times and of the golden wedding . the little [female] with the blue eyes and with the elder blossoms in her hair sat in the tree and nodded to them and said .
the water was frozen in the pool ; and , imprisoned below it . she could see the [female] of the [female] . perfectly stiff , and looking as if she were in some sort of awful trance . the [female] , on the other hand , drooped on her accustomed branch like the leaves on the trees . as if she hardly had strength to hold her loosened plumes together .
so all three returned happily home , and the wedding was celebrated three days after . long , long ago , there lived a king who ruled over a country by the sea . when he had been married about a year , some of his subjects . inhabiting a distant group of islands , revolted against his laws . and it became needful for him to leave his wife and go in person to settle their disputes .
just then the daughters of keleos , the king of eleusis . came to the fountain with pitchers on their heads to draw water . and when they saw [female] , they knew from her face that she must have some great grief . and they spoke kindly to her , and asked if they could do anything to help her . then she told them how she had lost and was searching for her child .
i give no ear to what you say , said the prince . in an angry and high tone ; i must know of you absolutely what is become of the lady . and if you scruple to obey me , i am in a place where i shall soon be able to force you to tell me . at these stern words the grand vizier began to be under greater confusion than before . and was thinking how he could in the best manner get away , he endeavoured to pacify the prince by good words .
the princess sent regularly for seven mornings successively a dish of pottage . and the sultan as regularly presented her adopted mother with a purse of deenars . for such was the rapidity of his recovery , that at the expiration of the sixth day he was perfectly well . and on the seventh he mounted his horse and repaired to his country palace to make the absolution of health and enjoy the fresh air . during her visits he had questioned the old lady concerning her adopted daughter .
so [female] mounted again in high glee , and carried his sword in his hand . and went prepared to tarry upon the other side , but while he was bethinking himself what great words to use . when he should arrive thither , he felt himself slipping from the friar 's broad back . he clutched frantically to save himself but had too round a surface to grasp . besides being hampered by his weapon , so down went he with a loud splash into the middle of the stream .
soon afterward the false bride said to the young king : dearest husband . i beg you to do me a favor . he answered : i will do so most willingly , then send for the knacker . and have the head of the horse on which i rode here cut off . for it vexed me on the way .
the road from [location] to leipsic , at the time of our story . ran in one part close to a deep hollow . through which a clear brook wound its way , the stream flowed directly from [location] . and had the [person] property , that whatever fell into it instantly became alive . provided only that it had previously had the form of some living thing .
apollo lost no time , a shaft from his quiver flew . as flies a bolt from the hand of [male] . and the first born of [male] fell , like a young pine broken by the wind . on the floor of his winning chariot , his brother . who followed him , went on the heels of his comrade swiftly down to the shades .
there was a great mystery attaching to the palace and its occupants . and although the servants of the white cat were to all appearances human beings . still , as they were deaf and dumb . and would not , or could not , understand signs , the neighbours had not been able to discover the secret or mystery . the palace was a noble building , after the style of the alcazar at toledo .
the result of all these researches was a history of the province during the reign of the dutch governors . which he published some years since , there have been various opinions as to the literary character of his work . and , to tell the truth , it is not a whit better than it should be . its chief merit is its scrupulous accuracy , which indeed was a little questioned on its first appearance . but has since been completely established ; and it is now admitted into all historical collections .
now it so happened that a sleeping jinn dwelt at the bottom of the well . he could only be awakened by a spell , and although rosy red did not know it . the words she uttered , which she had once heard her granny use . were the spell , the jinn awoke . and he was so delighted with the sweet voice that he promptly decided to help the girl whom he saw peering down into the water .
while [female] took these measures to prevent the public from knowing how he came by his riches in so short a time . the captain of the forty robbers returned to the forest with inconceivable mortification . and in his agitation , or rather confusion , at his ill success . so contrary to what he had promised himself , entered the cave . not being able , all the way from the town , to come to any resolution how to revenge himself of [male] .
and so the rich brother went trotting home , crying with pain . while little master [male] sat firmly on his shoulders . pulling at his hair , `` you seem to have bought a good deal with the gold , '' he said , looking at the merchant 's house . `` we will see how far it will go , '' and every day he rode the rich merchant to the tavern .
thereupon the father grew very angry at [male] and his love for him changed to hatred . and one day he spoke to a robber and promised him much money if he would take [male] away into the forest and kill him there and bring back his heart to show that he had done what he had promised . but instead of doing this the robber told [male] all about it and advised him to flee away . while the robber took back to [male] 's father the heart of a deer saying that it was [male] 's . then [male] travelled on and on till one night he stopped at a castle on the way .
`` 'ting ting , '' and the little iron chandelier suddenly rose at least half a yard and disappeared in the tub . and that was the sign that the play was going to begin , a young nobleman and his lady . who happened to be passing through the little town , were present at the performance . and consequently the house was crowded , but under the chandelier was a vacant space like a little crater . not a single soul sat there , for the tallow was dropping , drip , drip !
but life was not all condensed milk and honey to [male] . like all good minders and men , he had the bad fortune to arouse the jealousy of rivals . the unvarying success which met his clever treatment of the most difficult cases . instead of arousing the admiration of his brother minders . as one would have expected , and making them eager to imitate him , only had the effect of making them very cross and jealous .
`` down to my child , '' she repeated ; and a despairing supplication spoke out of her words . a corner of the cloak was removed , and she stood in a great hall which spread wide and pleasantly around . it was twilight , but in a moment her child appeared . and was pressed to her heart , smiling at her in greater beauty than he had ever possessed . she uttered a cry , but it was inaudible .
we will kill you , [male] and [male] answered come and see who will do the killing . so they began to fight and the raja 's men fired their guns at [male] and [male] till they were tired of shooting . and had used up all their powder and shot , but they never hit them . then [male] and [male] called out `` now it is our turn ! '' and when the raja 's men saw that [male] and [male] had nothing but a drum they said `` yes , it is your turn . ''
then they began to ponder and meditate , and then they glanced at the ceiling . and then they stared at the walls , and then they fixed their eyes upon the floor . but they could not give him any answer . nor could the king himself , although he was much more learned than all the others together . they had to give it up , and the lad got the princess and half the kingdom .
jesper stared round him in bewilderment . and having nothing better to do with his hands , thrust them into his pockets . as he was in the habit of doing , here he found something which turned out to be the whistle given to him by the old woman . he remembered what she had said about the virtues of the whistle . but was rather doubtful whether its powers would extend to a hundred hares , each of which had gone in a different direction and might be several miles distant by this time .
but as the time went by there came great sadness in the northland kingdom . the good king [male] laid him down to sleep one night and never waked again . all folk both high and low mourned deeply , for good king [male] had been like a kindly father rather than a king . when at last the time of mourning passed , lord [male] . cousin to king [male] .
at last the house was done , and it was snug , and warm , and comfortable . `` 't is good to travel east and west , but , after all , a home is best , '' said the sheep , and they lived together until cold weather came . when they put up a stove to keep warm . and they planned to enjoy the long winter , now , not far off from the house lived the wolf and his family .
perseus shrieked , and ran up to him ; but when they lifted the old man up he was dead . for his life was slow and feeble , then he told them how the prophecy had declared that he should kill his grandfather . and all the story of his life , so they made a great mourning for [male] . and burnt him on a right rich pile ; and [male] went to the temple . and was purified from the guilt of the death , because he had done it unknowingly .
but all day he searched the world for her . the earth , mortified by this outrage to her hospitality . tried to help him , her granddaughters , the mermaids . had sought information from every part of the globe . but as yet without success , the moon princess had disappeared from the face of the earth completely .
at the shore of the beautiful blue sea the faithful spirits lowered their burden . there [female] and her fairy husband rest beneath the flowers of this paradise . and beside the [female] of the waves , on the branches of the cypress that grows on their grave hangs the fairy king 's harp . the hand is cold that once touched its chords ; but when the morning breeze sweeps through them . they sound as of old in magic melody , the sweet notes float on the sunbeams through the evergreen paradise .
this reflection plunged her into a profound reverie . but a second stroke of the bell warned them that it was time to separate . they descended into the court , where the father found two horses . the one loaded with the two trunks , and the other destined for himself , the latter . covered with a good cloak , and the saddle having two bags attached to it full of refreshments .
though the engine was old and out of repair , it had one redeeming feature . it could throw two or three streams of water at once as well as one . and the brownies in their great need forced it to the limit . immense volumes of water gushed out at the lava . and their contact produced a hissing , boiling sound .
prince [male] was found by some other sailors upon the island . and carried to this convent , where he was placed in [male] 's hospital and there he remained for more than a month . but did not recognize [female] , for her face was concealed by a black veil . and [female] wept every day . one day [male] came to the hospital .
up at the palace the queen and the ladies in waiting to the queen and the princess regarded all this as but another sign of poor [female] 's strangeness . from her tower window the queen peered anxiously down at her daughter toiling away at sunrise . so at last prince [male] turned sadly back toward the palace of the princess . it was already late at night when the prince found himself in the neighbourhood of the palace . and being tired and travel worn , he resolved to take shelter in the cup of some flower and wait until the palace revelries were done .
aladdin had conducted himself in this manner several years . when the african magician , who had for some years dismissed him from his recollection . determined to inform himself with certainty whether he perished . as he supposed , in the subterranean cave or not , after he had resorted to a long course of magic ceremonies . and had formed a horoscope by which to ascertain [male] 's fate .
she showed him the shadow . and told him how glad she was to have such a treasure as nana for a nurse . `` you see how very useful nana is , '' concluded mrs . [female] , as the faithful dog came in with [female] 's bottle of [female] mixture . but [female] was naughty , and would not take it ; there was a fine [female] over it .
by and by he came to a garden . and there he let the fiddler drop on the soft grass below . then away he flew to attend to other matters of greater need . when the fiddler had gathered his wits together , and himself to his feet . he saw that he lay in a beautiful garden of flowers and fruit trees and marble walks and what not .
once upon a time there lived a little girl who had neither father nor mother . they both died when she was very young , and left their daughter to the care of her uncle . who was the richest farmer in all that country , he had houses and lands . flocks and herds , many servants to work about his house and fields . a wife who had brought him a great dowry .
the executioner took the young man , dressed him as he had been directed . placed him upon the camel , and led him through the city . preceded by guards and a crier , who bawled out , `` behold the merited punishment of him who has dared to violate the sanctuary of the royal haram . '' the procession was followed by an incalculable crowd of people . who were astonished at the beauty of the young man , and the little concern he seemed to feel at his own situation .
early in life i displayed an aptitude for books . and at the age of nine years was placed in a private school in [location] . remaining there until i was fourteen , after this i made regular trips with my father on all his fishing voyages . my father was a man fully six feet three in height . and weighed over fifteen stone , a typical norseman of the most rugged sort .
while she dwelt in the king 's palace . mother [male] had been so continually occupied with taking care of the young prince that her heart was a little lightened of its grief for [female] . but now , having nothing else to busy herself about , she became just as wretched as before . at length , in her despair , she came to the dreadful resolution that not a stalk of grain . nor a blade of grass , not a potato .
when king [male] heard this , he said . most like all they say of the vizier is leasing and his innocence will appear . even as that of the pious woman appeared , then he comforted the vizier 's heart and bade him go to his house . so he arose and taking his weaving gear . sold it and bought with the price drugs and simples and wrought himself a carpet .
[male] forthwith pitched on the most convenient spot the tent of blue samite fringed with gold . which he carried with him to shelter his [male] lady . whilst [male] , in the character of herald . rode over to [male] to announce to him that the beauteous [male] of [male] was present in the army of the knight [male] . and would the next morning be present as a judge of the combat .
[male] did not understand the language in which the book was printed . but the wonderful light with which the words glowed impressed them somehow on his memory . the vision shut the volume , a strain of music was heard . and [female] awoke , the sun was shining full into the green room . and somewhere not far away a girl 's voice was singing a simple scottish air .
when this was done the old woman took her daughter , and putting a cap on her . laid her in the bed in the queen 's place . she gave her , too , the form and appearance of the real queen as far as she could . but she could not restore the lost eye . and so that the king might not notice it , she turned upon that side where there was no eye .
such verses as these people write when they are in love ! but no man in his senses ever thinks of printing them . here one of the sorrows of life , in which there is real poetry . gave itself vent ; not that barren grief which the poet may only hint at . but never depict in its detail -- [male] and want .
the prince was delighted , and made ready to see the princess , but the wicked maid went at once and told the queen all that had passed . it was then arranged that [female] should take her place . and so , with great precautions , [female] placed herself at the little window . the night was very dark ; so much so that it was impossible for prince charming to suspect the change passed upon him . he expressed himself exactly the same to [male] as he had to [male] and plainly showed his love for her .
there in the middle of it was a brazen [organization] set deep in the floor and full of something that seethed and bubbled . `` i wonder what that is in the [organization] , '' said the lad to himself . and he stuck his finger in , when he drew it out it was covered all over with gold . the lad scrubbed and scrubbed , but he could not get the gold off . then he was terribly frightened , he took a rag and wound it about his finger and hoped his master would not notice it .
she put her arm under him and raised him . and he stood up , on my part , i spoke at length to the blind bowler . and gave him many directions ; and he . having received at my hands a purse of gold . for use as i had instructed him .
`` let it be , let it be , '' said the other hags . they put green branches on the fire so that [male] would see the smoke and come to the house . in the morning he came , he brought [male] outside . and after awhile [male] 's senses came back to him . then the giant tied a rope round his arms and drove him before him with a long iron spike that he had for a staff .
then they went up to the castle , and there stood in the hall a dish . and the wrought bride shirt that lay on it seemed as if of gold and silver . the young king went up to it and was going to put it on . but faithful [male] pushed him away , picked it up with his gloved hands . threw it quickly on the fire , and there let it burn .
peter returned at a quicker pace than he had gone thither . the gloom of the pine forest seemed to be intensified , the trees grew in denser clumps . and at last he was so fearful that he broke into a run . and did not regain courage until he heard dogs barking in the distance . and saw , shortly afterwards the smoke from a cottage rising between the trees .
of 1881 , represent a drawinge table , which was the name by which these latest improvements ', were known . the black lines were of stained pear tree , let into the oak . and the acorn shaped member of the leg is an imported dutch design . which became very common about this time , and was applied to the supports of cabinets . sometimes as in the illustration , plainly turned , but frequently carved , another table of this period was the `` folding table , ''
its back and wings were of the colour that we sometimes see reflected in the surface of the ocean or of a lake or river . the wonderful deep blue of a serene sky , its breast was like the shade of the sky on a soft summer day when great white clouds are floating about and a faint haze rests over all the earth . its head was of the same rich , deep tone as the wings and back . and its throat was of that softer blue of the breast . when the bird flew , it seemed as if a line of gold encircled it .
if [female] had been at all unamiable she might have dressed their heads all awry . for such unkindness ; but she returned good for evil , and did it in the best possible style . the sisters were in such spirits they could scarcely eat for two days . all their time was spent before the looking glass , and more than a dozen laces were broken in attempts to tighten their waists into elegant shapes . at length the long wished for evening arrived , and these proud misses stepped into their carriage .
as he said the words , the old man was changed into a black poodle . with a gold chain round his neck . and the scullions brought live coals , which he had to eat till the flames poured out of his mouth . the prince stayed on at the castle for a time . thinking of his mother , and wondering if she were still alive .
he wandered on , his eyes fixed on the sands . so that he did not see the bailiff drive his boat behind a rock . while he changed himself into a heap of wreckage which floated in on the waves . a stumble over a stone recalled [male] to himself . and looking up he beheld the mass of wreckage .
he made war with all his neighbours . and defeated them , the conquered kings were chained up with golden fetters to his chariot when he drove through the streets of his city . these kings had to kneel at his and his courtiers feet when they sat at table . and live on the morsels which they left , at last the prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces . nay , he even wished it to be placed in the churches .
instantly she was changed into the fairy who had appeared to his mother and himself as they had sat at supper the night before . and she smiled graciously at the generous lad , and held out a little wand to him . but with the little wand , and all the instructions that she had given him . he felt that he could face fearlessly any danger that he might be called on to meet . so he rose from the grass and went his way .
having gone into the inn they all three sat down to table , but none of them had any appetite . the fox would also willingly have picked a little , but as his doctor had ordered him a strict diet . he was forced to content himself simply with a [male] dressed with a sweet and [male] sauce . and garnished lightly with fat chickens and early pullets , after the [male] he sent for a made dish of partridges . rabbits , frogs , lizards and other delicacies .
it is a valley between the rocks . which a lady caused to be dammed up a hundred years ago and to be covered with earth and planted with three acacia trees . which now shade the whole island , [male] was quite charmed with this little spot . they must and should go there , yes , it must be charming beyond description to be on the island . but the steamer sailed by , and stopped as it should , at vernex .
[female] and the merchant pleaded one after the other , but when the merchant offered to swear the same oath that he had taken before the cadi . he was stopped by the child , who said that before this was done he must first see the vase of olives . at these words , [male] presented the vase to the [male] . and uncovered it , the [male] took one of the olives . tasted it , and ordered the expert merchants to do the same , they pronounced the olives good .
[female] , my brother [female] ! she cried in [female] , the dwarfs crowded about her . and for fear of seeing them she hid her face in her hands . the dwarfs could not tell her , for the good reason that they did not know . and she wept hot tears and cried aloud for her mother and brother .
if we tried to measure in days and nights as we count them . it would take very many before we had enough to cover the time that [male] remained there . but he was in such a happy state of mind that there seemed to him to be no time at all . this is the way it is with [location] all when we are truly very happy . one day [male] began to grow restless .
in that very moment she fell back upon the bed that stood there . and lay in a deep sleep , and this sleep fell upon the whole castle . the king and queen , who had returned and were in the great hall . fell fast asleep , and with them the whole court , the horses in their stalls . the dogs in the yard , the pigeons on the roof .
it had all occurred so quickly that nobody had noticed the loss of the slipper . not even the princess , whom the king 's cries speedily brought to his side . `` what is the matter , dear father ? '' asked she . but the king could not tell her ; and only managed to gasp out : `` my shoe , my shoe ! '' while the sailors stood round staring .

the simpler forms of the [male] period . and the beautiful furniture of the [male] period . were often painted soft tones of ivory , blue , green . or yellow , and decorated with lovely branches of flowers , birds , and scenery where groups of people by fragonard and other great painters disported with all their eighteenth century charm . these decorations were usually painted on reserves of old ivory with the ground color outside of some soft tone .
nothing now remained to be done but to take [female] to the great wise woman of arifana . and have him disenchanted , the day had arrived for the parents to take [male] with them to arifana . but when they looked for him he could nowhere be found . they searched everywhere—down the well , in the river . in the forest—and made inquiries at all the villages .
and what did he live on ? water cresses , perhaps ; or perhaps water gruel , and water milk . too many land babies do so likewise , but we do not know what one tenth of the water things eat . so we are not answerable for the water babies , then sometimes he came to a deep still reach . and there he saw the water forests , they would have looked to you only little weeds . but [male] , you must remember , was so little that everything looked a hundred times as big to him as it does to you .
all this time , in proportion to the rapidity and urgency of these dreadful sights and sounds . the epilepsy of terror was creeping up to his brain . and with a long and dreadful scream he lost consciousness . when he recovered his senses , he found himself in a small stone chamber . vaulted above , and with a ponderous door , a single point of light in the wall .

they went and presented to it a pipe of peace . filled with sweet scented herbs , and were rejoiced that it took it from them . as they returned to the village , the star . with expanded wings , followed , and hovered over their homes till the dawn of day . again it came to the young man in a dream .
as now none of the flowers seemed to see [female] . she let herself drop heavily out of the drawer down upon the floor . and that gave a great alarum ; all the flowers at once came running up and gathered around her . inquiring if she had hurt herself ; and they were all so exceedingly kind to her . especially those which had lain in her bed , but she had not hurt herself at all .
at these words those mariners , half dead already , recovered , all rushed to the hold and began then to work in it . and they worked from morning till night in the sweat of their brows and with effort . seeking thus to retrieve their past sloth and their blindness , homesickness tortures mainly people who for various reasons are utterly unable to return to their own country . but even those for whom return is merely a question of will power feel its attacks sometimes . the cause may be anything : a sunrise or a sunset which calls to mind a dawn or an evening at home .
just then the bells sounded from below : it was the signal that the time of labour for that day was ended . the hue of [person] still shone on the tops of the trees above . but down in that deep , far extended gulf , it was a perfect twilight . thence , and out of the dark caverns . the workmen swarmed forth , they looked like flies .
the wood elf stopped speaking , for running lightly over the grass . holding each other 's long white veils so as to form a swinging cradle . came a group of nine smooth limbed korrigans , their red gold hair tossing on the wind behind them . in the midst of the hanging cradle lay a tiny baby . with widely opened eyes and a solemn pink face .
this was the reward which the gods gave to courage , when a hero had gloriously lost his life . the valkyries , the nine warrior daughters of [male] . brought his body up to valhalla on their white horses that gallop the clouds . there they lived forever after in happiness , enjoying the things that they had most loved upon earth . every morning they armed themselves and went out to fight with one another in the great courtyard .
however this may have been , it is true the miller had no friends . and equally sure that he cared to have none , for it did not make him a bit unhappy . at last a change came over the miller 's life . he was standing one evening beside the river . watching the moonbeams play upon the water , when something came floating down the stream that attracted his attention .
the three princesses , having drawn up their supply of flour . put it into their storehouse , and went back to their dwelling . their palace was most beautiful , all silver without , and all gold within . all the windows were of crystal ; the chairs and tables were made of diamonds . and the floors of looking glass , the ceilings were like the sky .
far away in the forest , where the warm sun and the fresh air made a sweet resting place . grew a pretty little fir tree , the situation was all that could be desired . and yet the tree was not happy , it wished so much to be like its tall companions . the pines and firs which grew around it . the sun shone , and the soft air fluttered its leaves .
a violet grew among the mosses at the foot of the linden tree where lived the [female] . she was so very tiny and so very modest that few knew there was such a pretty little creature in the world . withal she was so beautiful and so [female] that those who knew the violet loved her very dearly . the south wind came wooing the violet , he danced through the shrubbery and ferns . and lingered on the velvet moss where the little flower grew .
happily [male] was not asked either of these questions , he and [male] ( who , in a tattered cloak and with a pair of brogues on his feet . looked like a highland scarecrow ) were soon perceived by the sentries and conducted to the presence of the commanding officer . evidently a man of rank , in a steel cuirass . crossed by the ribband of the [male] , to whom the others seemed to pay great deference . this proved to be no other than his [male] the duke of montrose .
the lords , in their silks and velvets . opened their eyes wide in astonishment as [female] glided past them with young [female] . the ladies smiled and flouted her , but the [female] paid no heed to their words or looks . [female] was not flattering her as she was used to be flattered . he was telling her of the country in which he dwelt .
i had often implored her to allow me to share the perils to which i knew the queen exposed herself for the [female] of my interests . but my prayers had hitherto been fruitless , pressed to reply to the astounding declaration she had made to me . i , in some confusion , recalled to her that she had often told me that i had no right to dispose of my hand without the commands of my mother . and in her absence , `` that is exactly my opinion , '' she replied . `` i do not wish you to do otherwise ; i am satisfied that you should refer the matter to the queen . ''
presently they heard the frightful scream again , and [person] said . `` we shall get into trouble about that pig . '' oh , never mind , said ib ; we will go home to my father 's house . it is here in the wood , so they went on . but the road led them out of the way .
but , ah , should one tip of his finger touch aught as he passed . it was death , not a fruit on the boughs made him linger . nor the great heaps of gold underneath , but on he fled . holding his breath , until he espied , brightly burning , the mystical lamp in its place ! he plucked the hot wick out , and , turning , with triumph and joy in his face .
the chipmunk laughed and sprang into a hole of a hollow tree near by . but those black stripes on the chipmunk 's back show where the paw of the black bear touched him as he slipped into the tree . ever since this council , and the little chipmunk called so long and loud for `` light and night , '' we have had day and night . flying [male] and lightning bow were two little indian boys .
he was out here a number o ', times . [male] seemed to be his favorite man o business , as you might say , '' `` oh , mrs. carder . tell me all you can about his visits here . the girl 's heart began to beat faster and she drew the clean .
she sang of the [female] who has a boat of her own that is carved out of an opal and steered with a silken sail . of the happy mermen who play upon harps and can charm the great [female] to sleep . of the little children who catch hold of the slippery porpoises and ride laughing upon their backs . of the mermaids who lie in the white foam and hold out their arms to the mariners . and of the sea lions with their curved tusks , and the sea horses with their floating manes .
the girl was fair to see in that her face was smooth and oval , eyes long and dark . mouth small and round , hair of jetty hue . and figure petite and graceful . hanging over a chair by her side was a sealskin sacque . such as is worn by fashionable [location] women , the girl eyed it admiringly and every few moments stroked the soft fur with caressing fingers .
but the men knew nothing of either witchcraft or incantations . so they besought the [male] to help them . at last he agreed , and asked for a thick , strong stick . which he gave into the hands of one of his cheelas . and said : `` go knock each of those donkeys a blow on the head with this . ''
then the dwarf remembered what the fairy told him . that if he attempted to swim the lake , without paying the price . the three cormorants of the western seas would pick the flesh off his bones . he knew not what to do , and was about to turn away , when he heard once more the twang of the golden harp . and the little fairy of the hills stood before him .
so i fetched the water as he asked , and washed and rubbed him . after which he lay down again and slept a little , when he opened his eyes for the second time . he begged me to bring him a melon and some sugar . that he might eat and refresh himself , i soon chose a fine melon out of those which remained . but could find no knife to cut it with , `` look in the cornice over my head , ''
his mother began to cry and wring her hands ; but the cow . surprised at the odd noise in her throat , opened her mouth and let [male] drop out . fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the ground . or he would have been dreadfully hurt , she then put [female] in her bosom and ran home with him . [male] 's father made him a whip of barley straw to drive the cattle with .
the princess had no sooner pronounced these words . but [female] with the tuft appeared to her the finest prince upon earth . the handsomest and most amiable man she ever saw , some affirm that it was not the enchantments of the fairy which worked this change . but that love alone caused the metamorphosis , they say , that the princess . having made due reflection on the perseverance of her lover .
after a few days they went together out of the castle and enchanted wood . both of which immediately vanished , and were nevermore beheld by mortal eyes , the princess was restored to her ancestral kingdom . and after a few years the prince and she became king and queen . and ruled long and happily , now there was a young king of a neighboring country . very handsome , very rich , and wanting nothing but a wife to make him happy .
so when he came to the great stone [male] alighted . and tied his horse to the stile , he then went straight to the tent of the guards . but found no knights there , for they were at the jousting . so he took the sword by the handles . and lightly and fiercely pulled it out of the anvil ; then he mounted his horse and rode his way till he came to his brother sir [male] .
[female] grew more and more discontented every day , but one morning . quite by accident , he hit his elbow against a hidden spring in a certain knot hole of the wall in the dusty laboratory . immediately a secret panel opened , and there behind it was a secret cupboard . in the cupboard was the secretest looking package , wrapped in a velvet cloth . [male] unrolled it eagerly and found a little leather case .
next day sunrise went hunting with evening , whose head was still bound up in a dishcloth . and hurting so sorely that he could hardly see , midnight stayed at home , it was his turn to see to the dinner . sunrise rode out on his cloud white horse , and evening on his dusky brown . midnight stood in the doorway of the hut . watched them disappear among the green trees , and then set about getting the dinner .
and the old man who had spoken of all this shook his head mournfully , and said , forgotten ! ah , yes , everything will be forgotten , and then the conversation turned on other matters . but the youngest child in the room , a boy . with large , earnest eyes , mounted upon a chair behind the window curtains . and looked out into the yard , where the moon was pouring a flood of light on the old gravestone .
nor was this all , other individuals inside the shoe had evidently heard the voice of everychild . and now they began to peep out in the most extraordinary fashion , three pairs of eyes appeared at the broken toe of the shoe . and up the double row of eye holes , all the way up the front of the shoe . startled faces were to be seen , you could see excited eyes with hair hanging down before them . all this proved too much for the little black dog , who had gone forward from [male] 's side to inspect the shoe .
and of an evening , when the field work was done . [female] would lead the herd boys and girls to the tower . and they would sing songs and dance in a ring in the garden with [male] . always lovely , [male] , and joyous , but under the earth [male] once more fell in with the black banewater as it roared and burbled underneath . while he wrestled with it till he forced it deeper and deeper into the earth .
well , he caught up the mirror and hid it in his faded doublet . and took his way to a wood of living green . and when he was alone -- that is , alone with a few flowers and a bird or two . and a million leaves , and the soft singing of a little river hiding its music under many boughs . he took out the mirror from his doublet .
now the prince had formerly been a great hunter , until his passion for the chase was swallowed up by his love for [male] . but the old fancy returned when he saw the white hind . he could not help following her , and sending after her arrows . not a few , from the bow which he always carried , causing her almost to die of fear . although , by the care of the fairy [female] .

the igorot loves all his children , and says , when a boy is born . `` it is good , '' and if a girl is born he says it is equally `` good '' . it is the fact of a child in the family that makes him happy . people in the igorot stage of culture have little occasion to prize one sex over the other . the igorot neither , even in marriage , one is practically as capable as the other at earning a living .

at last , on the other side of that desolate plain . they came to a thick forest , they found a path through the thick undergrowth . and rode along that path together into the very heart of the forest . and there , alone in the heart of the forest , they came to a hut . with a railed yard and a shed full of cattle and sheep .

`` if you desire to do [location] a service , '' said wind rush , `` we shall not say nay . '' at the same time , both he and the others flew up from the hollow . then the fox jumped down in their place , bit at the jar . and pulled at the lock -- but he could not open it either .
then anon they delivered sir [male] under this promise . that he should bear the dead lady to the court . the severed head hanging about his neck , right so he rode forth unto camelot . and [male] made him tell of his adventure . and how he slew the lady , and how he would give no [male] unto the knight .
pawnees dance the bison dance in war habit and with bison skins and horns over their heads . the creeks dance similarly , uttering sounds in imitation of the bison . their bodies bent almost double and two staffs being held to represent the animal 's forelegs . the initiation day has at its root the idea of transforming the man into a member of the kin by giving him a share of the nature of the animal . dances may give magical power over the animal to be chased .
he did hear the car door slam . when mr. [male] got out , `` what 's the matter ? '' mr. [male] did not know anything about trolls . but he knew about children , and what he saw was a very dirty little child sitting by the side of the road , crying . mr. [male] taught third grade and would have been at school .
that blast pierced right into the heart of [male] . and straightway he turned his army towards the pass of roncesvalles that he might succour [male] . whom he so greatly loved , yet then it was too late , [male] was nearly dead . [male] knew himself to be dying , [male] , [male] 's faithful warhorse . was enduring agonies from wounds of the paynim arrows .
it all went well long as the money lasted , when that was gone , once more the father planned to take them to the forest . and leave them as before , [male] , who heard again the plotting . crept from his trundle bed , but in the place of pebbles in his pockets put only crumbs of bread . again they went , through [male] and through thicket . into the darksome wood ; again he dropped his clues along the pathway behind him when he could .
then [male] kissed his boy , and wept over him . and they went down to the ship ; and [male] came down with them . weeping , and kissed them one by one , and blest them , and promised to them great renown . and the heroes wept when they left him . till their great hearts could weep no more ; for he was kind and just and pious .
truly the forest dwellers did not lack amusement , each full moon they danced in the royal circle of the queen . there were also the feast of nuts , the jubilee of autumn tintings . the solemn ceremony of leaf shedding and the revelry of budding day . but these periods of enjoyment were far apart , and left many weary hours between . while this mood lay heavy upon pretty [male] it chanced that the great ak visited the forest of burzee and allowed the wood nymphs as was their wont .
`` 'if i were only small enough to dance with them , '' said i . listening so intently that i felt myself contracting into the compass of their song . and the wand diminishing in my hand . till there we were , myself and the loveliest little fairy queen dancing together through the mazes of the tiny troop . bewildered by the [female] of the faces that passed [location] like dreams of beauty .
the body of [female] arose if this terrible stranger returns tomorrow he will slay america all , they whispered , as they looked pityingly at [male] . who was trying in vain to show no signs of apprehension . when the next evening came , and men sat in the red branch house . talking little and waiting for what would happen , in came [male] , the stranger .
once more he beheld the river which , sparkling and bright , wound through the green plain like a silver snake . smaller hills covered with forests fell away on all sides and the tops of the trees caught the [male] of the sinking sun . over the snow fields of the further mountain ranges , a rosy shimmer spread that made him think of the peach blossoms at home . a purple mist obscured the rocky peaks behind him and there . far away to the south , was a tiny speck of blue .
cried the young ladies , and they quickly put out the fire . now the tree did not even dare tremble , what a state he was in ! he was so uneasy lest he should lose something of his [male] . that he was quite bewildered amidst the glare and brightness . when suddenly both folding doors opened and a troop of children rushed in as if they would upset the tree .
little [male] was quite satisfied , for his explorations kept him busy . every evening , he told his godmother all the things he had found under the cupboard and [organization] and around the hearth . and she was surprised to learn how her room appeared when looked at from the floor . then she told him more stories and became as interested herself in the fairy tales as when she first heard them as a child . often they sat thus together even into the night , little [female] could not hear enough of the sweet princesses taken away by the wizards into deep caverns .
the old cook , who knew that the child had the power of wishing . came by and stole it ; he also killed a chicken . and dropped some of its blood on the queen 's garments . then he took the child away to a secret place . where he placed it out to be nursed , then he ran back to the king .
all this doing sir [male] saw , and then he came into the field with sir lavaine . as if it had been thunder , he encountered with sir [male] . and by force smote him and his horse to the earth . and then one knight after another all with one spear , and sir lavaine encountered with sir palamides . and either met other so hard and so fiercely that both their horses fell to the earth .
the keeper of an augsburg bath house , who had burned herself with boiling water . occupied the next bed , she was recovering , and was a talkative woman . whose intrusive loquacity at first annoyed [female] , nay , when she could not silence it . caused her pain , but her conversation soon revealed that she knew every stick and stone in her native city . [female] availed herself of this , and did not need to ask many questions to learn everything that she desired to know about the little beggar landed elf .
forsaken by all , lay the old bachelor , unable to help himself , he could scarcely reach the water jug that he had placed by his bedside . and the last drop it contained had been consumed , it was not fever . nor sickness , but old age that had struck him down . up yonder , where his couch was placed , he was overshadowed as it were by continual night . a little spider , which , however , he could not see , busily and [organization] its web around him .
the culvert was not much of a bridge , it was just a big . old concrete pipe that went under the road for rain water to go through . he wished that it was a bridge . any kind of bridge at all , even a wooden bridge . but a real bridge that he could hide under and come rushing out to scare people .
these events made a profound impression upon the mind of [female] . and all the more so when notice came from the king that he should pay him a visit in the following week . the lord chief justice was a wily and astute man . although his life had not been reputable , the peccadilloes of great lawyers in that country were so usual as to be regarded by the public with a lenient eye . and , late in life , his appearance had become so eminently respectable , that a stranger would certainly have taken him for a dean rather than for a judge .
several centuries have passed since the time of the ancestor to whom we owe the wonderful history of the elixir as written in this book . and preserved from generation to generation in our family . many ueberhells have closed their eyes forever , since then , and even the graves of dr. [male] and his beautiful wife [male] have disappeared . owing to the removal of the burying ground , on the other hand the portrait in red crayon of [male] and the little [male] is still carefully preserved as a most precious heirloom . and was the picture that inspired my sainted father with the desire to become an artist .
the people could hardly believe their eyes , and looked at each other as if they felt that they must all be in a dream . or suffering from some optical delusion , and that it could not be a reality which was passing before them . but [female] took it all quite as a matter of course . she ordered [female] , in haughty tones . to kneel on all fours , and as soon as he had done so , she sat down upon him with the greatest calmness .
i have also entered a railway carriage with my cage of rats when there were passengers in . one or two of whom would generally object to live rats being in the same compartment . and on enquiring of the railway officials . i have found that any one travelling with live rats is expected to put them in the guard 's van . further , rat catching is a business in which one is not called upon to allow credit .
[female] , profiting by her mother 's instructions . said that she was the most unhappy person in the world to have such a wicked and cruel stepmother . and that she would have to suffer until her stepsister was married , the prince assured her that he would marry her if she would have him . and that he would give her his heart and his crown . and he removed a ring from his finger and put it on the finger of [male] .
they did so with many murmurs of surprise and admiration . and for once , perhaps , it may be of interest to know of what the dinner consisted . at one end was a roast capon . cooked to [person] , at the other a [person] , of so delicate a colour and flavour that it must surely have belonged to a fairy pig ! then there were potatoes , so white and floury that i feel convinced they must have been whisked over from [person] .
next morning when the mist had cleared away , and the sun was shining . a little ship set sail for foreign countries . and [male] begged the captain to take him in it that he might seek [male] still farther . they sailed and sailed , till at last they came to the country for which they were bound . but they found the whole land in confusion .
the next night [female] started again to the castle in her dress of tow . and at the gate she grasped the second bead in her fingers . repeating the charm , this time the pale yellow of the daffodils seemed to have woven itself into a cloth of gold for her adorning . it was like a shimmer of moon beams . and her hair held the diamond flashings of a hundred tiny stars .
they had so much to do before they were ready that when they reached the huge green hill the sun was going down and what do you think they heard ? but they did not know that the picnic was shouting and screaming for joy . so they ran and ran and ran -- and stumbled and scrambled and hurried and scurried and flurried faster and faster till they had scrambled up the huge green hill to where the lion 's cave was and then they gathered behind a big clump of bushes and the fathers began to cock their guns and the mothers to sharpen their scissors and hat pins . but the mother with the pepper pot had nothing to sharpen . so she peeped from behind the bushes , and suddenly she cried out , oh , oh , oh , oh , look , look !
after five or six years sir we 's money came to an end . so his son took the straw hat to yangdschou and there asked for old [male] . the latter just happened to be standing in his drug shop , mixing herbs , when the son explained his errand he said . `` the money is ready , but is your hat genuine ? '' and he took the hat and examined it .
never before had so grand a wedding been seen , and there was so much food and wine that even the glutton and the thirsty comrade had enough to eat and drink . there was once upon a time a man and his wife . and they had no children , which was a great grief to them . one winter 's day , when the sun was shining brightly . the couple were standing outside their cottage , and the woman was looking at all the little icicles which hung from the roof .
when [female] aniello , who had travelled about in the world and eaten bread from more than one oven . heard this gibberish he turned on his heel and scampered off . and , running home , he twisted the cock 's neck . and opening its head found the stone , which he had instantly set in a brass ring . then , to make a trial of its virtue , he said .
bizarre turned his head and saw a child that answered in every respect to the countess 's description . with a high , round forehead , black , wild looking eyes , rough hair turned back in the chinese fashion . dull , brown skin , great white teeth . red hands , and long arms , she was anything but a beauty . but the chrysalis gives birth to the butterfly .
so i never said anything more to her , save about plates and fritters and such things , i understood . it would indeed be a great , lonely , terrifying world if these little friendly folk did not live in cellars . walls , attics , stair closets and the like . of course they were friendly , why should they be otherwise ? we looked up , the dimness of the ceiling was miles deep .
[male] eldest son , [male] , always seemed most favoured by the fairy in the pretty things she sent ashore . and certainly he was a very nice boy , and a very good one on the whole . cheerful and honest as the daylight , and very intelligent ; but i can not tell you . dear readers , that he had no faults . for that was not at all likely , and you would not believe it if i said so .
thor looked out on the two great rolling rivers of cloud . it was a bad way for one to go , cold and suffocating . yet if he went that way he could keep on his shoulder the hammer which he would not leave in another 's charge . he stept out into the cloud river that flowed by the rainbow bridge . and with his hammer upon his shoulder he went struggling on to the other river .
aladdin laughed in spite of his disturbed frame of mind at the major 's suspicions . it was such an absurd idea that he could be at the head of a badger gang . and yet , after all , he could not deny a certain sort of reasonableness in the notion from major bondifeller 's point of view . again taking the lamp casually in his hand , more as an outlet for his embarrassment than for any other reason . he gave it a second rub and started to answer the major 's question .
come , palmer , said horn , lend me your cloak and scrip . i must see this strange bridal , and it may be i shall make some there repent of the wrong they have done to a [male] . i will essay to enter , the change was soon made , and horn darkened his face and hands as if bronzed with eastern suns . bowed his back , and gave his voice an old man 's feebleness . so that no man would have known him ; which done , he made his way to king [male] 's new castle .
said little [female] , and how she ever could have spoken in poetry is more than i can tell . but perhaps the fairy maple sugar candy . which she had eaten on her way to town . had lent magic to her tongue , then the little old woman made a curtsy . and [female] continued on her way .
away went flying soot at full speed until he came to the seven hills of ash . there in a great hollow between them crouched the giant of the wide grey plain . he was grumbling and grumbling to himself , for no one had invited him to join them in any evil magic for a long while . so he was having a terribly stupid time of it . and wished with all his heart that something would happen that would give him a chance to show his power .
the thursday following , fresh grief , fresh [male] . however , [male] said as he had vanquished the first [male] . he reckoned he could conquer the second , but this time also he took refuge among the branches of a tree . saying : `` why two victims ? one is surely sufficient , '' [male] again obtained the cook 's permission to go out . he said to play with some children on the sea shore .
and when the dove had done its song , it came flying and perched upon her shoulder . and so went home with her , there was once a king 's daughter who was the most beautiful thing in the world . and as her hair was fair and reached to her feet she was called the princess [female] . a handsome young king in the neighbourhood , although he had never seen this princess . fell so deeply in love with her from what he had heard .
she took up three locks of her hair and spread them out one night and straight four nights discovered at once unto my sight . then did she turn her visage up to the moon of the sky and showed me two moons at one season . both burning clear and bright , she hath two wrists , which , were they not by bracelets held . i trow , would flow out of their sleeves as brooks of liquid silver flow . her slender waist a pair of buttocks overlies .
professor [female] , of [organization] . listing the causes of retardation , puts at the foot of his list bad inheritance . unredeemable defects , physical and mental , and at the very top , ignorance and indifference on the part of parents . most investigators would evaluate these contrasting causes in precisely the same way . the inference , needless to say , is that we need never hope to bring about an appreciable diminution in the number of retarded children until parents are more fully enlightened as to their duties and responsibilities .
the miller was sifting meal in the trough . but he straightened himself up when he saw the little cake . but the little bannock had no wish to be eaten up by the miller , so it turned and ran out of the mill . and the miller was so busy that he did not trouble himself to run after it . after this it ran on , and on , and on , till it came to the smithy .
he knew not the names of these birds . nor where they had flown , but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world . he was not envious of these beautiful creatures , but wished to be as lovely as they . poor ugly creature , how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement . the winter grew colder and colder .
he made himself a bed of grass and leaves . lit a fire of dry branches , and slept soundly till the next morning . then he got up and walked towards a beautiful white palace which he saw gleaming in the distance . in about an hour he reached the building . and opening the door he walked in , after wandering through many marble halls .
from the side streets sounded the merry notes of fiddles and wind instruments , up ! to the dance , to the dance , to jollity and pleasure ! that was their invitation , such music it was . that horses , carriages , trees , and houses would have danced . if they had known how , the charm of intoxicating delight filled the bosom of the dryad .
now the [female] wanted very much to cross over to inaba , day after day he would go out and sit on the shore and look longingly over the water in the direction of inaba . and day after day he hoped to find some way of getting across . one day as usual , the [male] was standing on the beach . looking towards the mainland across the water , when he saw a great crocodile swimming near the island . the crocodile , who had come out all by itself that day to enjoy the bright [male] .
the next day the little chickens were all hatched and doing well , the hen had led them to the courtyard . and , scratching the soil and clucking , she dug up small seeds which the little ones came and took from their mother 's beak . at the slightest approach of danger , the hen called the brood . and all ran to snuggle under her outspread wings , the boldest soon put their heads out . their pretty little yellow heads framed in their mother 's black feathers .
when [male] awoke in the morning . he told his wife the wonderful news of what had happened to him during the night . and began to make preparations for his son to start for the capital without delay . in order to secure the honours promised by the emperor . his wife , however , was by no means reconciled to the idea of parting with her son .
the old tailor could scarcely believe him , but he did as he was told . then the youth spread a cloth on the floor and brought in the ass . telling his brother to speak to it , the miller called out , `` bricklebit ! '' and immediately the gold pieces began dropping out on to the floor in showers . till they all had as much as they could carry , then the table was brought in and the carpenter said .
she makes an effort , and rouses herself . what has become of the coach , the castle , the servants ? nothing but the strange forest remains the same , she is jolting along on a rude hurdle . seated on rushes , and a tall , big boned man , in rags . sits in front , kicking with his heel the ill favoured beast that pulls them along .
then the rich prince , that he might show favour to the envoys . bade bring thither of his own bounty gold upon broad shields . he had plenty thereof , his friends also gave them rich gifts . [male] and [male] , [male] and [male] . let it be seen that they could give freely , they offered such costly things to the envoys that these durst not take them .
not knowing if it was proper to receive him or not , the slaves returned to their [female] and told her all they had seen . but not before she had caught sight of the merchant from the roof of her palace . luckily her gaoler was away , always trying to catch the stud of mares . so for the moment she was free and alone , they were just about to land . when the mother of the genius stood before them .
the younger was the image of her dead father . she was sweet and kind hearted , besides being very beautiful , while her mother loved the elder daughter to distraction . she hated the younger , the poor child had to eat in the kitchen . and work day and night . and twice every day she had to walk several miles to a distant fountain to fetch home a large pitcher of water .
then all the fishes went in a procession before them to the interior of the palace . she was more beautiful than anything on earth . and her robes of pink and green changed colour like the surface of the sea at sunset in some sheltered cove . there were threads of pure gold in her long hair . and , as she smiled , her teeth looked like little white pearls .
once upon a time , two little fairies went out into the world . to seek their fortune , [male] was as gay and gallant a little elf as ever spread a wing . his purple mantle , and doublet of green , were embroidered with the brightest threads . and the plume in his cap came always from the wing of the gayest butterfly . such was [male] ; but far different was his little friend , [female] . kind .
[female] now saw clearly how in a moment of weakness he had made a great and fatal mistake by joining with the jacobites . but his sense of honour was such that in spite of all colonel [male] could say . he would not go back on his word , his own hastiness . the clever wiles of [male] mac ivor . [male] 's beauty , and most of all the rascality of [male] had indeed brought his neck .
in ancient times a door in a rock near this lake was found open upon a certain day every year . i think it was may day , those who had the curiosity and resolution to enter were conducted by a secret passage . which terminated in a small island in the centre of the lake . here the visitors were surprised with the prospect of a most enchanting garden stored with the choicest fruits and flowers . and inhabited by the tylwyth teg , or fair family .
as he rode through the land , he saw how it seemed that a dire pestilence had swept over it . for where he had seen the golden corn waving in miles of smiling fields . he saw it now blackened along the ground . the trees were stripped of their leaves and fruit . the cattle lay dead in the meads , and the fish rotted in the streams .
although she was half stifled from her confinement in the chest . the princess speedily revived , and , when she was able to sit up , the prince began to question her as to who she was and how she came to be shut up in the chest and set afloat upon the water . and she , blushing and [female] to find herself in the presence of so many strangers . told him that she was the princess of rahmatabad . and that she had been put into the chest by her own father .
he usually refreshed himself with two or three drams of this kind before beating the inmates of his house . his three little children , cowering in a corner , eyed him from under a table . as [male] did the ogre in the nursery tale . his wife , [female] , standing behind a chair . which she was ready to snatch up to meet the blow of the cudgel .
but he could see nothing , except the trees and the flowers . and so he left the forest and stood in the desolate plain . in the distance he saw a very high hill and as he approached nearer he noticed on the summit a tall tree . without branches or leaves , with great difficulty he climbed the hill . it was quite smooth , bare of vegetation and without rocks .
thus said the famous italian scientist , [female] , a good many years ago . the facts of more recent research into the psychology and psychopathology of childhood . as reviewed in the preceding chapters , vindicate professor [male] 's statement to an extent and in ways undreamed of by him . nor is it only the emotionally disturbing things seen , heard , or experienced by children that may have a decisively adverse influence on their development . harm may similarly and equally be done by the books and stories they read .
the inhabitants are not of the form that you see me under . they are little winged men , very pretty , very gallant , very amorous , and so volatile that they hardly love the same thing for even one day . whilst the golden age reigned on the earth , [male] , who at that time flattered himself that the hearts of all mankind would be ever fond and faithful . feared that by the facility with which we flew about the world . we might teach mortals the agreeable art of changing in love .
two years passed , during which i completely lost sight of [male] . i learned that he had been dismissed from the service of the immigration company . that he played second violin for a few months at one of the lowest city theatres . and finally made a bold stroke for fame by obtaining the democratic nomination for county clerk . i was faithless enough , however , to call attention to the fact that he had never been naturalized .
he said he was sorry he could not think of any way of preventing the evil she expected . but that he would leave his ox to stay all night with her . as it might be a sort of company for her in her loneliness . she led the ox into her cabin . tied it to the head of her bedstead .
then she went to her room and prepared for her journey . she combed her [female] hair . tied it in a knot on the top of her head . and fastened it with a golden pin , then she put on a short garment embroidered with purple . and shoes woven of dark silk , in her breast she hid a dagger with dragon lines graved on it .
and when the bird came to dish up the dinner , there was no cook to be seen . and he turned over the heap of wood . and looked and looked , but the cook never appeared again , by accident the wood caught fire . and the bird hastened to fetch water to put it out . but he let fall the bucket in the well .
the prince and the vizier 's son most gladly accepted the invitation . and received a right noble welcome from the king , the marriage soon took place . and then after a few weeks the king gave them presents of horses and elephants . and jewels and rich cloths , and bade them start for their own land . for he was sure that the king would now receive them .
but [female] had set his heart on climbing . and he told his mother not to be afraid , he would soon see what it all meant . so up he climbed , he climbed for hours . he went higher and higher , and at last , quite tired out , he reached the top . or then he looked about him , it was all new .
so as they could not cross the river by themselves . a goose and gander carried them across on their backs . as they went on the merchant 's son asked the girl how far she would like to go . a six days journey or a six months ', journey . he told her that in the six months journey they would only have fruits and roots and such like to eat and water to drink .
the following is a striking instance of the ambiguity of oracular predictions .

when [female] heard what had taken place , he ordered that the peasant 's crust should be restored . so the demon who had stolen it `` turned himself into a good youth , '' and became the peasant 's hireling , when a drought was impending . he scattered the peasant 's seed corn over a swamp . when a wet season was at hand .
on this , miss crocodile began to wag her tail very gently , and mr. [male] ran off . roaring with laughter , and saying , `` oho , oho , so dead folks always wag their tails ! '' one moonlight night a miserable , half starved [male] . skulking through the village , found a worn-out pair of shoes in the gutter . they were too tough for him to eat , so , determined to make some use of them .
when the people found that they could get things to eat right out of the ground . from the seed they had planted , their children were wild with joy . no people ever loved babies more than these cymry folk and it was they who invented the cradle . this saved the hard-working mothers many a burden , for each woman had . besides rearing the children , to work for and wait on her husband .
`` now you are beautiful indeed , '' said the woman , and , fancying she heard footsteps . she rushed away as quickly as she could , not long after , the seven dwarfs came home . and they were terribly frightened to see dear little [female] lying on the ground without motion . as if she were dead , they lifted her up . and saw in a moment that her stays had been laced too tight quickly they cut the stay lace in two .
`` come in , '' said the king , as [male] knocked at the door . [male] opened it , and the old king . in a dressing gown and embroidered slippers , came towards him . he had the crown on his head . carried his sceptre in one hand , and the orb in the other .

[male] was declared the victor , and the master was obliged to acknowledge that the boy had made both the lock and the knife . the king in his indignation would have had the master put to death if the boy had not begged for [male] on the culprit .

now the fame of these wonders was noised abroad , and the people flocked in great numbers to see the three marvels . and the [male] who had won them ; and among the sightseers came the king 's son . who would not go till everything was shown him , and till he had heard how it had all happened . and the prince admired the strangeness and beauty of the treasures in the palace . but more than all he admired the beauty and courage of the [male] who had brought them there .

as he stood there hungry and drowsy , and looked around in all directions , his glance fell upon a pair of squirrels . who played upon the wooded point , directly opposite the rock island . he wondered if the squirrels still had any of their winter supplies left . and asked the white [male] to take him over to the point . that he might beg them for a couple of hazelnuts .
`` you shall have both , '' declared the emperor , and ordered a [female] to fetch them .

she attended to the cattle , and took particular charge of keeping the calves from the cows at night . she followed the house , and was alive not many years ago . a portion of milk was poured out for her every evening on a stone called clach na [female] . and once this was neglected by a new tenant , the calves were found next morning with the cows . her face was described by those who professed to have seen her , as being like a grey stone overgrown with lichens .
but my poor father and mother used to shake their heads at me when they saw this . and say , ah , naughty girl , to take the little birds out of their nests . that stealing will bring you no good , all my family were very fond of music . you know that [male] sings very nicely and plays upon the guitar . and my son in law plays on the pianoforte and the fiddle ( we have got two fiddles in our house now ) .
ah , that means me , if i had only known it then ! and just now i was wondering if he really loved me , and perhaps felt almost in my secret heart to grieve a bit . to [male] at him , i fear i spoke as he little dreamed then the `` dear one '' would ever do , what shall i do ? i remember him now , in all his young loveliness . in all the excitability of a first love , and my heart kindles too warmly to write what i wished .
`` you nasty brute , '' said the cowboy . coming down to him from the tree , 't is little i care for you ', . and then they went at each other , so great was the noise between them that there was nothing in the world but what was looking on and listening to the combat . `` i have you at last ; you are done for now !

the mechanic builds the house , but the architect creates it . the artisan makes the tools , but the artist uses them . the observer sees and records the fact . but the scientist discovers the law ; the man of affairs manages the practical concerns of the world from day to day . but the poet makes it spiritual , significant , interesting , worth living in .
wondering what it was the bells rang for . he said to his servant -- but where is the company ? and scarcely had he spoken when the hall they were in opened out to a great extent . and a canopy set with diamonds and precious stones was drawn over it . at the same moment he saw an immense throng of nicely dressed little men and women pouring in through several open doors .
there was , at the time when the story of the antiquary and his doings draws to a close . a daily expectation of a french invasion , beacons had been prepared on every hill and headland . and men were set to watch , one of these beacons had been intrusted to old [male] the hairdresser . and one night he saw , directly in the line of the hill to the south which he was to watch . a flame start suddenly up , it was undoubtedly the token agreed upon to warn the country of the landing of the french .

very soon they arrived at the bridal hall . on the right stood all the little lady mice , whispering and giggling as if they were making game of each other . to the left were the gentlemen mice . stroking their [person] with their forepaws , and in the center of the hall could be seen the bridal pair . standing side by side in a hollow cheese rind and kissing each other while all eyes were upon them .
this he did and they tied the flower and the hair up carefully and set off to the home . where [female] 's first wife was awaiting them . she told her parents that [male] had come back with one of his sisters . and that she now wished to go back with them on a visit to their home . her parents assented and the three of them set out and one evening reached the outskirts of the village in which [male] had been born .
and in her love she did not scold him . for she loved him and scolded not , she longed for no revenge . for she loved him ... then she saw . she saw , squatting in the sand , a terribly great beast like a lion , immovable . the beast was as great as a castle , high as a tower .
the fairy threw off her dazzling attire . bent back the boughs , and in another moment was hidden among them . a clap of thunder , loud and awful , resounded through the [male] air . all around him fell into ruin , the lovely fairy . the beautiful garden , sunk deeper and deeper .
with a wild exclamation the distracted woman ran on towards the hill alone . clapping her hands , and crying aloud the name of her lost child . scared and horrified , [female] , not daring to follow , gazed after her , and burst into tears . and the other children raised high their lamentations in shrill rivalry . twilight was deepening , it was long past the time when they were usually barred securely within their habitation .
he could also shoot a blunt arrow through the thickest ox hide from a cross bow . he could change weapons from one hand to the other during a fencing match . or fence with either hand , or throw two spears at the same time . or catch a spear in motion , he could run so fast that no horse could overtake him . and play the rough games with bat and ball .
then the kitchen boy ran and told the king . and he came with his sword and brandished it three times over the duck . and at the third time his wife stood before him living . and hearty , and sound , as she had been before , the king was greatly rejoiced . but he hid the queen in a chamber until the sunday came when the child was to be baptized .
so very tenderly he took up the child , and wrapped the cloak around it to shield it from the harsh cold . and made his way down the hill to the village . his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of heart . and when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her . she put her arms round his neck and kissed him .
the king had just awakened from his midday sleep . for it was summer , and everyone rose early and rested from twelve to three . as they do in hot countries , he had dressed himself in cool white clothes . and was passing through the hall on his way to the council chamber . when a number of young nobles suddenly appeared before him .
so it was , or at least in some such way , and to the accompaniment of the wildest ravings about some [female] or other heard all too distinctly over the garden wall . ( `` overdressed snobbs take my rare old english adjective [female] .., ! '' ) -- that they carried the sea lady up through the house and laid her down upon the couch in mrs. [female] 's room . and just as miss [female] was suggesting that the very best thing they could do would be to send for a doctor . the sea lady with a beautiful naturalness sighed and came to .
when [male] heard this he was astonished and defiant . then , seeing that he was alone and without prospect of succour . he grew downcast and was in great fear for his life . but remembering the safeguards under which he had been placed , he enumerated these to the assembly . and called on the high king to grant him the protections that were his due .
he immediately assembled all the old and wise beads of the nation to come and be witnesses to the exploits which it was reported that the young man could perform . the sixth giant , although neither very old nor very wise , thrust himself in among the relations of the old chief . when they were all assembled and seated in a circle , the old chief took his pipe and filled it . and passed it to the indians around , to see if anything would happen when they smoked . they passed it on until it came to the dog .
they went out every day upon parties of pleasure . balls , plays , concerts , etc . and laughed at their youngest sister , because she spent the greatest part of her time in reading good books . as it was known that they were to have great fortunes . several eminent merchants made their addresses to them .
presently a procession of all kinds of fishes came in . all richly attired in flowing robes of various colours , each one advanced with slow and stately pace . some bearing beautiful flowers , others great mother of pearl dishes laden with all the delicacies that go to make a feast . others bore trays of [male] . red and white , with fragrant wines and rare fruits such as only grow at the bottom of the sea .
when he got there , he sat down on a tuft of grass near the cave . and considered what he should do next , the first thing was , of course . to bring the dragon out , and the next to make him breathe water instead of fire . `` i have it , '' cried [male] at last . and he nodded his head so many times that the white crane expected to see it fall off .
in the morning the princess showed [female] over the palace . and pointed out all the wonders it contained , the whole place was fashioned out of pink and white [female] . beautifully carved and inlaid everywhere with priceless pearls , but , wonderful as was the palace itself . the wide gardens that encircled it appealed to [female] even more . these gardens were designed so as to represent the four seasons , turning to the east .
the other agreed , and went without suspicion , but when they got out , the murderers sprang upon him . bound him , and prepared to hang him on a tree . while they were about it , they heard in the distance the clatter of hoofs and the sound of singing . which frightened them so much that they stuck their prisoner into a sack . head foremost , slung it up on a branch .
as for the old gray man he was never seen again , and as the golden goose had disappeared also . perhaps he flew away on it , there was once a girl who was so idle and lazy that she would do nothing but sit in the [female] all day . she would not bake , she would not brew , she would not spin . she would not sew , one morning her mother lost [female] with her entirely . and gave her a good beating , the girl cried out until she could be heard even into the street .
when he awoke he was astonished to see there a fair bed in which lay a dead gentlewoman . as he looked he saw in her right hand sir [male] 's letter . which told who she was and what she had achieved , there sir [female] spent some days . not knowing what to do , one night as he was sitting on the shore . he heard a horseman coming that way and waited to see what would happen .
the mother of the sun received her . and was amazed to see a creature of another race in those regions . and full of compassion when she heard what had befallen her . then , when she had promised to ask her son about the damsel 's husband . she hid her in the cellar .
nothing amused our ancestors more than these blind encounters . even kings took part at these burlesque representations . at mid lent annually they attended with their court at the quinze vingts . in [location] , in order to see blindfold persons . armed from head to foot , fighting with a lance or stick .
the great festival in honour of [female] . called the vestalia , was celebrated on the 9th of june , [female] was the daughter of [female] and [female] . she represented that portion of [female] which we call the earth 's crust . and which produces all vegetation , as goddess of agriculture . field fruits , plenty , and productiveness .
the magician never doubted but this was the lamp he wanted , there could be no other such in this palace . where every utensil was gold or silver , he snatched it eagerly out of the slave 's hand . and thrusting it as far as he could into his breast . offered him his basket , and bade him choose which he liked best . the slave picked out one and carried it to the princess .
but to [female] , who knew no fear , fear came at last . she was returning one evening from the shadowy hills . untired by the chase that had lasted for many an hour , when , face to face . she met with one whom hitherto she had only seen from afar . of him the other nymphs spoke often , who was so great as pan ? -- pan .
lita and his bride lived happily together and were soon deeply in love with each other . and after a time he told her about his father 's blindness and how he wished to try to cure it with one of her flowers . she readily agreed to help him ; so the next day she went to her father and said that she wished to pay a short visit to her husband 's home . the rakhas consented and she and [female] took their leave . she told [male] that when the rakhas offered him a farewell gift .
handle them as little as possible , always catch as many rats as you can in your buildings in january and february . as they begin to breed in march , and every bitch rat means . on the average , eight more , also get as much ferreting done as possible before breeding time . for a young rat can get into the ends of the joisting under a floor . where a ferret can not get near it , and the consequence is that a ferret is unable to cope with its task .
on my twelfth birthday it chanced that i was in my father 's shop , alone . my mother had gone into the back room , and my father was absent . for the day , at the residence of a distant client . i had been trying all that morning to find some occupation to amuse me . but without success ; i had finally given myself up to a restless and discontented idleness .
in its flash the air hung still . bewitched with snow flakes , thunder and wind made such a clamour between them that nod could scarcely hear himself think . but the travellers sat mute and [male] . and moved never a finger , such storms [male] like wild birds through these mountains of arakkaboa . and , like birds , are as quickly flown away , for in a little while all was peace again and silence .
after many had met their death thus , there came a young man , beautiful to behold . and as clever as he was beautiful , who had a great desire to attempt the enterprise . first he went to a herdsman , and begged him to hide him in a sheepskin . which had a golden fleece , and in this disguise to take him to the king . the shepherd let himself be persuaded so to do , took a skin having a golden fleece .
she with the hanging lip moistened the thread . and the woman with the broad [female] pressed and twisted it . they worked so fast that the thread flowed on like a swift stream . before the next evening they had finished the whole roomful of flax . the next day the girl was taken into the second room .
in an instant the heavens seemed to darken round him and he was surrounded by fire . fire to right of him . fire to left of him , fire to front of him . fire to rear of him ; nothing but fire whichever way he looked . for the dragon 's seven heads were vomiting flame .
acorn before oak i knew , an egg before a hen . but i never heard of an eggshell brew a dinner for harvest men . so she went back into the house , seized the children and threw them into the [female] . and the goblins in their blue trousers came and saved their dwarfs and the mother had her own children back and so the great strife ended . long ago a poor widow woman lived down near the iron forge .
beautiful and fascinating arabesques were carved and painted on the walls and pilasters . the chief pieces of furniture were magnificently carved chests and coffers which were also sometimes gilded and painted . oblong tables with elaborately carved supports at each end . usually with a connecting shelf on which were smaller carved supports , the chairs were high backed with much carving and gilding . and there were others of simpler form with leather or tapestry or damask seats and backs .
so it was until within fifty yards from the finish . when a totally unexpected incident suddenly changed the aspect of affairs . out from the second rank darted a pig of a sandy colour . and with a squeal hardly to be expected from an animal which had gone nearly half a mile at best pace . shot forward from the others and rapidly gained upon the leading pig , the shouts from the crowd now rent the skies .
he and the shepherdess had been placed close together , side by side . and , being so placed , they became engaged to each other , for they were very well suited . being both made of the same sort of [location] , and being equally fragile , close to them stood another figure . three times as large as they were , and also made of [location] . he was an old chinaman , who could nod his head .
one evening the sun was just setting in wintry [female] when a flock of beautiful large birds appeared out of the bushes . the duckling had never seen anything so beautiful , they were dazzlingly white with long waving necks . they were swans ; and , uttering a peculiar cry . they spread out their magnificent broad wings , and flew away from the cold regions to warmer lands and open seas . they mounted so high , so very high , and the ugly little duckling became strangely uneasy .
the ten gentlemen , perceiving that i was positive in my resolution . took a sheep and killed it , and , after they had taken off the skin . presented me with the knife , telling me it would be useful to me on a certain occasion . which they should tell me of presently , we must sew you into this skin . said they , and then leave you ; upon which a fowl of monstrous size .
the resolution he afterwards had taken to leave every thing to find her out . and never to return home till he had regained her out of the hands of the perfidious wretch . and by what good fortune , at last , after a long and fatiguing journey . he had the satisfaction to find her in the palace of the sultan of cashmeer . he then desired the princess to inform him of all that happened to her .
the husband did not think much of the matter ; but still he thanked [male] grau for her trouble . then he went home and ate his dinner . laid down and pretended to fall asleep at once , thereupon his wife went to his shaving kit . took out his razor , went softly up to him and took hold of his chin with her hand . `` do you want to murder me ? '' he cried .
`` the dear papa , '' cried [female] , and sure enough , the proud form of [female] was before them . one moment and the happy wife was folded to the warm , true heart of her returned husband . and [male] clung to his arm . weeping for joy , once more light and happiness dawned upon the buenna vineyard . with the return of the loved husband and father .
then as he beat her with the stick he cried . `` this is it , wife , this is it . '' in this way he quieted his wife . and she never asked him again what he had been laughing at . there once lived an emperor whose name was trojan , this emperor had goat 's ears .
the paucity of the pure mental life of the igorot is nowhere more clearly shown than in the scarcity of folk tales . i group here seven tales which are quite commonly known among the people of [person] . the second , third , fourth , and fifth are frequently related by the parents to their children . and i heard all of them the first time from boys about a dozen years old . i believe these tales are nearly all the pure fiction the igorot has created and perpetuated from generation to generation .
dipping one hand carelessly over the chariot 's edge . the king brought up a string of rare carved [male] with a jewelled clasp . and , smiling at [male] 's wonder , dipped his hand a second time . when out came a garland of exquisite flowers , sea lilies , sea roses . sea narcissus , sea violets there were , larger and more beautiful than any upon land .
and would you believe it , in less than five hundred short seconds . she held the splinter under the bear 's nose so he could see it . for the bear was very near sighted and could not even see the end of his toes . `` dear me , '' sighed little [male] , `` i wish i were safe at home with mother , '' she set out once more , and by and by she came to candy town .
the years passed like the wind for [female] . and she grew into a lovely woman , with a knowledge of many things that she would never have learned in her native village . but [female] was still the same young girl that she had been on the day of her first meeting with [female] . each morning they both worked for an hour at reading and writing . as they had always done , and [female] was anxious to learn all she could .
this story is also told by [male] of newbury . who places it in the reign of king [male] . he says he long hesitated to believe it . but was at length overcome by the weight of evidence . according to him , the place where the children appeared .
the king governed himself by her advice . and would even sometimes hold a council in her apartment , the news of this change in the princess spread everywhere . the young princes of the neighboring kingdoms strove all they could to gain her favor . and almost all of them asked her in marriage . but she found not one of them had sense enough for her .
we had been crossing the forest -- night had overtaken us . we had climbed in a thick leaved tree -- it was raining . the woods were infested by bears and wolves . we had a little food , possibly enough to stave off starvation till daylight . then came by the beasts of the forest , wonderful , human beasts , who passed at the foot of our tree .
a blue summer sky , with white fleecy clouds floating beneath it . hung over a hill green to the very top , and alive with streams darting down its sides toward the valley below . on the face of the hill strayed a flock of sheep feeding . attended by a shepherd and two dogs , a little way apart . a girl stood with bare feet in a brook .
on one island the seafarers found three magic apples . and each apple gave sufficient food for forty nights . again , on another island , they found the same apples . in another place still , a great bird like a cloud arrived . with a tree larger than an oak in its claws .
all this bustle , however , ended in nothing but confusion . and , what was worse , the king soon fell back into the same condition as he was in before . prince [male] , who loved his father very dearly . was so unhappy at this that he persuaded himself that he might succeed where the others had failed . and at once prepared himself for a more distant search , in spite of the opposition he met with .
the fourteenth law of the frisons ordered that the discovery of murders should be made by means of divining rods used in church . these rods should be laid before the altar , and on the sacred relics . after which god was to be supplicated to indicate the culprit , this was called the lot of rods . or tan teen , the [female] of rods , but the middle ages was the date of the full development of the superstition . and the divining [female] was believed to have efficacy in discovering hidden treasures .
and at this the hearts of nine men in ten leapt in their breasts for longing of her . and in the tenth for longing of [female] or clarimond or [female] or [female] . and all went to the chase thinking as much of the morrow as of the day . then [female] saw a sunset pretending to be a spindle tree . scattering flecks of red and yellow light upon the ground .
the prince , charmed by these words , and still more by the manner in which they were spoken . knew not how to find words for the [male] in his heart . he assured her that he loved her better than his own self . their speech after this was not very coherent ; they gazed at one another for longer stretches than they talked . but if eloquence lacked , there was plenty of love .
`` if we make a fire , perhaps she will see it , '' said one of the men , and they lit a fire . and then went , one this way , and one that , through the forest . to look for her , whispering to each other that if she had been killed by a lion they would be sure to find some trace of it . or if she had fallen asleep , the sound of their voices would wake her .
but in the very middle of their spritely dance , suddenly all became still , the music ceased . and the whole company hurried to the slits of the doors . mouse holes , and everywhere else where there was a corner to slip into , the bride pair . the heralds , and dancers , looked upwards to a hole that was in the ceiling of the hall . and there discovered the face of the old countess , who overflowing with curiosity .
corn plume desired to keep bean [male] forever close to him . he bent his tall plumed head to her . her arms wound round and round the young chieftain . and corn plume was content , so closely were the arms of corn plume and the bean [male] entwined . so truly were they wed , that the indians never attempted to separate them .
eager to find out where this light came from , and seeing his way more clearly now . he hastened on , and soon arrived at the mouth of a large cave . which , inside , was as bright as day , he ventured farther forward and peered round a buttress of rock . and there , in the centre of the cave , a strange sight met his eyes . a gigantic bird was standing there , getting ready to fly through the farther opening overlooking the valley .
then , [male] , you must come with me . but [male] can not move until he gets nice and fat like you . run in , little daughter , and get some more nuts and raisins for him . i like plump little bodies like yours ! sister dear , have a care .
she said that that was impossible ; they had sold her and the prince had bought her . in life and in death , bones and ashes . but the snake would not listen and made for the prince to eat him . his wife however kept in front of the snake and would not let it pass . she called the banyan tree to witness that the snake should not eat her husband without first killing her .
when the bird came to carry up the dinner , no cook was there . in its distress the bird threw the wood here and there . called and searched , but no cook was to be found , owing to his carelessness the wood caught fire . so that a conflagration ensued , the bird hastened to fetch water . and then the bucket dropped from his claws into the well .
the path was becoming rocky and difficult for the wheels of the chariot to pass over . and presently a deep gulf appeared at their feet which was too wide for them to leap . so [female] took a small square of green cloth from her pocket and threw it upon the ground . at once it became the magic carpet . and unrolled itself far enough for all the cavalcade to walk upon , the chariot now advanced .
all that day there was exploring by small companies , and on the next the archbishop landed in solemn procession . the boats from the ships all met at early morning . near the shore , the sight bringing together a crowd of islanders on the banks . men , women , and children . who , with an instinct that something of importance was to happen .
here the sparks had turned into two little fishes with golden scales . and one was so exactly like the other that everyone could tell at the first glance that they must be twins . early one morning the emperor 's fishermen went down to the river to get some fish for their master 's breakfast . and cast their nets into the stream , as the last star twinkled out of the sky they drew them in . and among the multitude of fishes lay two with scales of gold .
the darkness was clear as glass , the sky seemed shaken as if with fire flies . not a sound stirred now , not even a hovering wing . nod heaped high the huge fire , and followed the [male] into his hut . but not to sleep , he crouched on his snug dry bed of moss . and waited patiently till battle 's snores rose slow and mournful beneath the snow piled roof .
they never came back , maybe they got too fat , like the cattle . as for [male] o'neary , he had cattle and sheep all his days to his heart 's content . [male] of the golden hair was the son of [male] the hundred fighter . one day as he stood with his father on the royal hill of usna . he saw a lady a little way off .
after a while , the wolves took to little [male] very kindly . and seeming to understand his outcast condition , they would always leave something for him to eat . by and by they began to talk with him , and to inquire into his history . when he told them that he had been forsaken by his brother and his sister . the wolves turned about to each other , lifted up their eyes to heaven , and wondered among themselves .
and , behold , he spurred the piebald horse . pulled tight the bridle , and again slackened it , the piebald shot up into the air like an arrow . and , having reached a good height , it came down with the swineherd on its back in one bold swoop . and jumped into the [organization] full of boiling lead without a single hair of him getting hurt . seeing this , the fairies at once lifted him out , tore his dirty clothes from him .
the nobles all agreed and the king sent for his daughters . the princesses , still thinking of the unknown knight , were not enthusiastic over this arrangement . but not to shame their father they , too , agreed , so each of the girls . dressed in her loveliest , took a golden apple in her hand and went up to a balcony . first [female] threw down her apple , it rolled straight to the feet of [male] but he turned quickly aside and it rolled on to a handsome youth who snatched it up with joy and stepped from the line .
and receiving permission they began to dig , and when the messengers had almost undermined the capitol they stole away as secretly as they had come . and next morning the stone gave way . and the sacred statue fell on its face and was broken , and the senators knew that their greed had been their ruin . from that day things went from bad to worse , and every morning crowds presented themselves before the emperor . complaining of the robberies , murders , and other crimes that were committed nightly in the streets .
so they came to a watering place where there were many strangers . and amongst them was a princess , who was troubled with seeing too well ; and that was so alarming ! she directly observed that the stranger who had just come was quite a different sort of person to all the others , he has come here in order to get his beard to grow . they say , but i see the real cause , he can not cast a shadow .
he had not been dead at all -- or buried either , his grand funeral had been a mere pretense . a wax figure having been put in his place . while he himself was spirited away under charge of these two . the condemned woman and the black man , the latter was deaf and dumb . so could neither tell nor repeat anything , when they reached the foot of the tower .
here there was bitter cold and snow storms , while in [location] there was burning [male] and oppressive heat . yet , when a clear frosty day came , and [male] saw the swans flying in numbers from the sea towards the land . across to norre vosborg , it seemed to him that people could breathe more freely here . the summer also in this part of the world was splendid . in imagination he saw the heath [male] and become purple with rich juicy berries .
and over and around all these cliffs and rocks crawl entangled tendrils and weeds . trees grow there also , but the wind 's power is so great that trees have to transform themselves into clinging vines . that they may get a firm hold on the steep precipices . the oaks creep along on the ground , while their foliage hangs over them like a low ceiling . and long limbed beeches stand in the ravines like great leaf tents .
so [male] sat down on the edge of the hole . and grasped the dream 's shadowy fingers in his , then they pushed themselves off the edge . and down they went through the darkness , [male] felt so frightened for a minute that he quite lost his breath . but he held on tight to the dream 's fingers . and soon they landed , as softly and lightly as a feather , right in the nursery of aunt [female] 's house .
[female] , who heard the noise of the horses feet , at once guessed the arrival of the robbers . and resolved to make one effort for his life , he rushed to the door . and no sooner saw the door open , than he ran out and threw the leader down . but could not escape the other robbers , who with their scimitars soon deprived him of life .
and while they listened , suddenly the king and queen . [female] and [female] , and a great company were around them . they would have knelt to [organization] , but he would not allow it . but while he witnessed the father 's and mother 's joy over their son . suddenly he remembered his own father , left alone in a distant land .
now that she was poor , none of the former rich folks . who had come to her grand dinners , would look at her , she had even to beg her bread on the streets . for who wanted to help the woman who wasted wheat ? she was glad to go to the cow stalls . and eat what the cattle left , before the year ended , she was found dead in a stable . in rags and starvation , thus her miserable life ended .
and again they all shouted with spite and ill will , and the poor moon crouched down . and wished she was dead and done with , and they fought and squabbled what they should do with her . till a pale gray light began to come in the sky ; and it drew nigh the dawning . and when they saw that , they were feared lest they should not have time to work their will . and they caught hold of her , with horrid bony fingers .
she laughed and laughed , and when all the rest of the people in the palace saw the toad arriving mounted on the lamb 's back and driving him like a horse they laughed too . the lamb went meekly home to his pasture and from that day to this when one wishes to speak of meekness one says `` as meek as a lamb . '' once upon a time there was a large handsome stag with great branching horns . one day he said to himself . i am tired of having no home of my own , and of just living anywhere .
ku yum 's mind had been in a state of wonder concerning the boy . [male] , ever since he had been born , why was he so very small and so very noisy ? what made his fingers and toes so pink ? why did her mother always smile and sing whenever she had the baby in her arms ? why did her father , when he came in from his vegetable garden . gaze so long at [male] ? why did grandmother make so much [male] over him ?
from that time on , the monk of the yangtze kiang lived in a pagoda in [location] . and was known as huan [male] , when the emperor issued the order calling the priests of [male] to court . he was some twenty years of age . he came into the emperor 's presence . and the latter honored him as a great teacher , then he set out for [location] .
the weather did change , it began to thaw . and as the warmth increased , the snow man decreased , he said nothing and made no complaint . which is a sure sign , one morning he broke and sank down altogether , and behold ! where he had stood , something that looked like a broomstick remained sticking up in the ground . it was the pole round which the boys had built him .
so she ran to the wife of [female] and borrowed a measure . knowing [female] poverty , the sister was curious to find out what sort of grain his wife wished to measure . and artfully put some suet at the bottom of the measure . [female] wife went home and set the measure on the heap of gold . and filled it and emptied it often , to her great content .
but as soon as ever he came , the king caught him by the collar and pitched him out of doors . and then the north wind caught him up and carried him off . so when there was an end of him , the king went into the castle . and at first his queen did not know him , he was so [male] and thin . through wandering so far and being so woeful ; but when he shewed her the ring .
thus glided away years , and her hopes of leaving the upper world had nearly vanished . when it chanced one day , that one of the children . playing behind a stack of corn , found a seal skin , delighted with his prize . he ran with breathless eagerness to display it before his mother . her eyes glistened with delight at the view of it .
it was a few feet in height and was built of stone . the fire was placed on the top of it . and served the double purpose of preparing the daily meals , and consuming the family sacrifices . round this domestic hearth or altar were gathered the various members of the family . the head of the house occupying the place of honour nearest the hearth .
when [female] the peasant 's son awoke . the emperor took him by his white hands . led him into the palace , thanked him for the services he had rendered . and being himself far advanced in years , he placed the crown upon [male] 's head . then [male] mounted the throne , and ruled happily , and lived with his wife for many years in the greatest harmony and love .
then the rajah and the ranee and [female] lal all went back to the palace together . and there was great rejoicing , but when the fakir 's wife and her daughter heard that [female] was still alive . and that her husband had found her , they were so frightened that they ran away and hid themselves in the deep forest . and no one has ever heard of them again from that day to this . a long piece of cotton or silk cloth .
the village children listened attentively , and the dryad no less attentively . she became a school child with the rest , in the clouds that went sailing by she saw . picture by picture , everything that she heard talked about . the cloudy sky was her picture book . she felt so happy in beautiful [female] , the fruitful land of genius .
but presently his high mood was dashed , the company sat down to meat , and the guest was treated to two more disturbing surprise . the cook came forward to serve the food , when the sheriff beheld in him his own former servant . and one whom he supposed was at the moment in the scullery at nottingham . much the miller 's son grinned by way of answer to the sheriff 's amazement . and served the plates , and placed them before the party .
but presently she came to a huge heap of stones . piled in a slope against the wall of the cavern . on these she climbed , and soon recovered the level of the thread . only however to find , the next moment , that it vanished through the heap of stones . and left her standing on it , with her face to the solid rock .
loki came out at the mouth of the river and behold ! there was a great eagle hovering over the waves of the sea and ready to swoop down on fishes . he turned back in the river , he made a leap that took him over the net that the gods were dragging . but [male] was behind the net and he caught the [male] in his powerful hands and he held him for all the struggle that [male] made . no fish had ever struggled so before , [male] got himself free all but his tail .
the eagles young and old in agitated manner once more were circling the darkening sky . and leaning over the nest and looking down [male] was astounded by what he saw . and no less astounded than he was were a band of little people who had caught a glimpse of that rounded human arm sticking from an eagles nest with consequent and complete mystification to all , in a ring and with characteristic postures they stood gabbling among themselves and pointing up . a [male] , very [male] race .
stooping , she picked up some hard red bits of shell from the floor , crabs ', claws ! yes , now i know it 's the same , do not you know the story says . `` the best of food was cooked for poor [male] , but [male] received nothing to eat but crabs ', claws , '' the gander walked into the cage and looked it over carefully . [male] , i believe i can get rid of the wolf , ', he said .
she put it on , and went into the church and stood by the altar . suddenly came the bride and bridegroom , and seated themselves before the altar . and when the priest was just going to bless them , the bride peeped half round and saw the [female] standing there . then she stood up again , and said she would not be given away until she also had as beautiful a dress as that lady there . so they went back to the house again , and sent to ask the lady if she would sell that dress .
the spae woman 's house is on the top of a knowe . away from every place , and few ever came that way , one morning i went to the well for water . when i looked into it i saw , not my own image . but the image of a young man , i drew up my pitcher filled with water . and went back to the spae woman 's house , at noontide [female] went to the well for water .
the saracen lady accepted the offer . and the next day followed the sultan my father . who found all his retinue upon the skirts of the wood . they having spent the night in searching for him . and being very uneasy because they could not find him , they were no less rejoiced to meet with .
now , [person] 's father had on many occasions robbed gold and silver idols . and had murdered a few brethren of the holy inquisition , who , in their turn . were well known for the wicked deeds they had committed , such as burning [person] men and women who did not . and could not , profess the popish faith , but in course of time the jesuits . for so they were called , made common cause against these robbers .
in the mean time the boatman rowed with all his might , and [male] 's confidant accompanied the prince of [location] and [male] thaher walking along the side of the canal . until they came to the tigris , and when she could go no farther she took leave of them and returned . [female] thaher 's friend took all this for truth . told them they were welcome , and offered the prince of [location] . whom he knew not , all the assistance he could desire .
here the one who was their leader advanced towards me and pulled aside my veil . whereupon a great clamour instantly arose among the crew , each contending for the possession of me . the dispute upon this point grew so warm that presently they fell to fighting . and a bitter and deadly conflict was maintained till at last only a single pirate was left . this one , who now regarded himself as my owner , proceeded to inform me of what was to be my fate .
it was no use to complain whether she liked it or not . she was obliged to take the frog with her up to her little bed . so she picked him up with two fingers . hating him bitterly the while , and carried him upstairs . but when she got into bed , instead of lifting him up to her .
and so [male] and [male] had to remain in the house . and this was all the more painful , because the company cake , which was on the table . gave out the most delicious spicy odours , yet might not be cut until the cousins came , oh ! that they would only come , -- would only come , the children cried . and almost wept with impatience , at last the loud tramping of horses was heard .
but on he went nevertheless , till he could see both the seas and the citadel of corinth towering high above all the land . and he past swiftly along the isthmus , for his heart burned to meet that cruel sinis . and in a pine wood at last he met him . where the isthmus was narrowest and the road ran between high rocks . there he sat upon a stone by the wayside .
they had not taken a hundred steps when they saw two rough looking individuals sitting on a stone begging for alms . it was the fox and the cat . but one could hardly recognize them , they looked so miserable , the cat . after pretending to be blind for so many years had really lost the sight of both eyes . and the fox , old , thin , and almost hairless , had even lost his tail .
in front of the military school extends in time of peace the arena of war . a field without a blade of grass . a piece of sandy steppe , as if cut out of the desert of africa . where [female] displays her wondrous airy castles and hanging gardens . in the champ de [female] , however , these were to be seen more splendid .
when the farmer 's daughter received this message she went near the king 's palace . and having undressed herself wrapped herself up in her long hair . and then had herself placed in a net which was attached to the tail of a horse . with one hand she held a sieve over her head to shield herself from the sun . and in the other she held a platter covered with another platter .
now , little [male] , when he heard the message . rose and stood beside the king , and in his breast something thrilled and trembled like a smitten chord . but as for the hundred heralds , they were troubled as one man . though he not yet wholly a man , `` but what of the message ? '' the king asked sadly , and this none of the heralds knew how to answer .
many knights had come from afar to try their luck . but it was in vain they attempted to climb the mountain . in spite of having their horses shod with sharp nails . no one managed to get more than halfway up , and then they all fell back right down to the bottom of the steep , slippery hill . sometimes they broke an arm , sometimes a leg .
for the force with which it had been hurled from his hand when [male] made his onset was great enough to send it some distance . the king was a terribly powerful and heavy man , but he had no weapon save his own strength . [male] was slender and frail , but he held within his grasp a power that made him fearless and wise to act . the king , infuriated by [male] 's boldness . relaxed his grasp on [female] 's arm .
the rest of the kingdom of the lady birds were sitting all around the shore of the pool on mint and ferns . cheering and shouting with joy , on a fallen trunk by the water . sat a sedate group of water bugs chewing young tendrils and nodding approval with their beards . by the time the celebration was finished , evening had come and a serious brown water bug came up to invite them to visit the wood bugs mines . in a long procession , they followed him to a powerful .
i was born nigh [location] , but have worked in a shop at [location] ( what you would call manufactories . we call shops ) , almost ever since i was out of my time . i served my apprenticeship at deptford . nigh where i was born , and i am a smith by trade . my name is [person] , i have been called `` old [person] ''
`` it is the sailors , '' said they to one another . then stood and watched with terrified eyes a large boat sail majestically up the broad stream . meanwhile down from the forest had rushed the [male] with his tigress and cubs . the leopard with his leopardess and cubs . and all the other animals with their young , and all the birds , and all the insects .
whether either of these stories is true or not , it is certain that the rivals disappeared altogether from the country . unmolested , [male] now devoted all his days to minding . and randall , [male] , knut , biddulph . nero , [organization] , [male] , [male] . [male] , and his innumerable other charges never left him .
yes , it was coming from that direction , and immediately [male] was ready to offer help . he took his lantern in his hand . seized his alpenstock , and ran down the path between the rocks and the dew covered bushes . he had not far to seek , for there , on a stone by the wayside . sat a dwarf in a dark and shabby garment .
yet now she could not get out , and was compelled to follow the apple once more . it rolled far into the beautiful garden and stopped at a little fire place . where stood two kettles of water , one small , the other large , there was a great fire burning under the large kettle . but only a weak fire beneath the smaller one , now when the apple stopped there the [female] did not know what to do . then it occurred to her to scrape away the fire beneath the large kettle and thrust it under the little one .
before the scientist could conclude his sentence , another and more impatient summons sounded from without . someone with swishing skirts was marshalled hurriedly down the corridor . and the door opened on a young girl , decently dressed but disordered and red hot with haste . she had sea blown blonde hair . and would have been entirely beautiful if her cheek bones had not been , in the scotch manner .
[female] did not like to spend his money on a pair of boots for a cat . but he knew he was a wise little animal . so he did as he said , he went to a tailor . and for the three pieces of silver the tailor made him the prettiest pair of little boots that ever were seen . and when [male] drew them on they fitted exactly .
that 's the way exactly , whether it is reasonable or ridiculous to trust to the alleged experiences of thieves as narrated by themselves . in prisons , or penitentiaries , or anywhere ? in general , nothing more absurd . lying is their habit and their trade ; and they would rather lie—even if they hadn t an interest in it , and didn t want to make themselves agreeable—than tell the truth .
well , [female] went to the land where the sun sets . a story is soon told , but a deed 's not soon done , he passed three kingdoms . and went to the serpent 's land ; before the gates of the town he saw a beggar . a [male] , blind old man with a crutch . and giving him charity , he asked if the young tsarevna [male] golden tress was in that town .
he slept long , and when he awoke he sat up on his bed of leaves and looked about him to see who was with him . he saw no one within the hut . and no one at the doorway , little children do not like to be quite alone . [male] listened to hear if there were any voices outside , but he heard nothing but the rush of a waterfall close by . and the distant cry of sheep and lambs .
then there came a wind , so strong that it blew off [male] 's hat . and away it flew over the hills : and he was forced to turn and run after it . till , by the time he came back , she had done combing and curling her hair . and had put it up again safe , then he was very angry and sulky . and would not speak to her at all ; but they watched the geese until it grew dark in the evening .
now the servant came into the kitchen , and when she saw the salad standing there ready cooked she was about to carry it up . but on the way , according to her old habit , she tasted it and ate a couple of leaves . immediately the charm worked , and she became a donkey . and ran out to join the old witch , and the dish with the salad in it fell to the ground . in the meantime , the messenger was sitting with the lovely [female] .
during the night , whilst all were asleep , [person] conducted the [person] across the snow and fields of ice to the mountains . the moon and stars , which always seem brightest in the cold winter 's night . lighted them on their way , they had brought with them some clothes and furs . but that was all they could carry , they climbed the mountains the whole night long . till they arrived at a solitary spot completely encircled by rock .
one of her instructors was [female] , and she is said by some critics to have appropriated his peculiarities as a colorist and his shortcomings in drawing . without attaining his geniality and power of divination . in 1891 her portrait of count [male] moltke . begun shortly before his death and finished afterward , was sent to the international exposition at [location] . but was rejected , the emperor , however , bought it for his private collection .
so they agreed to this , and he carried her in his arms . because , he said she was so tired , she was asleep . and laid her in a bed ; he charged the men not to disturb her . and went himself to sleep in the next room , in the middle of the night he heard the men calling out . for they smelt a horrid smell .
still , in the sweet nights of summer , the children of the woods come hand in hand to the pine tree by moonlight . slipping their slim dark feet upon the moss , and tossing back their long green hair . the children of the water come by moonlight . all drenching wet their sleeves , and the bright drops fall from their finger tips . the children of the air rest in the pine tree 's branches .
the incense from her altars blew out , in heavy sweetness . to meet the bitter-sweet [female] of the seaweed that was carried in by the tide . for [female] prayed on , fearful , yet hoping that her prayers might still keep safe her man . her king -- her lover , she busied herself in laying out the garments he would wear on his return . and in choosing the clothes in which she might be fairest in his eyes .
then they went on further till they came to a lake . in which a great many ducks were swimming about , the two wanted to catch and roast a pair . but the blockhead would not allow it , and said : leave the creatures alone . you shall not kill them , at last they came to a [person] 's nest . containing such a quantity of honey that it flowed round the trunk of the tree .
the youngest of the princesses felt herself suddenly cheered , and so powerfully attracted to the metamorphosed swineherd . that in spite of his peasant 's dress she threw her arms around his neck . the king immediately decided that he should become her husband . and the following morning the wedding was celebrated with the utmost magnificence . in presence of the whole court , at the golden palace in the forest .
when [male] saw his brother arrive . with all this splendour and luxury , he wished to know what good fortune had befallen him . then [male] told him of the youths whom he had met in the inn . and of the present they had made him ; but he kept to himself his conversation with the youths . march , who heard himself thus slandered , suppressed his anger till the morning .
`` who are you ? '' asked uncle [male] , getting up from his chair and going over to the door . and then the little voice spoke again , `` i am little [male] sprite . '' so the old gentleman bunny opened the door . and there stood the prettiest little fairy you ever saw , he was dressed in blue . with a tiny green cap on his head , and long pointed turned up shoes .
the inhuman little savage confessed , shortly after , that she had adopted that nefarious plan . in order that , by meeting together , we might -- how , she did not care . come to some explanation with regard to the duality of our attachment . and the double duplicity of our tipperary [female] , and now to return -- it 's a long way back . but never mind , i am riding an old hack ; few that 's used to such journeys .
the commotion in the sea was so terrible that the king and his daughter . who by this time had come down to the shore dressed like a bride . in white , ready to be thrown to the monster -- and all his courtiers . and all the country folk , were fain to take refuge on the hill top . out of harm 's way , and stand and see what happened next .
[female] being a young man of good address . and of a good air , this minister was very civil to him . especially when he heard him give such just and pertinent answers to what was asked of him . he also perceived he was learned ; therefore said to him . from what i can understand , you have travelled a great way .
the jug was very heavy , and the marionette , not being strong enough to carry it with his hands . had to put it on his head , when they arrived home . the little woman made [female] sit down at a small table and placed before him the bread . the cauliflower , and the cake , [male] did not eat , he devoured . his stomach seemed a bottomless pit .
he also added curious details regarding the lord of the forest . who had forbidden him to bite the thumbnail of his left hand . which was thicker and longer than the others , and that if he lost sight of it while in the form of a wolf he would quickly recover his human shape . when confronted with his father jean altered some of the details of his story . and it was agreed that long imprisonment and extended cross examination had worn out his already feeble intellect .
one tremendous shout now arose from the multitude , the youth has conquered ! ', they cried . `` he has actually frightened the lion back into his den ! '' rushing into the arena , they raised the absolute fool upon their shoulders and carried him in triumph to the open square in front of the palace . that he might be rewarded for his bravery , here the king . followed by his court , quickly appeared ; for he was as much delighted as any one at the victory of the young man .
when the ex king and queen were informed of what had happened , they were greatly distressed on their daughter 's account . and exerted themselves to save the life of their son in law . but the regent , in whom all authority was vested , resisted their entreaties . and only on condition of their resigning some of the few privileges which still remained to them did he consent to defer the execution till he had communicated with [male] . and learned his pleasure on the subject , he confiscated the property of [male] .
the next morning , sure enough , the princess paid a visit to the ship . which lay at a wharf below the palace , in honor of the princess 's coming . everything had been swept , scrubbed , and brightened , and gorgeous carpets from the eastern islands covered the decks . in shaded nooks , under costly tapestries , lay the treasures of the cargo . wonderful cloths and spices from the eastern islands .
) with nightmares , it is hard to keep all those dreams from getting mixed up . there are so many of them , indeed , sometimes , they do get mixed up . and a good child , who was meant to have a dream as pretty as a pansy or as funny as a frog . gets a nightmare by mistake , but the driver of the dream coach tries as hard as he possibly can never to let this happen . he has so very much to do that he never would catch up with his work no matter how quickly his beautiful horses galloped from star to star .
`` i wish -- i wish , '' began the poor girl , but her voice was choked with tears . [female] flew to the garden and brought back the finest pumpkin she could find . she could not guess what use it would be , but the fairy scooped it hollow . and then touched it with her wand , the pumpkin became at once a splendid gilt coach . in the mouse trap were six sleek mice , the fairy opened the door .
again there was a cheer , but a short one , for the spell of expectancy was on all . the young man descended into the court , and the air seemed to turn to a wavering mist as he looked up at the manor windows seeking to spy [male] 's face at one of them . was this to be the end ? could he kiss her one last good by if disaster was in store for them after all , alas ! no glimpse of her was to be seen as he moved along , hardly aware of his own steps . and the keys jingling lightly as he moved , through the crowd he passed .
the prince had nearly reached the place opposite to which the ship was moored . when the princess , who had been awakened by the noise of the combat . appeared upon the deck of the vessel , the moment she saw the prince . she felt convinced that he was certainly the one for whom she was looking . fearing that the pursuing amazons might kill him .
`` who are these two ladies ? '' asked graceful , who had never seen any women but fishermen 's wives in the hut . they are two fairies , replied his grandmother -- two powerful fairies -- the fairy of the woods and the fairy of the waters . listen to me , my child ; i am going to intrust you with a secret . a secret which you must keep as carefully as i have done , and which will give you wealth and happiness .
there is a deep dub , or pool , on ballacoan stream . which the children of laxey call [person] 's . it is the home of [person] . the water goblin , it has no bottom . and brambles and ferns are growing round it .
as you may imagine , the princess did not get much sleep that night . for she was naturally in a great fever of excitement thinking about who the knight would be . one thing she was sure about , and that was , that if she did not like him she would not have anything to do with him . even if she had to forfeit her kingdom , however that might be , she did not sleep that night . and on the morrow she felt quite tired , she dressed herself in her most splendid robes .
his eyes sparkled with life , and a smile played upon his lips . he walked with a light and quick step . his forehead was bound with a wreath of sweet grass . in place of the warrior 's frontlet . and he carried a bunch of flowers in his hand .
blue beard returned from his journey the same evening . and said , he had received letters upon the road . informing him that the affair he went about was ended to his advantage . his wife did all she could to convince him she was extremely glad of his speedy return . next morning he asked her for the keys .
a few days afterwards her husband came home , having got tired of working as a servant . and , putting a bold face on it , he went up to her and said that now he was going to beat her . all the retainers who had accompanied him when he set out to trade and also the servant whom the princess had sent with him were present . then , before them all , the princess took up the old loin cloth and asked him if he knew to whom it had belonged . at this reminder of his poverty the prince was dumb with shame .
at one time there must have been a lot of water coming down from a spring . because the stream bed was wide in some places and deep in others as it cut a path down the hill . but now it was dry most of the time , except when it rained . when the water would come churning down the hill , bubbling past the rocks and washing the leaves down hill . then after the rain ended , it would stop flowing .
the blow he had given [male] ad deen was intended to make him obey the more readily . and give him the lamp as soon as he should ask for it . but his too great precipitation , and his fear lest somebody should come that way during their dispute . and discover what he wished to keep secret , produced an effect quite contrary to what he had proposed to himself . when the african magician saw that all his hopes were frustrated forever , he returned the same day for africa .
it won t be took as boastful in me . if i make the remark ( for i can t put down what i have got to say . without putting that down before going any further ) , that i have always been of an ingenious turn . i once got twenty pound by a screw . and it 's in use now , i have been twenty year .
[female] flushed , `` now i think you ought to let me tell , '' she began , with downcast eyes , and so she told . how she had come there , and how she had stayed , like the little mouse under the queen 's chair . and how glad she was to have seen from a distance a little of this splendour and great society . and how gladder still to hang her borrowed white and silver away and be done with it and all it stood for and go back to her gown of crash and her chimney corner place in life .
so he followed her in , and found the house was all gold inside it . and brightly lighted , and the fairies were dancing and singing , and they brought him anything he wanted for supper . and then they put him to bed . [male] slept heavily , and when he awoke turned round . for he felt very cold , and his body seemed covered with prickles .
the wee woman looked each morning to see if the magic of the flower had begun to work but morning after morning nothing changed . `` it is long waiting and weary watching for magic things to work , '' said she to herself ; but because of what her fairy godmother had told her . she tended the flower from day to day . and hoped in her heart that something might come of it yet .

but it was only a balcony , here stood old flower pots with faces and asses ears , and the flowers grew just as they liked . one of the pots was quite overrun on all sides with pinks . that is to say , with the green part ; shoot stood by shoot . and it said quite distinctly , the air has cherished me .
so she gathered as many dry pieces of wood as she could find . and made them into a pile near at hand . and setting them alight , she soon had a brisk fire burning . before long she heard the sound of feet in the brushwood . and there came fair brother , running as hard as he could go , with the breath sobbing in and out of his body .

they all found places on the grassy bank . the giant will o'dreams lying down beside everychild like a true friend , they had no sooner taken their places than it was really night . insects in the forest about them made a droning sound . a distant bell rang faintly , one by one the members of the band fell asleep . all save everychild , he alone was wakeful , and he knew that the masked lady had taken a step forward and was looking down at him .
[male] hurried home , he slipped into the house . he took out of his pocket miss cockroach . master [female] , [female] , the harp . and the stool , and arranged them in a corner of the room . telling them to remain quiet until he came back , then he went into the kitchen .
and now they were at home , but the poor duckling which had crept last out of the egg . and looked so ugly , was bitten and pushed and jeered , as much by the ducks as by the chickens . so it went on the first day ; and afterward it became worse and worse . the poor duckling was hunted about by everyone : even its brothers and sisters were quite angry with it . and said : `` if the cat would only catch you , you ugly creature ! ''
the woman took the child up and nursed him . and after that he was to her as her own son , she named him [female] . and made a little suit of clothes and a cloth cap for him to wear . one day [male] put on his little coat and went out in a boat to fish on the river . the boat floated up to the shore ; [male] took the cake and went back to his fishing again .

formal divorce or separation does not exist , a husband who wants to get rid of his wife will make her life so miserable that she runs away from him . but more usually the separation originates with the wife , who , not liking or being tired of her husband . or being in love elsewhere , will run away and elope altogether with another man . in such a case , the husband may retaliate on that other man in the way already mentioned . but that is rather the method adopted in cases of incidental adultery .

between them hung wreaths and sprays of flowers such as [female] had never before seen . all around crowds of wonderful little dwarfs stood gazing at him full of curiosity . in the centre of the hall stood a throne of green transparent stone . with cushions of soft mushrooms , on this sat the gnome king . around him was thrown a golden mantle , and on his head was a crown cut from a flaming carbuncle .
that dance danced , they sat quiet awhile . battle softly , very softly , thrumming on his juddie , gazing into the fire . and suddenly in the silence , out of the vast blackness of the moonlit leagues beneath them . broke a strange and dismal cry , it rose lone and hollow . and yet it seemed with its sound to fill the whole enormous bowl of star bedazzling sky above the forest .
the little fellow was in the greatest trouble , and searched and looked about everywhere . but how could he learn who had the bell ? for only on a very few days in the year may they come up to the daylight . nor can they then appear in their true form , he had turned himself into every form of birds . beasts , and men ; and he had sung and rung . and groaned and moaned , and lamented and inquired about his bell , but not the slightest tidings .
it was a throne room , used for the reception of foreign ambassadors . when the king , which of late had not been often , consented to give them a personal audience . the same room in which , many years before , envoys had appeared from england to make arrangements for the marriage of their queen . then one of the catholic sovereigns of [location] , with the emperor 's eldest son . the hangings were of gilt cordovan leather .
on the opening day the high king . attended by the four kings of erin , set out from the palace . and with them went the queen and the ladies of the court in sparkling chariots . the princess rode in the chariot with the high queen . under an awning made of the wings of birds .

then [female] cut off the first head , and after that the others . but the last was the toughest of them all , and it was the hardest work that [male] had ever done to get it off . but he still believed that he would have strength enough to do it . and now all the princesses came to the castle , and were together again , and they were happier than they had ever been in their lives . and they were delighted with [male] , and he with them .
in winter it requires no small pluck to go through this penance . yet i have seen a penitent submit to it for more than a quarter of an hour on a bitterly cold day in january . in summer , on the other hand , the religious exercise called hiyakudo . or `` the hundred times , '' which may also be seen here to advantage . is no small trial of [male] , it consists in walking backwards and forwards a hundred times between two points within the sacred precincts .

how it was nobody could tell , but from the hour of that discourse the great lord cast away his melancholy . and went about with a noble train , making merry in his hall . where all travelers were entertained and all the poor were welcome , this strange story soon spread through the north country . and a great company came to the cobbler 's hut . rich men who had lost their money , poor men who had lost their friends .
so there is nothing but emptiness in the old house where [female] lived with jean . three hundred and sixty years or so before you were born , it is a high old house . and wide , with the broken slates still on the roof , at the corner there are little round towers . like pepperboxes , with sharp peaks , the stems of the ivy that covers the walls are as thick as trees . there are many trees crowding all round , and there are hills round it too .
[male] , '' said the crow , `` you have been extremely generous to succour me . who am but a poor wretched crow ; but i am not ungrateful and will do you as good a turn .

morgiana , meanwhile , sought an apothecary and asked him for some lozenges . my poor master , she said , can neither eat nor sleep . and no one knows what his distemper is , she carried home the lozenges and returned next day weeping . and asked for an essence only given to those just about to die , thus , in the evening . no one was surprised to hear the wretched shrieks and cries of [male] 's wife and [male] telling every one that [male] was dead .
incensed at the obstinacy and stupidity of the phrygian king . [male] punished him by giving him the ears of an ass .

after some time had passed the man had a mind to visit his second eldest daughter . his wife again gave him some dry bread to eat . and when he grew tired and hungry he sat down on the east side of a mound and began to eat it . as he sat there his daughter came up out of the mound . and invited him to come inside , which he did very willingly .
he had now diminished to the proper dimensions of an elf . when evening came , therefore , all the glow worms assembled round him on the moss to swear fealty to him . the peers of the realm brought with them a crown of pure star light ore . very delicately and tastefully wrought , with which they solemnly crowned [male] , and no sooner was the crown placed on his head . than in a moment , as if by magic touch .
after all , mother [female] was not there the next morning , -- nor the next . nor the next , she did not come back for days and days and days . much happened before she returned , and much happened after , i will tell you . during the days the children roamed the forest looking for their mother . they asked every one they could find whether he had seen her .
a wonderful thing happened one night ; those who never heard of it before will hardly believe it . [female] was lying in her little cradle with her eyes wide open , and she was trying to make up her mind whether she should go to sleep or keep awake . this is often a hard matter for little people to determine , [female] was ready for sleep and dreams . she had on her nightgown and her nightcap , and her mother had kissed her good night . but the day had been so very pleasant , with its [female] and its play and its many other diversions .
onwards , onwards , it was no good standing still . but the effort was greater with every step , now the green forest had received them within its thickness . immense trees looked down upon them waving their branches . whispering together , astonished at the sight of two such defenceless travellers venturing themselves within their dreaded obscurity . the snow lay thick on the ground .
while over the child was spread , as it were , a net of shining stars . and each star was a [male] of happiness . all the good stars of life had brought their gifts to the newly born . here sparkled health , wealth , fortune , and love . in short , there seemed to be everything for which man could wish on earth .

now perhaps the princess could make a guess at it . there the drummer had her as tight as a fly in a bottle . for she did not dare to let folks know that she was a wicked witch like the one-eyed one . so all she could do was to sit there and gnaw her lip , as for the book of knowledge . it was no more use to her than a fifth wheel under a cart .
at this the farmer was very angry , the wicked elves take you ! i wish -- but the words were not all out of his mouth before the horses had gone . leaving the harness dangling to the carriage , the farmer was indeed angry now . but there was nothing to be done about it , and he knew that he had but one wish left and he wanted to make that one very carefully . so he packed the harness on his back .
as the years went by [female] became first a big girl and then a grown-up woman . and still she had to work for her living , she lived in a good many different places . sometimes with nice people and sometimes with people who were not kind to her . but wherever she lived she had to [female] and [female] . and get up early and go to bed late , she still kept her box of dreams safely in her little trunk .
but on a bare plain , where nothing grew . a miracle had come to pass : a peasant , returning home one starry night . had espied , from the road upon which he was slowly sauntering , a strange light in the form of a cross . gleaming far over the barren waste , full of astonishment he had run to the spot . and there he had discerned a magic crystal , all charged with [male] .
upon this , [male] sprang into the arena sword in hand . and with two blows cut off the heads of the lion and the bull . `` what do you think of that ?

in case that he might wish to embalm it and hang it up in his baronial hall as a trophy of heartlessness and cruelty. the message was instantly delivered to the laird , who could not believe that such a diabolical deed could be perpetrated by any of his clan . but still he came out to see , on his appearance in the court . [male] og dismounted , did obeisance to his chief . and prominently exhibited the dripping head by lifting it up on his [male] .
so she gave him rich dainties whenever he fed . and erected a monument when he was dead , who saw him die ? i , said the fly , with my little eye . i saw him die , who caught his blood ? i , said the fish . with my little dish , i caught his blood , who will carry him to the grave ?
the old woman watched her opportunity to put it into his hands as he was coming from the council chamber . where he presided that day in his turn . the prince took it , and reading it . fell into such a rage , that , without giving himself time to finish it . he drew his sabre and punished the old woman as she deserved .

when [male] returned to [location] with these dreadful tidings . the emperor was beside himself with anger . and ordered [male] to fight a duel with [male] . who was the elder of the two , and bid him take heed not to spare him . as [male] was young and slight , and [male] one of the strongest men at the court .
in the meantime , everything was prepared with the greatest magnificence in the sultan 's palace to celebrate the princess 's nuptials . and the evening was spent with all the usual ceremonies and great rejoicings . no sooner had the bride and bridegroom slipped away from the company . however , than the genie , as the faithful slave of the lamp . and punctual in executing the command of those who possessed it , to the great amazement of them both .
it was on this green floating prison that [female] awoke . frightened and puzzled , with the first rays of the sun , she stood up straight on the leaf . looking about her for a way of escape , and , finding none . she sat down again and began to weep bitterly , at length her sobs were heard by the old frog . who was busy in her house at the bottom of the marsh .
at first they stoned him , but his music made the stones fall harmless at his feet . then in a frenzy of cruelty , with the maniac lust to cause blood to flow . to know the joy of taking life , they threw themselves upon [male] and did him to death . from limb to limb they tore him . casting at last his head and his blood stained lyre into the river .
so only a single sprout shot up , the little brother was hard-working and industrious by nature . and hence he watered and hoed the sprout all day long . and the sprout grew mightily , like a tree , and an ear of [male] sprang up out of it like a canopy . large enough to shade half an acre of ground , in the fall the ear was ripe . then the little brother took his ax and chopped it down .
what were the lost boys to do in this terrible plight , when their leader was far away ? fortunately , one of them remembered [male] 's plan . whenever he was attacked by wild beasts [male] used to run at them backwards . jumping along the ground , squinting at them through his legs . the lost boys did this all together , and really , it was so astonishing that the wolves fled with terrified howls to the thickets where they lived .
[male] told them that [male] had been killed by the people of the north . and thus their wars began -- [female] must be avenged , they have also a legend in regard to head taking . the moon , a woman called `` kabigat , '' was sitting one day making a copper pot . and one of the children of the man [male] .

in part only was [female] now her child . for while half her heart was in the [female] . rejoicing in the beauties of earth , the other half was with the god who had taken her down to the land of darkness and there had won her for his own . back to the flowery island of sicily her mother brought her . and the peach trees and the almonds blossomed snowily as she passed .
so the prince went away with a heavy heart , and started on his travels once more . he travelled far , and visited many cities , and wherever he went he was received with the greatest favour . for no one had ever seen so handsome a prince , and many kings offered him their daughters in marriage . but the prince turned a deaf ear now to their offers . and he was sad at heart , for he felt that the magic gift which he had received brought him no happiness .
night and mist stopped him after many miles of journeying . the postboy had lost his way , and could offer no suggestions . brown descended to see if by chance , in this wild place . they were near any farm house at which he could ask the way . standing tiptoe upon a bank , it seemed as if he could see in the distance a light feebly glimmering .

meanwhile the queen , on her arrival home . had again consulted her mirror , and received the same answer as twice before . this made her tremble and foam with rage and jealousy , and she swore that [female] should die if it cost her her own life . thereupon she went into an inner secret chamber where no one could enter . and made an apple of the most deep and subtle poison , outwardly it looked nice enough .
`` beasts and birds o '' each degree , clean me this stable for love o ', me . and , lo and behold , in a minute the beasts of the fields came trooping . and the sky was just dark with the wings of birds . and they carried away the [person] , and the stable was clean as a new pin before the evening .

once more all was still in the barren marches ; and now the lovely lady . bride [female] , peeped joyously from her window to watch her bridesman grow mild . now that he had done with slaying spite upon the earth , soon the wounds healed upon the gallants . for they had good luck to help them . and the orphans recovered still more quickly , because hardship is a good school .
he was happy with us -- as happy as the days were long . we wove for him garments of silken [male] . and taught him to call [location] by the sweet name of `` mother . '' ... one day he begged [location] to let him play on the hill . so we took him thither , hiding close by , that we might guard him from harm .
but just as he leaped and jumped , he got upon the bridge over the moor again . and from it he had to jump over a bog hole on to a turf that he might not soil his shoes . but plump it went , and down it went under him . and there was no stopping till he found himself in a nasty . deep , dark hole , at first he could see nothing .
knowing that stirabout was the main food of the hag . [female] settled in her mind to play another trick . taking a bag she scraped the chimney . gathered about a stone of soot , and took it with her . the night was dark and rainy , when she reached the hag 's house .
i have always observed that what is proposed as a little dance invariably ends in a great one . for from the time of proposing till the cards are about , it increases like a snow ball . but that arises , perhaps , from the extreme difficulty of knowing when to draw the line between friends and acquaintances . i have also observed that when your wife and daughters intend such a thing . they always obtain permission for the ball first .
when his father did not return , the child began to cry , and [male] heard him and came down . and to frighten the boy and make him leave the jungle he came in the guise of a leopard . but the child would not move from where he was ; then [male] appeared as a bear . and as a snake and an elephant and in many other forms but the child would not move . so at last [female] took the form of an old woman .
there stood in the farm yard an old man , who knew how to make shaving soap and soap for washing . in square cakes as well as in round balls . he was a merry , wandering old man . when he saw the sparrow that the boys had caught . and which , as they said , they did not care about at all , he asked .
so saying the stranger desired him to shut his eyes . throw himself on the ground facing the sun . and then retire two steps backwards , when [male] had done so . the stranger told him to look at himself . [male] was amazed at seeing himself attired in a costly dress .
so the month wore on , and [female] began to feel that the burgh . where now his brothers only came to sleep , was a dead shell , too desolate to inhabit if [male] did not soon return . and he was impelled to go in search of him . yet decided to remain until [male] 's birthday had dawned , for had not their birthdays brought his three youngest brothers home ? and it might be so with [male] , and so it was .
the beard of the enchanter bristled like spikes on a hedgehog . and the balls of his eyes stuck out of his head . the king 's son plucked the three hairs of his beard before he could lift a hand or say a word . `` mount the slight red steed and be off , the two of you , '' said the enchanter . they crossed the river of the ox .
the poor mother went sadly over the snow , by night . over the fields , she came to a wide stubble field . and there she was so overcome by the cold that she could go no farther . so she took the kindling wood out of her bag . scraped the snow aside , and fit a fire to warm herself by .
from this time the little cook was hardly seen except in the kitchen . where , surrounded by his helpers , he gave orders . baked , stewed , flavoured and dished up all manner of dishes , the prince had been a fortnight with the grand duke . and enjoyed himself mightily , they ate five times a day . and the duke had every reason to be content with the dwarf 's talents .
they called to him to come back , but he ran on . and was about to fling himself boldly into the undergrowth , when as by magic all the great trees . the shrubs , the creepers , the ivies . briars and brambles , unlaced themselves of their own accord and drew aside to let him pass . he found himself within a long glade or avenue .
rather reluctantly , [male] ; and next day he set off for the palace at orphir . leaving his lady love behind him , little he guessed the danger he was in ! for , all unknown to him , his step aunt , countess [female] . had chanced to be in the hall , the evening before , hidden behind a curtain . and she had overheard every word that [male] and he had spoken .
so she took the golden knot in her fingers . and pried into its intricacies as sharply as she could , almost without intending it . or quite knowing what she was about , she was soon busily engaged in attempting to undo it . meanwhile , the bright [female] came through the open window ; as did likewise the merry voices of the children . playing at a distance , and perhaps the voice of [female] among them .
the second night came , and up he went again and sat down by the fire . and began his old song : `` oh , if only i could learn to shudder . '' in the middle of the night a great noise and uproar began . first soft , and then growing louder ; then for a short time there would be silence . at last , with a loud scream , half the body of a man fell down the chimney in front of him .
the giant 's time had come , silently , swiftly he rose . and towered above the hills that had sheltered him , with a [male] of his mighty arm he flung out his cloak and cast it like a grey wall between the prince and the princess . deftly he caught prince [female] in its folds . and before the prince could make the least effort to free himself . the giant raised his cloak high in air .
so the prince took the shoe , and went the next day to the king . his father , and said , `` i will take for my wife the lady that this golden shoe fits . '' then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear this ; for they had beautiful feet . and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper . the eldest went first into the room where the slipper was , and wanted to try it on .
when once a woman is married , when once she has enlisted among the matrons of the land . let not her fancy dream of perpetual admiration ; let her not be sketching out endless mazes of pleasure . the [female] of a family has ceased to be a girl . she can no longer be frivolous or childish with impunity , the angel of courtship has sunk into a woman . and that woman will be valued principally as her fondness lies in retirement .
old marshelm , the captain of the guard . was much surprised when he saw the baron 's daughter and her playmates approach her father 's castle escorted by a knight in glittering armor . to be sure it was a rather small knight , but the horse he led by the bridle was so stately and magnificent in appearance that old marshelm . who was an excellent judge of horses , at once decided the stranger must be a personage of unusual importance . as they came nearer the captain of the guard also observed the beauty of the little knight 's armor .
the difficulties he met with -- huge rocks to be climbed . deep rivers to be crossed , and thorny tracts to be avoided -- only served to make his heart beat quicker . for he was really brave all through , and not merely when he could not help himself . like a great many people , but in spite of all his efforts he could not find his way out of the forest . and he began to think he should have to pass the night there .
of a certain dead dragon , the grain of sand is found and brought . and the result is that the whole of the monstrous brood of trolls or haugebasser is instantaneously destroyed . in a transylvanian saxon story a witch 's `` life '' is a light which burns in an egg . inside a duck , which swims on a pond , inside a mountain . and she dies when it is put out , in the bohemian story of `` the sun horse ''
i am returning to [location] with my wife whose health requires a change . they met at the time of the boycott of the [male] yups by the see yups . after the heat and dust and unsavoriness of the highways and byways of chinatown . the young reporter who had been sent to find a story , had stepped across the threshold of a cool . deep room , fragrant with the odor of dried lilies and sandalwood .
the prince obeyed the frog 's orders one by one . and all went well for this second time also , the gate opened , the inhabitants fell sound asleep . and he walked down the passage till he found the girl on her bed . exactly as he had been told he would , he woke her . and begged her firmly , but politely , to follow him quickly , after a little persuasion the [male] consented .
then he awoke , and stiff enough he was in all his limbs from lying on so hard a bed . twist and turn as he might . he could not get to sleep again , presently he heard something stirring in the little loft overhead . it might be rats or mice . or perhaps a cat , yes , it was certainly a cat .
the king replied , that i had shown , by sending the message i had . that i was a dutiful son , fond of my mother and father . that i had shown i did not want to give them a moment 's uneasiness and pain . his majesty then dismissed me , and placed me under the special [male] of his chancellor , prince tippin . this arrangement afforded me inexpressible satisfaction and delight .
psalms were sung , and a few of the old people shed tears . beyond this , the guests were cheerful enough , as it appeared to [female] . and there was plenty to eat and drink , eels there were of the fattest . upon which brandy should be poured to bury them , as the eel breeder said . and certainly his maxim was here carried out , [male] went to and fro in the house .
her eyes shone in it so brightly . that quite a flame had been kindled there ; and , like all other fires . it had burst forth so suddenly , that the miller 's daughter . the beautiful [female] , was quite unaware of it , [female] had never spoken a word to her on the subject . the miller was rich , and , on that account , [male] stood very high .
the giants , unlike their brethren in foreign lands . are gregarious and live under a royal dynasty , they hold assemblies . at which their king presides , several royal residences exist in székeland . near besenyö there is one that is called `` csentetetö , '' tradition has even preserved the giant king 's name . which was [male] , this king used to convoke the other giants to the assembly with huge golden bells .
[male] framed his story by introducing [location] to a madwoman in a private asylum in western england . who cornered everyone she met with her mantra . `` an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . '' the narrator then reassures the reader that there will be no more of the asylum story . but there will be the story of how the woman happened to come there ; and the reader thus knows in advance that this will be a story with a violent ending .
whether it be a good thing or a bad not to be afraid depends on what the fearlessness is founded upon . some have no fear , because they have no knowledge of the danger . there is nothing fine in that , some are too stupid to be afraid : there is nothing fine in that . some who are not easily frightened would yet turn their backs and run , the moment they were frightened . such never had more courage than fear , but the man who will do his work in spite of his fear is a man of true courage .
the nose piece of his helmet was pushed up to allow him to speak plainly . and most plainly did he speak , i can assure you , all the way down stairs . keeping his right eye glaring upon [male] in one corner of the buttery . and at the same time petrifying [male] with his left . from father to son , the disseisins had always been famous for the manner in which they could straddle their eyes .
my landlord , the tailor , was very much rejoiced to see me . your absence , said he , has disquieted me very much . by reason you had intrusted in with the secret of your birth . and i knew not what to think , i was afraid that somebody had known you . god be thanked for your return , i thanked him for his zeal and affection .
but when the sirens saw that they were conquered , they shrieked for envy and rage . and leapt from the beach into the sea . and were changed into rocks until this day , then they came to the straits by lilybaum . and saw sicily , the three cornered island , under which [male] the giant lies groaning day and night . and when he turns the earth quakes .
the grasshopper jumped only half as high ; but he jumped right into the king 's face . which , the king said was most unpleasant , the toy goose stood still for a long time . thinking to himself ; at last the people believed he would not jump at all . `` i only hope he is not ill , '' said the house dog . when , pop , he made a side jump right into the lap of the princess .
the road even by the brook was dusty , so the cooling stream was very pleasing and grateful to their senses . on each side of them , beyond the dusty highway . stretched out broad fields of tender young corn . on the yon side of the fields uprose the sturdy oaks and beeches and ashes of the forest . while at their feet modest violets peeped out shyly and greeted the loiterers with an odor which made the heart glad .
but while they were all amusing themselves , and [male] with them . a great sledge came by ; it was painted white , and in it sat some one wrapped in a rough white fur . and wearing a white cap , the sledge drove twice round the square . and [male] fastened his own little sledge to it . so that when it went away , he followed with it .
having finished her devotions , she sent to the sultan requesting him to send her a confidential officer . who might witness the relations of five visitors whom she was going to examine . on his arrival she placed him where he could listen unseen . and covering herself with a veil , sat down on her stool to receive the pilgrims . who being admitted , bowed their foreheads to the ground ; when requesting them to arise .
and when he asked her this , she unclasped her girdle . which was fashioned after the form of a golden scaled dragon with translucent eyes . and she took the girdle and wound it nine times about her love 's arm . and she said , o love , we part . these are the years until we meet again , so she touched the golden circles on his arm .
`` hurrah , '' how little [male] would crack his whip over the five . for they were as good as his own on that one day , the sun shone brightly . and the church bells rang merrily as the people passed by , the people were dressed in their best . with their prayer books under their arms . for they were going to church to hear the clergyman preach , they looked at little [male] plowing with five horses .
but before he descended , he took two or three turns in the air over the spot . amid the acclamations of all the people ; then alighted on the spot whence he had set off . without receiving the least shock from the horse to disorder him . he dismounted , and going up to the throne , prostrated himself . and laid the branch of the palm tree at the feet of the emperor .
but all was in vain , so they laid her down upon a bier . and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days ; and then they proposed to bury her . but her cheeks were still rosy , and her face looked just as it did while she was alive . so they said , `` we will never bury her in the cold ground . '' and they made a coffin of glass so that they might still look at her .
on account of all these things , therefore , they got very angry with [female] . and went about murmuring and whispering the whole day long , and putting their heads together and plotting how best they could deprive [male] of the love of the king . one of them scattered a lot of peas on the steps up to the throne . so that [male] might stumble and break the glass sceptre which he always had to present to the king . another nailed pieces of melon skin to his shoes .
at even , when all were to go in before the king and the princess . that he who had the golden apple might show it . in they went , one after the other , but there was no one who had any apple to show . and the two brothers , as they had done on the former day . went home and told how things had gone , and how all had ridden at the hill .
the words were scarcely out of my mouth when the boat and man sank from beneath me . and left me floating on the surface , all that day and the next night i swam and floated alternately . making as well as i could for the land which was nearest to me . at last my strength began to fail , and i gave myself up for lost . when the wind suddenly rose , and a huge wave cast me on a flat shore .
it landed on a chair , the cover fell off . and then , mystery of mysteries , three quarters of the chair disappeared wholly from sight . again [male] rubbed his eyes in amazement . and slowly , like a trapper passing along a forest trail . he crept over to where the chair stood and put out his hand to feel for its missing parts .
they remained on the tree till noon . then they flew away and went towards the south . the young man 's heart beat with anxiety lest he should lose sight of his guides . but he managed to keep the birds in view until they again perched upon a tree . the young man ran after them until he was quite exhausted and out of breath .
because to get behind the button she had to lean her right elbow on his shoulder and stand a little on tiptoe . so that [male] had good cause to be frightened ; but after several stitches he realized that he was in safe hands . and drew a big breath of relief which made [female] look up rather too hastily . and down more hastily still ; so that her hand shook , and the needle slipped . and [female] said `` ow , '' and clutched the hand with the needle and held it tightly just where it was .
of how [male] , the moorish king , had once a string of pearls like those she had asked the father for . and how , after the spaniards had overcome the moors in a great battle . he intrusted these lustrous gems , with much other treasure . to one of his servants to be hidden upon a distant island , but , by some strange misfortune . as they neared the landing , the moor dropped the pearls into the sea .
after walking through the forest for a couple of miles . they all three reached the palace , and by the king 's orders servants led the charcoal burner and his wife into rooms filled with beautiful things such as they had never even dreamed of . first they bathed in green marble baths where the water looked like the sea . and then they put on silken clothes that felt soft and pleasant . when they were ready , one of the king 's special servants entered .
then a very curious scene takes place , the drones are no more use . for the queen will not fly out again , and these idle bees will never do any work in the hive . so the worker bees begin to kill them , falling upon them . and stinging them to death , and as the drones have no stings they can not defend themselves . and in a few days there is not a drone , nor even a drone egg .
at last he stood on the lofty ridge from which the road led downwards into an unknown valley and unfamiliar fields . he threw a last glance back towards his own loved mountain . then he hastened without further delay on his sorrowful journey . the golden sunlight of evening lay once more on mountain and valley . and floated on the waves of the lovely river inn .
then suddenly northwards through the surging waves came something strange . dreadful , horrible , its long outstretched serpent neck was of changing green , and its wide gaping throat was full of sharp destructive teeth . its gigantic body wound dark through the flood -- now drawn together , now stretched out in its immeasurable length . so that even the lifeless waves shrank back , and [person] 's heart almost ceased to beat with dread amazement . thus the monster of the deep rose in slow but ceaseless movements .
of his father he saw little , his mind had become impaired . and he was confined in a secluded part of the [male] . but whenever he spoke to [male] of what was nearest his heart . and his desire to enter the military school at emain [female] . she laughed , and said that he was not yet old enough to endure that rough life .
he struggled , however , against these first emotions ; but his heart was accustomed to range . and so dangerous a habit is rarely corrected , the prince 's heart was occupied all night by conflicting feelings . in the morning he waited on the king . who named the day he had fixed on for his marriage with [male] . [male] replied with an embarrassment which the king mistook for a proof of his passion .
he obeyed the old woman , threw the ball down , and followed . all the day he was going up hill and down . across valleys and open places , keeping the ball in sight and winding the thread as he went . till evening , when he saw a hill in front . and a small light at the foot of it .
to prevent too much industry in that way , [female] had induced them all to put on their skates on christmas eve . and glide over the frozen ponds , while he made ready the tree which stood in the great hall . it was an immense spruce , all powdered with silvery fringe . and [male] had only to tie on the little gilt tags numbered to correspond with the packages of gifts . which were heaped on surrounding tables , and fasten on the candles of red and blue wax .
onward the whole day they flew through the air like winged arrows . yet more slowly than usual , for they had their sister to carry , the weather grew threatening . and [female] watched the sinking sun with great anxiety . for the little rock in the ocean was not yet in sight . it seemed to her as if the swans were exerting themselves to the utmost , alas !
then the men in the coach were ordered out and compelled to disgorge their valuables . the robber seeming to identify and to pay particular attention to mr. [male] . the superintendent , who had brought with him from [location] a large sum of money . when the miners made a slight show of resistance the assailant called to his comrades in the [male] to fire upon the first man who showed fight . this threat induced a wise resignation to the inevitable .
the next day [male] the hen wife 's son stood outside the cook house and he heard a tremendous rattling within . `` that is the cook 's son preparing to go out to battle , '' said one of the grooms , `` he is striking the ladles upon the pot lids to show how fierce he is . '' just as that was being said the cook 's son walked out of the cook house . he looked around him very haughtily , then he walked away with his big sword trailing behind him and his breast plate all to one side .
they ascended it together , at the top [female] let go [female] 's hand to peep into a little room . which looked all the colours of the rainbow , just like the inside of a diamond . [female] went a step or two along a corridor . but finding she had left him , turned and looked into the chamber . he could see her nowhere , the room was full of doors .
there were two strong cords in the room , [female] made a large noose with a slip knot at the ends of both these . and , as the giants were coming through the gates , he threw the ropes over their heads . he then made the other ends fast to a beam in the ceiling . and pulled with all his might , till he had almost strangled them , when he saw that they were both black in the face . and had not the least strength left , he drew his sword and slid down the ropes .
but [person] has no such conquests , and , since the people have long ago ceased migration . there is no conquest of territory , in their interpueblo warfare loot is seldom carried away . there is practically nothing in the form of movable and easily controlled valuable possessions . such as domestic cattle , horses , or carabaos . so the usual equilibrium of [person] property distribution has little to disturb it .
when he awoke , bright day was on the mountains . the little snow wolves had slunk back to their holes and lairs . the fires burned low , and [male] lay in a sleep so quiet and profound it seemed to nod the heart beneath the sharp ribbed chest was scarcely stirring . it was bitter cold on these heights in the sunlessness of morning . and nod was glad to sit himself down beside one of the wood fires to eat his breakfast of nuts .
safie acquainted her sisters with the matter . who considered for some time what to conclude upon ; but , being naturally of a good disposition . and having granted the same favour to the three calenders , they at last consented to let them in . the [male] , his grand vizier , and the chief of the eunuchs . being introduced by the fair [male] , very courteously saluted the ladies and the calenders .
when night comes , however , then the land loses its heat very quickly . because it has not stored it up and the land air grows cold . but the sea , which has been hoarding the sun waves down in its depths . now gives them up to the atmosphere above it . and the sea air becomes warm and rises , for this reason it is now the turn of the cold air from the land to spread over the sea .
at this moment he came springing in , his sister tied the cord of rushes round his neck . led him with her own hand , and they all left the little house together . the king took the beautiful [male] on his own horse and conducted her to his castle . where the marriage was celebrated with great pomp , she was now queen . and they lived a long time very happily together ; while the roe was petted and taken care of .
she left the apartment with the storks . in order to lead them to the saloon . they went a long way through a gloomy passage . until at last a very bright light streamed upon them through a half decayed wall . when they reached this place , the owl advised them to halt very quietly .
then spring flew on with her [female] and flowers . and [female] went swiftly over hill and vale . till she came to the land where summer was dwelling . here the sun shone warmly down on the early fruit . the winds blew freshly over fields of fragrant hay .
day by day she became dearer to the prince . he loved her as one loves a good sweet child . but it never entered his head to make her his queen . yet unless she became his wife she would never win an everlasting soul . but on his wedding morning would turn to sea foam , `` am i not dearer to you than any of them ? ''
when [female] saw her , his face became as red as a drop of blood . and he could scarcely utter a word , the princess looked exactly like the beautiful lady with the golden crown . of whom he had dreamed on the night his father died . she appeared to him so lovely that he could not help loving her . then they all advised him not to attempt it .
under the largest [female] tree sat a solemn little girl in a stiff white frock . with a large red sunshade spread over her . the prince looked at her doubtfully , if she had been an ordinary little girl in a pinafore . with a laugh in her voice , he would have asked her to play with him at once . but it was impossible to be as friendly as that with a little girl in a stiff white frock .
soon after , the prince came to a gorge in the mountains . and the further he rode the narrower it became . till he could go no further , his horse could neither go forward nor turn round for him to dismount . so there he sat , jammed in , the sick king waited a long time for him . but he never came back , then the second son said , `` father , let me go and find the water of life , ''
so she was taken away to be hanged by the neck till she was dead . because she had lost her ball , presently he heard steps coming upstairs . so he hid behind the door , and was as still as a mouse . then in came a big giant five times as tall as the lad . and looked around ; but seeing nothing he went to the window and bowed himself to look out .
and the queen waved her wand again , and wind shook the trees above them . and the most luscious fruit that was ever tasted fell down into their hands ; and when the feast was over there was dancing in the glades to the music of the harps . and when they were tired dancing they set out for the boats . and the moon was rising above the trees as they sailed away over the lake . and it was not long until they reached the bank below the fairy palace .
the poor queen was , indeed , quite worn out ; she could hardly stand for fatigue . and in spite of her terror was half anxious to be persuaded , `` and there 's going to be a storm , '' added the prince ; who feared nothing now that he had the sword . `` well , this looks nice , '' said the prince , sitting down and helping himself to some delicious strawberries piled on a golden dish . and some iced lemonade , never had anything tasted so nice ; but , all the same .
the duchy of this fortunate youth had been enlarged by the late successful war . and the assembly of the states of the empire was debating whether it should not be made a kingdom . he possessed everything that it was in the power of man to desire . and yet , with each new month , he seemed to become more unhappy and dejected . when the heir to the throne drove out in his gilt coach and the duchess heard of the enthusiasm exhibited by the people .
it would be well if they were not having house cleaning at home . autumn fair time was drawing nigh , everywhere the cleaning and scouring had to be done before the fair opened . that was regarded as a great event -- more especially by the servants , it was a pleasure to go into the kitchen on market [person] and see the newly scoured floor strewn with [person] twigs . the whitewashed walls and the shining copper utensils which were suspended from the ceiling . even after the fair festivities were over there would not be much of a breathing spell .
so they ran on as fast as they could , and every waving shrub or tree their fear and the darkness changed into the form of the angry step mother . at last they came to a thick wood , and began to feel quite safe as they entered it . it seemed so large , and so far out into the wide world , that they were sure the step mother could never find them there . the gray twilight of the morning was coming on , and , as they were very tired and hungry . they sat down under the trees to eat their tortillas and strawberries .
the mother said : i am cooking wild duck eggs . i will give you one , but you must not let your sisters know . and so she gave her one . then the second daughter woke up , and asked her mother what she was cooking . she said : wild duck eggs .
the young woman rashly agreed to this , and in a short time could make clò better than any one around her . after some time , however , she began to be afraid her visitor would return . and she went about eagerly listening to hear the name , when suddenly one day she saw an opening in a grassy hillock beside her . and on looking in saw the same woman standing inside , and heard another one calling to her . she went home joyously repeating the name all the way .
the cook in the kitchen was just going to box the ears of the kitchen boy . but her hand dropped and she sank to sleep , outside the castle the wind was still . and upon the trees not a leaf stirred , in a short time there sprung up around the castle a hedge of [female] bushes . year by year the hedge grew higher and higher . until at last nothing of the castle could be seen above it .
they wound him in a rich cloth . not one , i ween , was there that wept not , [female] , the noble queen and all her women wailed bitterly for [female] . when the folk heard they sang the requiem . and that [male] was in his chest , they crowded thither . and brought offerings for his soul , amidst of his enemies .
and so he continued riding along and playing upon his fiddle for many years . until his head grew bald and his face was wrinkled and his bushy eyebrows became as white as snow . but his eyes never lost their merry twinkle . and he was just as fat and hearty as in his younger days . while , if you heard him singing his songs and scraping upon the old fiddle .
oh , cried she , you are more cruel than i had even supposed . but for you i had never known how hideous i have become , truly i am the ugliest woman in all the world ! she wept and covered her face that she might look no more in the mirror which king [male] continued to hold before her gaze . the spirit , with pitying words . led her from the castle and tried to comfort her ; but at the sight of her changed image .
while [female] had been growing up and growing old , a bountiful providence had granted a new poet to this earth . he , likewise , was a native of the valley . but had spent the greater part of his life at a distance from that romantic region . pouring out his sweet music amid the bustle and din of cities . often , however , did the mountains which had been familiar to him in his childhood .
the glamour of enchantment was naturally first attached by europeans to islands within sight of their own shores . irish , [female] , breton , or spanish , -- and then , as these islands became better known . men 's imaginations carried the mystery further out over the unknown western sea . the line of legend gradually extended itself till it formed an imaginary chart for [male] . the aged astronomer , [male] , for instance .
the bronze king , his palace . his chained lions and prancing horses had all been annihilated in one huge explosion . the terrific heat had caused such pressure within the bronze king 's body . whose blood was but fuel and whose flesh but gas . that at last it exploded with a tremendous detonation ; and the spot where he had lived in such mighty glory knew him no more .
edwy looked at it and fancied that it moved . his eye was deceived by the dancing motion of the water . while he looked and looked , some great black bird came out from the midst of it . uttering a harsh , croaking sound , the little boy could bear no more . he turned away from the terrible [male] and the terrible bird .
the day was already commencing ; the timid rabbit was lurking about the dew spangled leaves . the linnets were hopping about from branch to branch . and the wheels of some market carts were heard creaking in the distance . [male] got up , and looking at himself in the waters of a passing stream . he was surprised to see that he had a golden crown on his head .
but he had not gone far when he met on the road a fox [male] in one foot . and a cat blind in both eyes . who were going along helping each other like good companions in misfortune , the fox who was [male] walked leaning on the cat . and the cat who was blind was guided by the fox . `` good day , [male] , '' said the fox .
paul thereupon at once made up his mind to liberate the other two . and to take the girl with him , the girl handed him a golden [male] . with which he struck the castle ; and it became a golden apple . which he put in his pocket and went on , not far off in a gorgeous castle he found the second girl . whose husband and tormentor was a dragon with twelve heads .
a short time afterward three wagons laden with gold and precious stones came to the king 's palace for his youngest son . they were sent by the three kings in token of gratitude for the sword which had defeated their enemies . and the bread which had nourished their people , at this arrival the old king said to himself . `` perhaps , after all , my son was guiltless , '' and he lamented to his courtiers that he had let his son be killed . but the huntsman cried out , he lives yet , for i could not find it in my heart to fulfil your commands ', .
but one day the prince chanced to leave the door unlocked . and as he had never told her not to do so , she went in . and there she saw princess [female] lying on the silken couch . looking as if she were asleep , `` is she dead , or is she only sleeping ? '' she said to herself , and she went up to the couch and looked closely at the princess .
so the nobleman went back to his castle , and [male] lived there with him . a little room was set aside for his use in an upper story . and here they placed , by the nobleman 's orders . a small round table , and a tiny bed . no one could ever make out if he slept on this , but once when the cook entered very quickly .
he found his wife 's brother in law seated in the bar of the public house . that everlasting resort for [location] loungers . with a cigar as usual stuck in his mouth . loafing away his time as only [location] frequenters of such establishments know how to do . in [location] such a man would probably be found in such a place with a glass of some alcoholic mixture beside him .
the empress was silent , and the princes began to sing the story of their lives . `` there was once an emperor , '' they began , and a third cushion fell from under the empress . when they described the emperor 's departure to the war . three cushions fell at once , and when the princes had finished their song not a single one remained . but when they took off their caps and showed their golden hair and the golden star on their foreheads .
so of course [female] did , as soon as she had properly disposed of her [female] . she went skipping along so eagerly that she did not notice that it was an entirely different path . neither pink nor curly -- until she had gone through a new arch in the hedge and found herself in the meadow . with the equine [female] , all saddled and bridled , waiting for her , she had known from the first . just from his general expression , that the snoodle was going to lead her to something interesting .
the schools were obliged to close early ; the children came home at eleven o'clock instead of at one . and announced that they had heat holidays . for there is a regulation in [location] , if the thermometer is over a certain degree in the shade . the school is closed for the rest of the day . the high schools do not have classes in the afternoon .
so she went out and looked up to the roof , and the boy gave her a present for which she had not bargained . he threw the millstone at her . which killed her on the spot , a shepherd saved the life of the daughter of the king of snakes . the princess narrowly escaping being burnt to death , to show him her gratitude she taught him the language of animals . and he was able to understand them , one day his donkey said something that made him smile .
sementeras near some forested mountains in the [female] area are pestered with monkeys . day and night people remain on guard against them in lonely . dangerous places -- just the kind of spot the head hunter chooses wherein to surprise his enemy . all border sementeras in every group of fields are subject to the night visits of wild hogs . in some areas commanding piles of earth for outlooks are left standing when the sementeras are constructed .
so wandered he for a whole year in [male] . till at last he came upon the desert place where [female] had been banished and lived in her sorrow . as he drew near he heard a voice which he seemed to recognize . and advancing toward the sound came within sight of [male] . who recognized him at once , with tears , two of her tears fell on his eyes .
taking from the shelf a faded shawl and torn bonnet . which had been the mother 's , she fastened them on as well as she could . but they were too large ; it was all of no use . they would slip off again , as she opened the door of her chamber . a great draught of wind rushed in from the street .
it was a very bright green and gold omnibus . and inside the cushions were green and very soft , [female] and her nursemaid had it all to themselves . and [female] began to feel more comfortable , especially as she had wriggled till she had burst one of her shoulder seams and got more room for herself inside her frock . [female] said , `` so you ought to be. '' but she never said she was sorry for being cross . but you must not expect grown-up people to say that , it was certainly the wrong omnibus because instead of jolting slowly along dusty streets .
the depth beneath him seemed bottomless . only now and again his eyes distinguished shadowy forms moving about . but what they were he could not see , now he was close to the bell . and the little waves were striking it on all sides . making its tones so varied as to become a bewitching song of penetrating sweetness .
sir , while the merchant and the old man that led the bitch were talking . they saw another old man coming to them . followed by two black dogs ; after they had saluted one another , he asked them what they did in that place ? the old man with the bitch told him the adventure of the merchant and [male] . with all that had passed betwixt them , particularly the merchant 's oath .
the prince took no notice of what he said . he had turned to the princess , who was clapping her hands for joy—which was rather an unprincess like act . but she couldn t help it . and the knight was beginning to walk off as fast as he could , but a loud and commanding voice came from behind the princess . and she looked behind her suddenly , and she almost fainted .
the green spider sped down the web to the floor . and ran up the old man 's yellow silk robe . and came to a stop on his breast , beside his beard . he pulled aside a curtain in the wall . and leaving the eight men at their work , we passed .
at the end of two hours they stopped in front of a large castle . big and black and gloomy , whose doors stood wide open , although neither sound nor light gave sign of any presence within . the dog , however , seemed to know what to expect , and , after a wild howl , went on . but the boy , who was uncertain whether this was the quarter of an hour when the giant was asleep . hesitated to follow him , and paused for a moment under a wild [male] that grew near by .
it is enough , says [female] , you may retire to what place you think fit . the calender made his excuse , and begged the ladies leave to stay till he had heard the relations of his two comrades . whom i can not , says he , leave with honour . and till he might also hear those of the three other persons that were in company .
as she knelt there , with her eyes fixed on the dark water . she saw , on a sudden , a glorious shining light coming slowly toward her . and discovered , in a minute or two more , that a very large cobra was crawling up the steps from the water 's edge . having in his mouth an enormous diamond , the size and shape of an egg . that sparkled and shone like a little sun , or as if one of the stars had suddenly dropped out of heaven .
it would be hard to say which of them was the most astonished -- the rajah or the princess . she was surprised that the remedy should have taken such speedy effect . and could hardly believe her eyes when she saw her husband get up . and if he looked beautiful when dead , much more handsome did he seem to her now . so full of life and animation and power .
honey bee had no special attendants , for all the dwarf people were eager to serve her and to anticipate all her wishes except the single one to return to earth . the most erudite dwarfs , familiar with the pro foundest secrets , were glad to teach her . not from books , for dwarfs do not write , but by showing her all the plants of mountains and plains . all the diverse species of animals , and all the varied gems that are extracted from the bosom of the earth . and it was by means of such sights and marvels that they taught her .
no other voice nor sound was there , no drum . nor sentry 's pace ; the mist like banners clasped the air . as clouds with clouds embrace , but , when the old cathedral bell proclaimed the morning prayer . the white pavilions rose and fell on the alarmed air , down the broad valley fast and far the troubled army fled . up rose the glorious morning star , the ghastly host was dead .
in order , therefore , to avert the possibility of the prediction being fulfilled he swallowed her before any children were born to them . feeling afterwards violent pains in his head . he sent for [male] , and ordered him to open it with an axe . his command was obeyed , and out sprang , with a loud and martial shout . a beautiful being , clad in armour from head to foot .
but the end of these things was not yet , for now sir [male] came forth from the crowd to claim his own good steed . which , as has been told , had been stolen from him in time past by this false thief . with one hand he seized the golden bit . and with the other he drew forth his sword from its sheath . for he would have smitten the knave with a deadly blow .
the following day the miner proposed to keep watch in the castle . and said he would take good care that no one should have to go to bed fasting . so the two others went into the forest , and the miner looked after the cooking . ate his share , and put the rest by on the oven . the little grey clad man came as before , but how terrified was the miner when he perceived that this time the little man had two heads .
when she entered with the porter , the lady who had opened the gate shut it . and all three , after having passed through a splendid vestibule , entered a spacious court . encompassed with an open gallery , which had a communication with several apartments of extraordinary magnificence . at the farther end of the court there was a platform . richly furnished , with a throne of amber in the middle .
the fairy did not fear that the beauties whom he saw in the model would awake in him any emotions contrary to her wishes . they were so exceedingly small , that he could but take them for pretty little puppets . the largest figure , of a man even , not being taller than one 's [male] . his great amusement was the opera and comedy . he went to them very often : the little figures acted wonderfully well .
the elephant was pleased with that idea , too , `` good , good , '' he trumpeted . `` that is what we will do , '' so the two beasts talked together . each one praising himself and the other , and saying how great they were . the rabbit listened until he could bear it no longer . and then he stole back to the ground hog .
so all went out save king [male] and his son and a maid who was his niece . and the three knights ; and a table of silver was before them with the holy vessel . covered with a cloth of silk , three of them said they were from [male] . three from [male] , and three from denmark , upon that a voice said . `` let those among you who are not in [male] of the holy grail depart. ''
they journeyed in silence for some time . till the driver of the ox cart , who was a lazy fellow , called a halt as he himself wished to rest . and the grass was rich and green for the oxen , soon they were joined by a company of well-dressed men on horseback . who stopped in surprise on seeing such a strange sight as that of a man in a cage . the leader of the party , who made himself known to them as a canon of toledo .
she reached the boulevards , here a sea of light streamed forth from the gas flames of the lamps . the shops and the cafes , here stood in a row young and slender trees . each of which concealed its dryad , and gave shade from the artificial sunlight , the whole vast pavement was one great festive hall . where covered tables stood laden with refreshments of all kinds . from champagne and chartreuse down to coffee and beer .
but it was winter , the garden was deep in snow that was falling as if it would never stop . the peaches and plums were gone , and the lotus pond was frozen hard as stone . the little emperor had never been out in the snow before except when he was dressed in his warm padded clothes . with one gentleman in waiting carrying his porcelain stove . and another bringing tea , and a third with cakes in a box of yellow lacquer .
during the spring they would ride through the world . scattering [male] , laughter , and hope . mortals would see them , but they would not know who they were . during the summer and the autumn they would be invisible to mortals . and during the winter they would slumber in the diamond palace of his mother .
so down he sat and began to drink , but it was wonderful how much liquor it took to moisten so much dust . and each time he got to the bottom of the pot he found he was still dry . at last he began to feel very merry and pleased with himself , hi , yi ! ', said he . `` i have got a real coat o '' clay now outside and in . what a difference it do make , to be sure , i feel another man now , so smart .
as soon as this decree was made known the people flocked in crowds from all the ends of the world to try their luck . one said that it belonged to an ape , another to a lynx . a third to a crocodile , and in short some gave it to one animal and some to another . but they were all a hundred miles from the truth . and not one hit the nail on the head , at last there came to this trial an ogre who was the most ugly being in the world .
corsor , on the great belt . called , formerly , before the introduction of steam vessels , when travellers were often obliged to wait a long time for a favorable wind . `` the most tiresome of towns , '' the poet baggesen was born here . roeskilde , once the capital of denmark . the town takes its name from king [male] .
he went out , and in a little time his wife began to feel hungry . nevertheless , she knew that , in spite of what her husband had said . she ought not to eat anything while he was worshipping [female] . so she waited for a little time , but at last she got so terribly hungry that she could not wait any more . so she sat down and cooked her breakfast , and had just put one mouthful into her mouth when her husband came to the outer door .
it was a splendid day , and the roofs of the shops and houses glittered from millions of tiny points . just as you see on christmas cards . i walked on and on , feeling gladder every moment . for my fingers had left off hurting me and i knew that i could not be far from the woods . which were just outside the town , i had been there once with father .
then brother rabbit ran off in great glee , chuckling over the trick he had played on brother fox . a long time ago there was a bear that had a fine pea patch . he and his wife had to work in the field every day . so they left their little girl at home to keep house . one fine morning br'er rabbit came up to the house and called the little girl .
now during her whole life , the princess had been so carefully brought up , that she had never left the gardens of the palace . so that the sight of the hills and valleys and tinkling streams . and the song of the larks and blackbirds . made her almost beside herself with wonder and delight . she longed to get down and bathe her face in the clear pools .
all in a moment , there stood [male] , in his best clothes . on the deck of the noble ship ; and immediately the weather became fine . they sailed through the streets , round by the church . and on every side rolled the wide , great sea , they sailed till the land disappeared . and then they saw a flock of storks .
now there was a good man , a carpenter and very skilful with his tools . who so loved the oak that he gave himself . and his children after him , the name of eyck . which is pronounced ike , and is dutch for oak , when , before his neighbors and friends . according to the beautiful dutch custom , he called his youngest born child .
in the pretty little village of hayfield , not far from the borders of a thick forest . lived a good natured , idle fellow , named [male] , who supported his wife and two children by trapping or shooting in winter . and by fishing or doing odd jobs of harvest work in summer . [male] could play upon the fiddle in a way to make the tears come into your eyes . or if he chose to be merry , his tunes would set every foot in motion .
[male] now wished to tell his cousin about little [female] and her father . but a feeling of something like pride withheld him . he was afraid she might think he told her . only to lessen the crime he had committed in her eyes . he therefore remained silent on that subject ; for [female] knew well that a generous action .
also , the investigators knew that the particular form these mentally caused symptoms take depends chiefly on the kind of suggestions received from the sufferer 's environment . if he chances , for instance , to have a relative or a friend who is a paralytic . he may , in time , develop pseudosymptoms of paralysis himself . or , if his nervous equilibrium be sufficiently upset , he may develop them from merely hearing or reading about them . whatever the symptoms he manifests , his malady is curable .
the storm had abated ; of our vessel there was nothing any more to be seen . but we plainly descried , at no great distance from us . another ship , towards which the waves were driving us . as we approached , i recognised the vessel as the same which had passed by [location] in the night . and which had thrown the captain into such consternation , i felt a strange horror of this ship .
they had been so long in that situation , that one of the hens was sitting upon four eggs . and a fifth was hatching , when the shark was opened , this young bird we brought up by placing it with a litter of kittens that came into the world a few minutes before . the old cat was as fond of it as any of her own four-legged progeny . and made herself very unhappy when it flew out of her reach till it returned again . as to the other partridges , there were four hens amongst them .
[female] -- for it was he . looked with joyful surprise at the cheerful young face , and recognised at once his old playfellow . who years ago had left his native valley to push his fortune in the great world . and whose friends had long believed him to be dead , he had become a soldier . but in spite of his stern employment his heart had remained as warm and true as ever .
now a good many faggot makers passed near the place where the ogre lay . and , when they heard him groan . they went up to ask him what was the matter . but the ogre had eaten such a great number of children in his lifetime . that he had grown so very big and fat that these men could not even have carried one of his legs .
they threw into it all that they could find . old clothes , old shoes , old carpets . and everything else , [male] then took [male] by the hand and led him through the three antechambers . where she ran in a mold three bullets of gold . two bullets of silver , and one bullet of copper .
but the youth told him that she was his sister . and that he had painted her , and that if she was not prettier than the picture she was at all events not uglier . `` well , if she is as beautiful as that , i will have her for my queen , '' said the king , and he commanded the youth to go home and fetch her without a moment 's delay . and to lose no time in coming back , the youth promised to make all the haste he could .
the ceremonies observed at marriages are various , and it is not right for a man . exceeding the bounds of his condition in life . to transgress against the rules which are laid down , when the middle man has arranged the preliminaries of the marriage between the two parties . he carries the complimentary present , which is made at the time of betrothal . from the future bridegroom to his destined bride .
yet , ere he parted from his dead son , [male] stooped over him and whispered a word in his ear . and there are those who say that as the gods in infinite sorrow stood on the beach staring out to sea . darkness fell , and only a fiery track on the waves showed whither he had gone whose passing had robbed [male] and the earth of their most beautiful thing . heavy as the weight of chill death 's remorseless hand would have been their hearts . but for the knowledge of that word , they knew that with the death of [male] the twilight of the gods had begun .
then , when he rode to his house that he had bought . the shopkeeper and his wife came to him and gave him joy of his safety . whereupon he ordered them three swift thoroughbred horses and ten dromedaries and an hundred head of sheep and clad them both in sumptuous dresses of honour . then he chose out ten slave girls and ten black slaves and fifty horses and the like number of she camels and three hundred head of sheep . together with twenty ounces of musk and as many of camphor .
in the mean time the beetle , who had sailed across the ditch on a cabbage leaf . had been journeying on the other side , in the morning two persons came up to the ditch . when they saw him they took him up and turned him over and over . looking very learned all the time , especially one , who was a boy , [male] sees the black beetle in the black stone . and the black rock , is not that written in the koran ? he asked .
the princess of bengal was too reasonable not to accept the explanation offered by prince [male] schah . but she was much disturbed at his intention of departing at once , for she feared that . no sooner had he left her . than the impression she had made on him would fade away . so she made one more effort to keep him .
suddenly the princess shrieked , `` i burn , i burn , '' and death came to free her from her torments . i have no words , madam , to tell you of my feelings at this terrible sight . i would rather have remained a monkey all my life than let my benefactress perish in this shocking manner . as for the sultan , he was quite inconsolable , and his subjects . who had dearly loved the princess , shared his grief , for seven days the whole nation mourned .
whether the story is true or not i can not say , but the report went that by one blow of his fist he flattened a [male] . and kept it in his pocket in the shape of a pancake to show to all his enemies when they were about to fight him . undoubtedly he had given every giant in [male] a considerable beating . barring [male] m'coul himself . and he swore that he would never rest night or day .
aye , aye : i see that . but i will sew this , cried the tailor ; and his fingers flew with the needle . and he took such long stitches , that he was just come to the end of the trews . when it was taking up its other leg , but before it could pull it out of the pavement . the sprightly tailor had finished his task ; and , blowing out his candle .
while still in college , what seemed a chance incident gave occasion and direction to this mission . a certain english reviewer had ridiculed the work of the artist turner . now [male] held turner to be the greatest landscape painter the world had seen . and he immediately wrote a notable article in his defense . slowly this article grew into a pamphlet , and the pamphlet into a book .
the commander , not satisfied with what the jeweller had told him . came up to him and the prince of persia . and looking steadfastly at them , said , tell me truly , who is this lady ? how came you to know her ? these questions embarrassed them so much that neither of them could answer . till at length [male] extricated them from their difficulty .
she took the girls with her to the old castle . where , having cut a switch to the length represented to her in her dream . she measured the distances , and ascertained , as she supposed . the point on the floor beneath which the treasure lay . the same day she related her dream to mr. [male] .
the punishment of dirce at the hands of [female] and zethus forms the subject of the world-renowned marble group in the museum at naples . known by the name of the farnese bull , in sculpture [female] is always represented with a lyre . zethus with a club , [female] , whose affections [female] won under the form of a swan . was the daughter of [male] , king of atolia . her twin sons , [female] and [female] .
but who , after killing incessantly , is in his turn killed by his relations and friends . the moment a grey hair appears on his head . all the noble savage 's wars with his fellow savages ( and he takes no pleasure in anything else ) . are wars of extermination—which is the best thing i know of him . and the most comfortable to my mind when i look at him , he has no moral feelings of any kind .
i found myself in a dark room . which i crossed quickly to a door at the other side , this door i opened on a crack . and through the crack i looked into a lighted room . a small room , evidently a workshop , cluttered about with glass vessels of strange shapes . metal machines of various sorts , wooden hoops curiously interlaced .
but a still better thing was that she soon grew very fond of prince . towards the gaining of her affections , he had three advantages . first , his nature was inferior to hers ; next , he was a beast . and last , she was afraid of him ; for so spoiled was she that she could more easily love what was below than what was above her . and a beast , than one of her own kind , and indeed could hardly have ever come to love any thing much that she had not first learned to fear .
now they entered the cavern , oh , how icily cold it was . but it did not last long , the eastwind spread his wings . and they shone like the brightest flame ; but what a cave it was ! large blocks of stone , from which the water dripped . hung over them in the most extraordinary shapes .
although they discountenanced her frequent visits to the place . they were not able to restrain them , for she was of so [female] and delicate a temper that they feared to thwart her . her attachment to the fairy wood . therefore , grew with her years , if she wished to solicit her spirits to procure pleasant dreams . or any other [female] favor , [female] repaired to the manitowok .
as the crowd of visitors increased unceasingly , and the inhabitants of the large cities of [location] began to come . some man , greedy of gain . built a caravanserai to lodge the guests and their servants . camels , and mules , soon there was , in front of the column . a market to which the fishermen of the nile brought their fish .
presently he came to a farmhouse , where he inquired if they were in need of a bailiff . now , the farmer just happened to need a head man . so he was engaged at once upon the same terms as he had arranged with the old blacksmith . next morning the farm servants were to go and fell trees in the wood . but just as they were ready to start they found the new bailiff was still in bed and fast asleep .
dear , dear , here we are at the end of the book and poor little [male] . junior , has not yet found his father , maybe he will in the next book . to know [male] junior once is to love him forever , that 's the way all the little people feel about this young . adventurous cat , son of a very famous father . a new and unique series about the furred and feathered little people of the wood and meadow .
however , the wizard kept on offering her more and more for it , until at last the gold ring grew frightened . and changed itself into a grain of barley . which fell on the ground , the man then turned into a hen . and began to search for the grain of barley , but this again changed itself to a pole cat . and took off the hen 's head with a single snap .
at this the rajah commanded that they should be fetched down , and when he saw [male] bai he felt very sad to think that she was dead . and he took her hand to feel if it were already stiff . but all her limbs were supple , nor had she become cold , as the dead are cold . and , looking again at her hand , the rajah saw that a sharp thing . like a long [female] , had run into the tender palm .
he had a great mass of brown curly hair tumbling about his head . green ears -- it seemed to her , could it be possible ? no , it must be that he had stuck oak leaves into his curly locks for ornament . pretty oak leaves tinged with soft red , moreover he had the bluest and strangest eyes she had ever seen . they shone like wonderful jewels at one moment .
the old man , perceiving the effect which this liquor had upon me . and that i carried him with more ease than before , made me a sign to give him some of it . i handed him the calebash , and the liquor pleasing his palate . he drank it all off , there being a considerable quantity of it . he became drunk immediately , and the fumes getting up into his head .
quack , quack as they strutted about on the green banks of the pond . but their mother used to warn them not to stray too far , telling them that a wicked witch lived in the castle beyond the garden , adding , she has ruined me , and she will do her best to ruin you. but the young ones did not listen to their mother , and playing about the garden one day . they strayed close up to the castle windows , the witch at once recognised them by their smell .
now she goes from the mansion to a little peasant hut in the field . therein lives a poor paralysed girl ; the window of her little room looks northward . the sun does not enter here , the girl can only see a small piece of field which is surrounded by a high fence . but today the sun shines here . the warm , beautiful sun of god is within the little room .
next spring the fox asked the bear if he did not think turnips would be the right thing for that year . when the autumn came the fox took the turnips . but the bear only got the tops , the bear then became so angry that he parted company then and there with [male] . one day the bear was lying eating a horse which he had killed . [male] was about again and came slinking along , his mouth watering for a tasty bit of the horseflesh .
as it was a self fastening window , the bird was unable to get out . and sat there [male] whilst the man servant belonging to the house entered the room . looking round , he presently perceived some gravy spilt on the clean table cloth . and another glance satisfied him that the silver gravy spoon was missing . as he knew he should be held responsible for the loss .
but once more the prince slept through it all , and when morning had come the golden bird was forced to fly away . now it chanced that that night some of the folk of the king 's household heard the bird singing . and they told the prince all about it . so when the third night came , and the false princess gave the prince the cup of wine with the sleeping powder in it . he threw the wine over his shoulder .
the queen hugged her magic crystal for a whole week . but could make nothing out of it : for her crystal showed her nothing of the king 's son 's hiding place . nor of the fox at his nightly thefts of butter and eggs from the royal dairy . but it so happened that this same fox was a sort of half-brother of the queen 's . and so guilty did he feel with his brand-new good conscience that he quite left off going to see her .
the old man was not sufficiently cunning , and did as he was told ; he lay down and looked steadily along the log . when the soldier saw the old man 's beard had got well into the cleft . he struck out the wedge ; the cleft closed and the old man was caught by the beard . the soldier began to beat him with the axe handle . and then swung the axe round his head , and vowed that he would split his skull if he did not tell him .
but he was too kind heart ed to keep everything for himself . he gave nice presents to the cap tain and the sailors . and to the servants in mr. fitz warren 's house . he even remembered the cross old cook . after that , [male] 's face was washed , and his hair curled .
the winter was very hard ; the ponds were covered with ice . and there was very little food for either the beasts of the field or the birds of the air . our little bird flew away into the public roads , and found here and there . in the ruts of the sledges , a grain of corn . and at the halting places some crumbs , of these he ate only a few .
he felt within himself that could he but reproduce these enchanting forms in marble . he would die content , he resolved to seek his home . and return thence provided with all the necessary materials for working , he had noticed during his wanderings . not far from this very spot , a cave , where he fancied he could work undisturbed . the clay by this river being famous for its plastic properties .
the others all applauded this speech , and , having with one accord hardened their hearts . waited for their opportunity , now it so happened that , on the 20th day of the 12th month . the then shogun , prince [male] . was pleased to worship at the tombs of his ancestors at uyéno ; and [male] and the other elders . hearing this , looked upon it as a special favour from the gods .
in answer to this the chief himself climbed up and swung the tree over roots first . while he held and steadied it by its topmost branches . at this moment the prince , unseen by the others . drew his sword , and , with one stroke , hewed off the giant 's head . it fell within the city walls .
`` he will do it easily , '' said the ranee . who was very proud of her son , so that night the prince walked about the palace garden for a long time . but at last he was so sleepy that he lay down near the bathing place and did not awake until the sun was just rising . leaning against the steps of the marble tank was a lovely girl dressed in blue silk with a chain of pearls around her neck and red lotus flowers in her hair . the prince jumped up quickly , exclaiming , `` you can not be the thief ! ''
how different the picture in her mind , from [male] . as he sat observing her , she had spoken of his free step . she was right in that , for years and years . he never once had crossed that threshold at his own slow pace . but with a footfall counterfeited for her ear ; and never had he .
then he left her , a gleaming whiteness at the foot of the great fire oak . and went his way as the fairy had directed him . it was not long until he arrived at the house of the wise one . a [male] little scarlet hut . it was , set in the midst of a thicket of flaming bushes .
there was still another curious bond between the three -- which in most cases would have been the very reverse of a bond . and pretty certainly would have dissolved the friendship , they were all in love with the same girl . a charming girl she was , but of her . more shall be told hereafter , perhaps the hopelessness of their admiration for her helped to keep the peace . for they were far too poor to aspire to her , as she was a damsel with a dowry of gold and silver .
when [male] saw this he was so pleased that he let out a whoop of joy . `` wait a bit , for the story is not yet half told , '' said the little man in green , he then drew out a mouse dressed as a gentleman of quality . and a bumblebee in a flowered silk skirt and overdress . the cockchafer began to play a tune , the mouse bowed to the bumblebee .

first , however , the landlord stopped to wash in the kitchen , he picked up the towel to dry his face . and the pin that was in it scratched him from ear to ear . he went to the hearth to light his pipe and the egg shells flew up in his face . he sat down in his chair for a moment . but scarcely had he leaned back , when he jumped up with a cry .
the tribes resulting from the segregation effected by the manu for the formation of the new root race eventually found their way to the southern shores of [location] . and there the first great aryan kingdom was established , when the transaction dealing with the origin of a root race comes to be written . it will be seen that many of the peoples we are accustomed to call semitic are really aryan in blood . the world will also be enlightened as to what constitutes the claim of the hebrews to be considered a `` chosen people .

as for subplot number one : [male] properly omitted it from his television presentation . it is a third variation on the theme of a woman torn between a dashing scoundrel and a boring steady gentleman . in this one , as it turns out , aunt greenow selects the impecunious captain bellfield . and we leave her beginning to get him housebroken . [male] 's great achievement in this novel is the creation of [male] and plantagenet .
if , however , as was more probable ( and as was generally believed to be the case when the matter was considered afterwards ) . the three crones had been well aware of the projected attack upon them . and had purposely left home -- hoping that they might lie safely hid in the abode of so honest and quiet a man as [male] until the danger was over . then it became a serious question as to what other refuge they would seek . now that they had been so manfully driven from their intended place of safety .
pepe kept his own counsel and confided to no one save old [male] what he knew . she , too , had learned to be discreet and consequently did not repeat his confidences even to the duchess . who had enough to bear without that additional burden , how pale her darling seemed to her when she saw him in the glass ! yet , even on the worst days , he was busy at his place in the piazza . where the cathedral , which he had been building for three years .

the night grew on , changing at every moment , for change is the law . there were small frowns of clouds which were replaced by smiles of light . did never you hear the laughter of the night ? it is a strange thing , not all men have heard it . the singing mouse told me of this .
he first threw some water on his wife 's face . and , as soon as she came to herself , he said to her : bring me quickly my seven league boots . that i may go and catch the little vipers , the ogre found himself quite weary with the journey he had gone . for seven league boots are very tiresome to the person who wears them . so he now began to think of resting , and happened to sit down on the very rock where the poor children were hid .
as she stood there with the cap still upon her head . the mirror door was burst open and the dwarf rushed into the room . his dress was disordered and his eyes glared wildly , he looked hastily about him . but he could see neither the cap nor the princess . at once he knew that she had found the cap and had put it on .
`` do you see that birds '' nest in the top of that tree ? in it are six eggs ; you must climb up there and get all those eggs for me before nightfall . and if one is broken woe betide you , at that prince [male] did not feel so happy . for there were no branches to the tree till very near the top . and it was as smooth , as smooth as it could be , and he did not see how possibly he could reach the birds ', nest .
then they all dismounted and with the pages and the ladies and the gentlemen in armor the scene was as gay as the stage of an opera . everybody chatted and laughed , and some of the court ladies stroked [female] 's fur with their pretty white hands . and one took off her bracelet and hung it about his neck . but when the princess [female] went forward to ask her question . everyone fell back , then with sweet dignity , as became a princess .
when he came to the middle of the lake he stayed breathing full breaths . till the air deepened with fragrance around him . presently underneath him he felt the movement of a great thing coming up from the bottom of the pool . it touched his feet and came grazing along his side . and all at once shuddering and horror took hold upon him , for his whole nature was filled with loathing of its touch .
he led him to the king 's cellar . and the man set to upon the great casks , and he drank and drank till his sides ached . and by the end of the day the cellar was empty . then again simpleton demanded his bride , but the king was annoyed that a wretched fellow called `` simpleton '' should have his daughter . and he made new conditions , he was now to find a man who could eat up a mountain of bread .
who , to put the more honour on the sultan 's minister . appeared in magnificent apparel , the king of tartary received the embassador with the greatest demonstrations of joy . and immediately asked him concerning the welfare of the sultan , his brother . the vizier , having acquainted him that he was in health . gave him an account of his embassy .
[female] went back to his work , hoping that in season his labor would yield a good crop . he had his widowed mother to support and must needs [male] every day . his one delight was to come home , weary after the long hours of labour in the muddy rice field . and have a hot bath , this his mother always had ready for him . then , clean and with a fresh kimono , and a little rest before supper time .
so [female] went once more to the town and did exactly as the serpent had told him . not knowing anything of magic , he did not in the least expect anything to happen . so you may imagine his surprise when not only the fruit . but every tree and leaf and bough in the whole orchard . turned into solid gold , and glittered so in the sunlight that one could scarcely bear to look at them .
more than twenty years ago , began the castellan , at a sign from the chaplain -- more than twenty years ago i was a bold shepherd . driving my flock up the mountains , a young knight followed me . whom they called [male] the slender . he wanted to buy of me my favourite little lamb for his fair bride .
perhaps they would like to have it opened , yes , that they would . so [male] opened the bottle , hui ! what a hubbub there was ! the king hopped about till his slippers flew off , his dressing gown fluttered like great wings . and his crown rolled off from his head and across the floor . like a quoit at the fair , as for the princess .
in a forsaken stone building , which stood just beyond the seas of snow . they one night took shelter . here they found some [female] and pine branches . so that they soon made a fire , they arranged couches to lie on as well as they could . and then the men seated themselves by the fire .
so that was an end of her , and after that the little boy was ever so much happier . and all the summer time he sate with his little rose coloured shoes under the wild rose tree and listened to [organization] song . but when winter came and the wild rose tree was all barren and bare save for [male] flowers . the white bird came no longer and the little boy grew tired of waiting for it . so one day he gave up altogether , and they buried him under the rose tree beside his little playmate .
`` dear me , what have they been erecting here ? '' he cried . as he caught sight of the east gate . which in olden times used to stand at the end of east street . however , he found an opening through which he passed . and came out upon where he expected to find the new market , nothing was to be seen but an open meadow .
he is said to have appeared in [location] , but the date is not given . he was noticed in church , listening to the sermon . after the service he was questioned , and he related his story . on this occasion he received presents from the burgers . in 1633 he was again in [location] , in the year 1640 .
with her left hand she leaned on a crooked stick . and with her right hand she held , by a leather thong . the biggest and fiercest looking dog i had ever seen in my life . his head came nearly to the old woman 's shoulder . he was chocolate brown in color .
the fact , as i say , was , she would had too many . she could not sleep , and she called it virtue . motherly foresight , affection , any name you may call it that will not hurt you . so it was late ere she tucked her head in . and she slept so late it was almost a sin .
the [male] smiled and made him a handsome present . and he went away rejoicing , they run her down to me . and yet no fault in her find i . except perhaps it be a speck she hath in either eye . to compensate this fault , if fault it be , o
the baron continued to talk , now and then almost falling in the snow , but not permitting such slight mishaps to interrupt his discourse . which was addressed to nobody and had a general nature , touching upon dragons . marriages , crusades , and burgundy . could he have seen [male] 's more and more woe begone and distracted expression . he would have concluded his future son in law was suffering from some sudden and momentous bodily ill .
but although the old woman pretended to be friendly , she was a wicked witch . who had her house built of gingerbread on purpose to entrap children . when once they were in her power , she would feed them well till they got fat . and then kill them and cook them for her dinner . and this she called her feast day .
to make home truly happy , the mind must be cultivated. it is all very well to say that a man and his wife . and their children , if they have any , ought to be company enough for each other . without seeking society elsewhere ; and it is quite right that it should be so . but what if they have nothing to say to each other , as reasonable and thinking beings ? nothing to communicate beyond the veriest common places -- nothing to learn from each other ?
ak is the master woodsman of the world . he sees everything , and knows more than the sons of men . that night he held the queen 's hand . for he loved the nymphs as a father loves his children . and [male] lay at his feet with many of her sisters and earnestly harkened as he spoke .
now they began to have lattices , and , much later , even glass windows . they removed the fireplace from the middle of the floor and set it at the end of the house . opposite the door , and built chimneys , then they set the beds at the side . and made sleeping rooms , this was done by stretching curtains between partitions . they had also a loft , in which to keep odds and ends .
the stranger was dressed in green , and wore a cap bearing the appearance of the king 's [male] of a sheep . the housewife said the family were at the shielings with the cattle . and there was no food in the house ; there was not even a drink of milk . the visitor then asked to be allowed to make brose of the dye . and received permission to do what she liked with it .
as the sun poured its last rays over them there at the foot of the oak . it was to be seen that they were very poor , their clothes were old and weather stained . and they had no shoes to their feet . but the white feet of the girl shone like ivory flowers in the grass . and her hair was a sheaf of ruddy gold .
with one exception only , [female] had the hearty praises of all the people . now it happened that there lived in this same village an envious and boastful fellow . who had been once a chief , always coming home badly whipped , he had been put out of office . and now spent his time about the place , proclaiming certain great things which he had in his eye and which he meant to do . one of these days , this man 's name was [male] , the owl .
how was it then that he played such merry tunes ? so merry indeed that , listening to them , [male] quite forgot to be [male] and sad . the old man went on playing and [male] went on listening . after a while , the little boy smiled , then he laughed . the old man lifted his head , he could not see with his sightless eyes .
but liberty is so sweet that [male] did not mind his hard fare . and he went on his way to rome repeating penitential prayers . while his hair and beard grew until his head and face were nearly hidden . arrived at rome , the people wondered much to see such a strange-looking being ; but when he opened his mouth to inquire his way topeter 's . so strong was the smell of onions and garlic that the people .
so autumn came , and all the hill sides were golden with the heather ; and the red [female] berries of the [female] trees hung from the boughs . and were wet with the spray of the waterfalls in the burns . and days grew shorter , and winter came with snow . but [female] never came back to [female] , season after season passed . and year after year , lady [female] 's hair grew white like snow .
then it was suddenly light up among the trees , and she fancied it must be the moon . for there was a face ; but it was the old soldier with the red beard . he sate there , nodded his head , and said , `` look , what beautiful dancing shoes ! '' then she was terrified , and wanted to fling off the red shoes , but they clung fast . and she pulled down her stockings , but the shoes seemed to have grown to her feet .
great was the mourning of the barons and the people of cornwall when it was known how deep and wide was the wound which [male] had received from the lance of sir [male] . many famous leeches came and searched the wound and strove to close it . but none availed , when two months had passed , came an old , old woman . a witch wise in leechcraft beyond all others . who was called the mother of the mists , and who lived in the great shuddering moor .
that having once passed , he would soon have him in command of a fine frigate . with a good nursing first lieutenant ; and that if he did not behave himself properly . he would make his signal to come on board of the flag ship . take him into the cabin , and give him a sound horsewhipping . as other admirals have been known to inflict upon their own sons under similar circumstances .
they travelled all day , only stopping now and then to rest , and already the queen began to be better and to take a little interest in the things she saw . just as the evening was coming on they entered the forest , here it was quite dark . for the trees grew so close together that the sun could not shine through them . and very soon they lost the path , and wandered helplessly about wondering what they should do . `` if we sleep in this dreadful place , '' said the queen .
he passed off many happy days in the forest . but one day he and poor [male] were strolling through the trees . when they came to the very spot where they first met . and , accidentally looking up , he could see his watch hanging in the tree which he had to climb when he first saw poor [male] coming to him in the form of a bear . and he cries out , [male] , [male] , i can see my watch up in that tree .
at last the turn came for that brother who knew the dictionary by heart . but he did not know it now ; he had absolutely forgotten it altogether . and the boards seemed to re echo with his footsteps , and the ceiling of the hall was made of looking glass . so that he saw himself standing on his head . and at the window stood three clerks and a head clerk .
a large hedge of thorns soon grew around the palace . and every year it became higher and thicker . till at last the whole place was surrounded and hidden , so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen . but there went a report , through all the land , of the beautiful sleeping [male] rose ( for so was the king 's daughter called ) . so that from time to time several kings
nanna left her indignant little [female] , and went to cook a nice bowl of soup for [female] . while [female] concocted a fine plan , and , what was more remarkable , carried it out . for a week it rained , for a week [female] lay in pain . and for a week [female] worked quietly at her little easel in the corner of the studio . while her father put the last touches to his fine picture .
so when the man 's daughter was just setting off , the old witch shot a red hot bar of iron after her . but she sprang behind the door and hid herself . so that it missed her , for her friends . the little birds , had told her beforehand how to behave , then she walked on and on as fast as ever she could . but when she got to the apple tree .
before morning she had made the entire circuit of the lake . muttering fearful words as she crossed every stream . and casting into it some of the water out of her bottle . when she had finished the circuit she muttered yet again . and flung a handful of water towards the moon .
and so repentant was she that she almost forgot to think of herself . never had she been so sweet and loving a wife , she did everything she possibly could to please and cheer the king . concealing from him the many bitter tears she shed as she sat for hours together beside the sleeping child . the winter was terribly severe -- never had the snow lain more thickly , never had the wind blasts raged and howled more furiously . often did the queen think to herself that the storm spirits must be infuriated at her very presence in their special domain .
`` take some , '' said the ox , and the bear fell upon him and began to tear away at the tar . he tore and tore , and buried his teeth in it till he found he could not let go again . he tugged and he tugged , but it was no good . and the ox dragged him gradually off , goodness knows where . then the old woman awoke , and there was no ox to be seen , alas !
she then gave her the same directions she had formerly given rosamond—with this difference . that she told her to go into the picture hall when she pleased . showing her the entrance , against which the clock no longer stood—and went away , closing the door behind her . as soon as she was left alone , [female] set to work tidying and dusting the cottage . made up the fire , watered the bed , and cleaned the inside of the windows .
the king was so carried away by the glamor of the white hind 's magical beauty that he went home at once . had the eyes of his seven queens taken out , and , after throwing the poor blind creatures into a noisome dungeon whence they could not escape . set off once more for the hovel in the ravine , bearing with him his horrible offering . but the white hind only laughed cruelly when she saw the fourteen eyes . and threading them as a necklace , flung it round her mother 's neck .
when the youth entered he found many splendid chambers . each one finer than the last , hundreds of tapers burnt upon golden candlesticks . and shed a light like the brightest day , at length they reached a chamber where a table was spread with the most costly dishes . at the table were placed two chairs , one of silver . the other of gold , the [female] seated herself upon the golden chair .
dancing lost much of its simplicity and harmlessness when masquerades were introduced . these being the first examples of the ballet , these masquerades . which soon after their introduction became passionately indulged in at court under [female] . were , at first , only allowed during carnival , and on particular occasions called charivaris . and they were usually made the pretext for the practice of the most licentious follies .
then boots mounted on the new [female] 's back and rode back toward the castle . and the old [male] trotted along beside him , safely they passed through the forest and crossed the plain . and as they neared the castle they saw that the king and all his court had come out to meet them . for they had heard the news of their coming . boots lighted down from the new [male] and led both horses to the king .
she was as submissive and obedient as if he had been the king . he found the bed clothes tossed about , and most of them on the floor . while the princess 's garments were scattered all over the room . which was in the greatest confusion , it was only too evident that the goblins had been there . and [female] had no longer any doubt that she had been carried off at the very first of the inroad .
the bee man hesitated a moment , and then he walked toward the woman . hearing him coming , she raised her head . and when she saw the child she rushed towards it . snatched it into her arms . and screaming with joy she covered it with kisses .
as he said this he held up the comb under the bear 's nose . took off the leaf , jumped up on a stone , and began to gibber and laugh . for there was neither honey nor honeycomb , but a [male] 's nest . as big as a man 's head , full of wasps . and out swarmed the wasps and settled on [male] 's head .
so [male] held back his anger , and he threw the potatoes in gently . [location] , [location] , [location] . but when the potato wife had gone on her way . he flew off to his brown house by the brown bramble ; and he began to weave a spell . he put into it a potato . and a grain of earth , and a down from a pillow .
the prince stopped to pick it up , and this gave [female] time to escape . but she was only just in time , just as she was crossing the palace yard . the clock finished striking , and immediately all her finery vanished . and there she was , dressed in her old ragged frock again , when the prince came out upon the palace steps . he could see no sign of the lovely princess .
but the old man 's child was beautiful , industrious , obedient and good , god had gifted her with every virtuous and lovable quality . yet she was persecuted by her spiteful sister , as well as by her step mother . it was fortunate that she possessed endurance and [female] . or she would have fared badly , whenever there was any hard work to be done . it was put upon the old man 's daughter .
suddenly i perceived , rearing itself among the leaves , the hideous head of a gigantic snake . in another instant , whether to re arrange its position or for what other reason i know not . the reptile dropped down from the branch to the length of some three or four feet . and swing for a moment or two like the pendulum of a clock . from the branch around which its tail and part of its body remained curled .
already had he grown high above the clouds , which floated past beneath his crown like dark troops of passage birds . or like great white swans , and every leaf of the tree had the gift of sight . as if it had eyes wherewith to see . the stars became visible in broad daylight , great and sparkling ; each of them sparkled like a pair of eyes . mild and clear , they recalled to his memory well-known [male] eyes .
baron munchausen , [female] 's travels , and all those other histories , upon the veracious nature of which no sensible person has ever entertained a doubt . so you will see at once that i can not , as a fair and true historian . invent anything , even for the purpose of pleasing my beloved readers . but must go on perforce and relate the facts as they really occurred .
in spite of the veil which floated around the stately figure of the grieving mother . she could see her bosom rise and fall with her sobs of [female] . [female] 's compassionate heart made it impossible for her to watch this sorrow longer . and , covering her face with her hands , she turned her back upon the procession and . weeping aloud , limped away as fast as her injured foot would let her .
rosamond then understood that the mere calling herself a princess . without having any thing to show for it , was of no use . she obeyed and rose , for she was hungry ; but she had to [female] the floor ere she had any thing to eat . not content with being set down and let alone , she continued to storm and scold at the shepherd . crying she was a princess , and would like to know what right he had to touch her !
this advice pleased the king , and he asked [male] how much money he would take instead of the wife who had been promised him . then [male] , after consulting with the others , answered , `` i will take as much gold and silver as one of my comrades can carry on his back . '' the king consented ; whereupon they brought [male] . on whom they began to load bales of ducats . sacks of patacas , large purses full of crowns .
in mr. [male] 's larger work on furniture and woodwork . which includes a catalogue of the different examples in the south kensington museum . there is a list of the various artists and craftsmen who have been identified with the production of artistic furniture either as designers or manufacturers . and the writer has found this of considerable service , in the appendix to this work . this list has been reproduced , with the addition of several names omitted by mr. [male] .
the dismal [female] , who loved to take the darkest view of things . told [female] that she had better come with her to the cavern . and spend the rest of her life in being miserable , [female] answered that [female] was welcome to go back thither herself . but that , for her part , she would wander about the earth in [male] of the entrance to king [female] 's dominions . and [female] took her at her word , and hurried back to her beloved cave .
so he sent [male] down to hades . the dark and stern king , to bid him send [male] to see her mother [female] . but before hades let her go , he gave her a pomegranate to eat . because he did not wish her to stay away from him always . and he knew that she must come back if she tasted but one of the pomegranate seeds .
consequently there came a present of a bit of gingerbread every now and then , and of course [female] received her share of the gift . but , perhaps the most charming thing of all was that the gingerbread dealer knew all sorts of tales . and could even relate histories about his own gingerbread cakes . and one evening , in particular , he told a story about them which made such a deep impression on the children that they never forgot it . and for that reason it is perhaps advisable that we should hear it too .
or rather , it was two separate roarings , as you may sometimes hear two separate storms thundering at once over two ranges of hills . and in astonishment he went first to beddingham , and there , bound by an iron chain to a stake beside a pond . he found a mighty lion , as white as a young lamb . but he had not a lamb 's meekness . for he ramped and raved in a great circle around the stake .
[female] said never a word until they had gotten out of the town . there his anger boiled over , like water into the fire . `` look , '' said he to [male] . `` born a fool , live a fool , die a fool . '' i want no more of you , here are two roads .
with a gush of pride at his skill . and pleasure at his success , he ran to pick up his prey . i must say for him he picked it up gently . perhaps it was the beginning of his repentance . but when he had the white thing in his hands its whiteness stained with another red than that of the sunset flood in which it had been revelling , ah god !
the old people were very active and industrious , they were never idle for even a single hour . on sunday afternoons they would bring out some books . generally a book of travels which they were very fond of . the old man would read aloud about africa , with its great forests and the wild elephants . while his wife would listen attentively , stealing a glance now and then at the clay elephants .
longthorn , who learned each evening from the officers of the household . when they came to bring the princess her supper . how far they were on their journey , at last persuaded her mother . who put off the cruel act as long as she could . that it would never do to wait any longer , they were nearly at the capital .
the fiddler gives the word & the staff falls to drubbing the dwarf as he deserves , pop ! —up jumps his staff from the corner where he had stood it . and then you should have seen the dust fly ! this time it was the manikin who hopped over the chairs and begged and bawled for [male] . as for the fiddler , he stood by with his hands in his pockets and whistled .
and when the sun melted the ice bound surface of the waters . and the swans swam once more in the sea of moyle . the salt water entered their wounds . and they well nigh died of pain . but in time the down on their breasts and the feathers on their wings grew .
[female] was not likely to forget the feast of lanterns . for the children had talked of nothing else for a month . and he promised to come home as early as he could . at noontide , when his fellow labourers gave up working , and sat down to rest and eat . [male] took his axe and went up the mountain slope to find a small tree he might cut down for fuel .
kristopo gave no direct answer to the fairy 's envoys . but kept [female] closely guarded in a tower , where the poor girl used all her powers of persuasion to induce him to put off their marriage . all would , however , have been quite vain if , in the course of a few days . sorrow , joined to the spell of the magic water . had not altered her appearance so completely that [female] was quite alarmed , and declared that she needed amusement and fresh air .
then the master was just going to fly into a rage , when [male] said to him . `` keep cool , master , keep cool , '' and pointed to his back , so next day the master had sent [male] out with the sheep . but so that he should not sell any of them to get money for his lunch he sent his wife with them telling her to watch [female] from behind a [male] . and if he tried to sell any of the sheep to stop him .
there he stood on the old landing , with the autumn wind blowing down upon him through the trap door . it was very cold ; but the little creature did not really feel it . till the light in the garret went out , and the tones of music died away . then how he shivered , and crept down stairs again to his warm corner , where it felt home-like and comfortable . and when christmas came again , and brought the dish of jam and the great lump of butter .
when the affairs of wynn castle were all arranged , [male] resolved to seek his fortune in the wide wide world . his aunt and sister did their best to dissuade him from leaving home . but he turned a deaf ear to their arguments and entreaties . at last they reluctantly acquiesced , and it was finally arranged that his aunt and sister were to remain at the villa ( this house and grounds forming no part of the wynn castle estate ) . the former promising to supply as far as she was able the void which death had created .
he did not have to say any more , [male] was already far away on his way to the wild geese . once again [female] and her flock had to take a night fly . fortunately , the moon had not gone down ; and with the aid of its light . she succeeded in finding another of those sleeping places which she knew in that neighbourhood . again she followed the shining river toward the south .
`` you are a good for nothing , '' her mother would cry angrily ; but this was not true . for [female] could spin , one feast day . while her mother went to the fair , she was told to watch the pentola . and to stir it carefully if it boiled too fast , it was made of rice and good fresh meat . with vegetables from the little garden ; and it smelt so delicious that [female] 's small nostrils quivered like the petals of a rose on a windy day .
so [female] rolled nuts to the fairy baby . and rolled nuts till the baby toddled after the nuts and let fall the [location] . and [female] took it up and put it in her apron . and at [female] they rode home as before . and the moment [female] got home to her room she rushed and touched [female] three times with the [location] .
naturally , as farmer [female] observed , no witch could stand against that . and [male] was a lucky man to possess it . it was doubtless in consequence . and by virtue of this relic , that as soon as the good man was well inside the cottage . he not only smelt the sulphur which had not been smelt by the family .
prince [male] forthwith proceeded to saddle his horse with a tcherkess saddle . put a silken bridle into his mouth . and leading him out , mounted , and rode into the open fields , but as soon as he applied the spur . the horse grew restive , reared higher than the waving forests . plunged lower than the flying clouds ; mountains and rivers he left behind .

i did not stay much longer in the wunderberg , for somehow the scented air seemed to have grown chilly . when i said to snow blossom that i must leave her . she wept again , and gave me a shining strand of hair to guide me back to the moor . it turned into gossamer when i reached the daylight . and floated softly away , if you have ever tried to count the raindrops , you will know how i felt when for three whole days it poured in torrents .
i am so hungry , and no one will ever miss them , then the two ate the pieces . but the woman came into the kitchen and saw that they were eating something and said . what have ye been eating ? two little morsels which fell out of the bird , ', answered they . `` that must have been the heart and the liver , '' said the woman . quite frightened , and in order that her husband might not miss them and be angry .
the king of the country of the red camellias was delighted to recover his long lost son . and showed his sense of what was right and proper under the circumstances by dying shortly after the wedding of [male] and [male] had been duly celebrated . the young prince consequently conveyed his lovely and loving bride to his own country . where they reigned for many years in great happiness and prosperity . [male] and [male] , having a mother 's influence to guide them .
the next night the stepsisters dressed again , and drove away to the ball . and more than ever did [female] long to go with them . scarcely had they gone , however , when the fairy godmother appeared in the kitchen . the godmother bade [female] bring her the pumpkin . the mice , the rat , and the lizards .
`` good by , '' shouted [female] , [female] , and [female] . all in one breath , but , together with her enjoyment of the sport . there was still a little remnant of fear in the child 's heart . so that her last look at the three boys was a troubled one , and made them feel as if their dear sister were really leaving them forever . and what do you think the snowy bull did next ? why , he set off .
little [female] has lost her sheep . and can not tell where to find them , let them alone and they will come home . and bring their tails behind them , and c . needles and pins , needles and pins . when a man marries his trouble begins , once i saw a little bird .
presently [person] and [person] were tucked into the hay . and old [person] climbed in with the plaited reins , and away they went along the narrow forest track . where the wheels followed the ruts and splashed through the deep holes . for the spring was young , and the roads had not yet dried , some of the deepest holes had a few pine branches laid in them . but that was the only road mending that ever was done , overhead were the tall firs and silver birches with their little pale round leaves .
one day he was standing by a bed of large white bell lilies . their great bowls were full of water , and inside among the yellow stamens gold fish went darting to and fro . while he watched he saw , mirrored in the water . the breast of a green bird flying towards the trees of the garden . it had come from a far country surely , for its shape and colour were strange to him .
gueridons , i.e. , stands to place lights or [location] upon . the word is now used to signify any small round table with one foot . but the old-fashioned stand , which was higher than a table , and its top not bigger than a dessert plate . is occasionally to be met with , looking glasses with frames of the same material were much in vogue at that period . of silver framed mirrors some magnificent specimens remain to [location] at [location] , [person] .
the prince scampered across the room , and threw his arms around the beautiful creature 's neck . all its bells jangled as the head swayed gracefully down ; and the prince kissed it between the eyes . great eyes they were , the colour of fire . so wonderfully bright , it seemed they must be really alive , only they did not move . but gazed continually with a set stare at the tapestry hung wall .
ever after that they all three came together as i have told you . and waited at a little distance till their uncle made his appearance . for [male] confided to his cousins that there had been something uncanny about the mysterious sounds . furthermore he felt instinctively that he had not been meant to overhear them . and that if [male] knew of it he might have been angry .
when the man came back he found the girl looking so much prettier and fatter than when he had left her . that he insisted that they should be married on the spot . and the mother , who did not know how to get rid of him , gave in . the next day the husband declared that he was very ill . and could not eat anything ; but this was only a presence so that he might get what he wanted .
some may attribute to the same cause the apparently humane and charitable actions which [male] . and indeed the other members of his family , are known frequently to perform , a beggar has seldom left their farm yard with an empty wallet . or without obtaining a night 's lodging , if required , with a sufficiency of potatoes and milk to satisfy even an irish beggar 's appetite . in appeasing which , account must usually be taken of the auxiliary jaws of a hungry dog . and of two or three still more hungry children , who line themselves well within .
`` then i will buy these , '' said [female] ; but [female] refused to sell them for money . the price she asked was permission to sleep a night in the chamber of echoes . `` as you will ; your bargains are cheap enough , '' replied [female] . laughing : and when she laughed she showed teeth like the tusks of a wild boar . now the king , when he was a blue bird .

soon afterwards an old man entered the cottage . and obtained leave to spend the night there , after a time the guest enquired why his host was so sad . and on learning the reason , told him to go again to his rich neighbor and borrow a quarter of malt . the moujik obeyed , and soon returned with the malt , which the old man ordered him to throw into his well . when this was done the villager and his guest went to bed .
no sooner did [male] realise that his daughter was gone . than , in furious anger against her and her lover , he gave chase . one has watched a hawk in pursuit of a pigeon or a bird of the moors and seen it . a little dark speck at first , gradually growing larger and more large until at length it dominated and conquered its prey . swooping down from above , like an arrow from a bow , to bring with it sudden death .

the italian villa can be adapted to the [location] climate and scenery and point of view . but it must be done by one of the architects who have made a deep study of the italian renaissance so the true feeling will be kept . there are some beautiful examples already in the country , in [person] . the chateaux which have most influenced country house building are those which were built during the sixteenth century . many of them during the reign of [person] 1st .
he entered the lodge , holding his head aloft as one conscious of good principle and shining with anger . he spoke not a word , but , placing the magic arrow to his bow . he would have laid his brothers dead at his feet . but just then the talking kettle stepped forward and spoke such words of wisdom . and the singing kettle trolled forth such a soothing little song .
[male] was one of the first to volunteer , but he only asked to go as aide de camp to the commander in chief . who was a gallant soldier and celebrated for his victories , as soon as the army could be got together it was marched to the frontier . where it met the opposing force headed by [male] himself . who was full of fury , determined to avenge the insult to his ambassador and to possess himself of the princess [male] . all the army of [male] could do , being so heavily outnumbered , was to act upon the defensive .
the good man was sorry to see this , and took the pains to summon men from the neighbouring cities . and get the bodies properly buried , he then resumed his journey . he came at last to the ends of the earth . here he found a magnificent golden palace , with an amber roof . and diamond doors and windows .

and , with this remark , the judge sat back , while [male] took up his pipe to play , `` stop , stop !

every inch of the way she trod the path which her stepsister had trodden . and saw the things which she had seen ; but there the likeness ended . when the fence prayed her to do it no harm . she laughed rudely , and tore up some of the stakes so that she might get over the more easily . when the oven offered her bread , she scattered the loaves onto the ground and stamped on them .

after that [female] went down stairs to her work again . and [female] lay staring out of the window at the windy gray clouds that were sweeping across the [male] sky . he grew lonelier and lonelier and a lump rose in his throat . presently a big tear trickled down his cheek and dripped off his chin . `` oh dear , oh dear , '' said a little voice just back of the hill his knees made as he lay with them drawn up in bed .

[male] son did not choose to lie under such obligation to [male] . without making the like return ; but was so much straitened for want of room in his house . that he could not entertain him so well as he wished . he therefore acquainted his father [male] with his intention . and told him that it did not look well for him to receive such favours from [male] .
but question of him what of pain in absence he doth bear . but for the ceaseless flood of tears my eyes pour forth . the world would at my burning all catch fire . yea , seas and lands and air . to god most high i make my moan of dear ones loved and lost .
the shoemaker 's boy was very willing to earn four shillings . and fetched the tinder box , gave it to the soldier . and -- yes -- now you shall hear , the soldier was already standing on the top of the [male] . but when they wanted to put the rope round his neck . he said that the fulfilment of one innocent request was always granted to a poor criminal before he underwent his punishment .
he climbed up the cliff where there was a steep water course in the face of the rock . got astride a smooth bit of wood as if it had been a hobby horse . and then scooted down the water course like a streak of lightning , this prank pleased the little wretch so mightily that he must needs have company to enjoy it the better ! so he whistled on a blade of grass till it rang over hill and [male] . and lo , from [male] and rock and osier clump the goblins came scuttling along .
his father did not know what to do in his excitement , he suggested an excuse and wanted to send [male] back to decline his bride with thanks . but this [female] was not willing to do , while they were arguing the matter . the bride 's carriage was already at the door . it was surrounded by a crowd of greencoats . and the lady entered the house , and bowed politely to her parents in law .

`` die , '' he cried ; and he uttered the words of power . the magic spell that the dark moon lady had taught him . then all its invincible natural weight came into the mass which the king held . and down it shot full on the body of the earthquaker . and where that had been was nothing but a vast abyss , silent , empty .

just as the cannibal brother , by a desperate effort of magic strength had freed himself from the jungle . and emerged in swift pursuit , he had the mortification of seeing the queen rush into her husband 's arms . his dreadful hunger was now increased until it drove him to desperation . with a roar of baffled rage he darted toward the royal couple . swearing that both of them should be his victims ; and this no doubt would have been the case .
linde walked on steadily , not very fast , for she was keenly on the look out for any signs or tokens to direct her . and most anxious not to miss the opening to what in her own mind she called `` the feather path .

it was still , glaring dully , then , as the boat touched the beach beneath the tower .

and so hour after hour and day after day our [person] goes on pumping up water and ammonia from its roots to its leaves . drinking in carbonic acid from the air , and using the sun waves to work them all up into food to be sent to all parts of its body . in this way these leaves act , you see . as the stomach of the plant , and digest its food . plants which only live one year , such as mignonette .
nothing could be more prudent than this advice , the good man . conformably to it , re entered the saloon with his daughter . seated together on the sofa , they saw the breakfast instantly served . the father ate with more appetite than he had done the preceding night . that which had come to pass had diminished his despair and revived his confidence , he would have departed without concern if the beast had not had the cruelty to make him understand that he must not dream of seeing his palace again .
there was once upon a time a husbandman who had three sons . he had no property to bequeath to them . and no means of putting them in the way of getting a living . and did not know what to do , so he said that they had his leave to take to anything they most fancied . and go to any place they best liked , he would gladly accompany them for some part of their way .

these mulgars have long silken , black-and-white hair and very profuse [male] . they are sad in face , with pouting lips . have but the meanest of thumbs , and turn their toes in as they walk . one behind another , and sometimes in chains of a hundred together , [male] stood in their path . and inquired of the first of them , as before , which way they must follow to cross the mountains .
with these words he tried to slip back into his house . but the tailor laid hold of his coat tails . and begged so hard to be allowed to stay that the old fellow , who was by no means as cross as he appeared . was at length touched by his entreaties , let him come in . and after giving him some food , showed him quite a nice bed in one corner of the room .
suddenly he remembered that he had heard his mother say . all the tiny folk made their home in the cowsheds . and , at once , he concluded to go there , and see if he could not find the elf . it was a lucky thing that the cottage door stood partly open . for he never could have reached the bolt and opened it .
a very rare block front chest of drawers with the original brasses . the average country house is neither very magnificent nor very simple , but strikes the happy medium and achieves a most delightful home-like charm . which at the very outset makes life seem well worth living , it is rarely furnished in a period style throughout . but has the modern air of comfort which good taste and correct feeling give . for instance , the hall may have paneling and [person] mirror .
they did the same by another son , at the third lying in of the sultana [female] resolved to be present . and a beautiful princess appeared , the two infant princes having been thrown at the gate of one of the royal palaces . were taken up by the gardener and his wife , who brought them up as their own .

with this terrible announcement the whole family were speedily convoked , and great was the consternation at the idea of the foe of mankind being amongst them in visible form . in this appalling extremity , a considerable time elapsed before any one could brace up courage to face the enemy . or be prevailed on to go and inspect the cause of their alarm , at last the [person] . who chanced to be the most stout–hearted , ventured into the room when , instead of the personage . on account of whom such awful apprehensions were entertained , a great dog or calf–skin lay on the floor .

with a yell of horror he drew his sword and slashed about him . and that very moment the forms vanished , the thunder ceased . the dark cloud passed , and the sun shone out as bright as on a summer day . and then [male] knew the forms he had seen were those of the wild people of the glen . with renewed courage he pursued his way through the valley .

but when [male] went down to tell him about it . he did not seem to think it was such a hopeless matter after all . he was overjoyed that she had found the charm . and was sure that they could get it out of the box some way or other . well , the cat did not want to make that bargain at all , she was too fond of catching the rats whenever she could .

the words were hardly spoken , and [female] had no time even to unbuckle the bridle . when the [female] herself stood before him . and [male] could not bear to look at her , so horrible was she . she had not exactly a head , yet neither was she without one . she did not fly through the air , but neither did she walk upon the earth .
then the nurse cut off the princess 's hair . and at once it began to grow at a frightful rate , the king and queen and nurse busily packed it . as it grew , into the other scale , and gradually the scale went down a little . the prince stood waiting between the scales with his drawn sword . and just before the two were equal he struck , but during the time his sword took to flash through the air the princess 's hair grew a yard or two .

a high hedge of thorns soon grew around the palace . and every year it became higher and thicker . till at last the whole palace was surrounded and hidden , so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen . but there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping [male] rose . for thus was the king 's daughter called ; so that from time to time several kings
but he was a very different figure from the confused mass of white and black that had appeared for an instant in the doorway . he was buttoned and buckled up to his bursting eyeballs in the most brilliant fashion . a tall black hat was tilted on his broad black head -- a hat of the sort that the french wit has compared to eight mirrors . but somehow the black man was like the black hat , he also was black . and yet his glossy skin flung back the light at eight angles or more .
the brother and sister pitied and tried to console each other , [male] especially lamented his talkativeness . which had brought all this misfortune upon them , at day break the duck flew away . after promising to visit her brother every night , after this intercourse had lasted some time . one night she did not make her appearance . which threw poor [male] into the greatest anxiety , for he feared she might .

he took a hearty leave of all at home . and rode away , provided with good abilities and good intentions , the swallows escorted him . and he followed the swans ; and he stood far from his home in the wide world . but he experienced the fact that one may have too much of a good thing . his hearing was too fine , he not only heard the grass grow .

this accident led to the first order being issued by the provosts . to the effect that breeding pigs within the town was forbidden . custom , however , deep rooted for centuries , resisted this order . and many others on the same subject which followed it . for we find , under [male] , a license was issued to the executioner .
from man to god passed the eyes of [male] . and back from god to man , and the stars forgot to twinkle . and [male] 's silver maned horses pawed the blue floor of the sky . impatient at the firm hand of the [male] on the reins that checked their eager course . [male] at last , in low words that seemed to come `` remembered from other worlds . ''
not a glowworm was glittering in the moss , sorrowfully [female] laid herself down to sleep . after a while it seemed to her as if the branches of the trees parted over her head and the mild eyes of angels looked down upon her from heaven . in the morning , when she awoke , she knew not whether this had really been so or whether she had dreamed it . she continued her wandering . but she had not gone far when she met an old woman who had berries in her basket and who gave her a few to eat .
soon [female] , their mother , came down the walk to speak with them . she was simply dressed in a plain white robe . her arms and feet were bare , as was the custom in those days . and no rings nor chains glit tered about her hands and neck . for her only crown , long braids of soft brown hair were coiled about her head .
but no amount of sagacity will teach a person that an itching in the point of his nose prognosticates the receipt of important news . or the [male] calling on the house top the death of one of the inmates within the year . his utmost acuteness will fail to find in a shoulder blade any indication of destiny . or any prophetic meaning in the sediment of a cup of tea . the meaning of these is a mystery to the uninitiated , and it is easy to see how they might be reduced to a system and lead to the wildest delusions of fortune telling .
he groped hither and thither , holding up his eyelids with his hands . and scarcely able to totter along , while his snowy beard now fell to his knees . but found nothing except a dilapidated old chest , which he opened . it seemed empty , but as he raised the lid a voice from the bottom said . welcome , if you had kept me waiting much longer .
but this priest -- he was an italian -- was suffering from poverty , and could receive his guest but for a few weeks . one day as [male] sat studying , he saw . the legend says , a white mouse come from a crack in the wall . a visitor which climbed upon his table and left there a grain of wheat . then the mouse paused , looked at the student , then ran about the table .
the ark was an exceedingly good sea craft . it rode the waves and breasted the gale without a mishap . some of the animals became sea sick , but this , of course . was to be expected , even captain [male] himself felt rather [male] at times . and as for little [male] , he kept to his bed for almost a week .
for mere cold ; yes , it was enough to make one feel cold to think of this . the poor little duckling certainly had not a good time , one evening the sun was just setting in his beauty there came a whole flock of great . handsome birds out of the bushes ; they were dazzlingly white . with long , flexible necks ; they were swans . they uttered a very peculiar cry , spread forth their glorious great wings .
`` well , i will just get in and show you , '' said the spirit . and after turning and twisting , and curling himself up , then he lay neatly packed into the hole . then [male] drew the bolt , and , picking the books up under his arm . he left the cave , for the next few weeks [male] hardly ate or slept . so busy was he in learning the magic the books contained .
he went over to the bed , and , stooping over the wounded merman . washed and dressed the hurt as well as he could ; and the touch of his hands appeared to work like magic . for no sooner had he finished than the wound seemed to deaden and die . leaving only the scar , and the old seal sprang up , as well as ever . then there was great rejoicing throughout the whole palace of the seals , they laughed .
then the monkey made such an uproar with his cries and shouts that very soon monkeys came running from all directions . there were big monkeys and little monkeys and middle sized monkeys . a whole army of monkeys had come to the aid of the biggest monkey . this is what all the big sized , little sized , middle sized monkeys did , the monkey with the loudest voice on top of the pyramid made the sun hear . the sun came at once , the sun poured his hottest rays down upon the wax .
so word was sent to all little people in the mines and hills . instructing them how they were to act and what they were to do . some of the new teachers , who were foreigners , and did not know the customs of the country . were very rude and rough , every day they hurt the feelings of the people . with their axes they cut down the sacred trees .
king [male] hastened back to the palace . and , i suppose , the servants knew not what to make of it when they saw their royal master so carefully bringing home an earthen pitcher of water . but that water , which was to undo all the mischief that his folly had wrought . was more precious to [male] than an ocean of molten gold could have been . the first thing he did , as you need hardly be told .
we must not forget that this queen , who became successively the wife of [female] . and of [female] , had taken care to establish a strict discipline amongst the young men and women who composed her court . she rightly considered herself the guardian of the honour of the former . and of the virtue of the latter ; therefore , as long as she lived . her court was renowned for purity and politeness .
when the thread of the nettles was spun she wove it with her shuttle . and then cut the shroud and began to sew it , and as before , when she sewed the count felt his pains grow less . and the life sinking within him . and when the needle made the last stitch he gave his last sigh . at the same hour [male] returned to the country .
with that he curved his back , [female] put her arms round his neck and nestled down in the soft white fur . and [female] gave a great leap off the edge of the cloud , and away ! down they went through the empty air like a live snowball . and it seemed to [female] that they never would have done falling . at length , however , they alighted safely on the top of a haystack .
the next morning it was still raining , and his mother told him to go wait for the bus . but if it did not come when it should , to come back home . and his father surprised him by saying he would be staying home if it kept on raining . the room he was working on in the cavern would probably be flooded . and he would not be able to work , when [male] felt he had waited long enough .
she began that moment a very gallant conversation with [female] with the tuft . which she kept up at such a rate that [male] with the tuft believed he had given her more sense than he had reserved for himself . when she returned to the palace , the whole court knew not what to think of such a sudden and extraordinary change . for they heard from her now as much sensible discourse and as many infinitely witty phrases as they had heard stupid and silly impertinences before . the whole court was overjoyed beyond imagination at it .
so he sent his messengers to the ship bidding simple come to the palace and make ready for the wedding . and prepared a bath for him , and when simple entered the room for the bath he found that it was heated so hot that the walls burned his hands when he touched them . and the floors were like red hot iron , but the man with the straw had come in behind him . warned by the man with the wonderful hearing , and seeing what was afoot . scattered his straw all about the bathroom , and at once it became as cold as one could wish .
but the mountain belonged to fierce and huge giants , who lived on it and traded there . and he had not sat long before he saw three of them striding towards him . so he lay down as if he had fallen into a deep sleep . the hunter now lay down and slept off his weariness , when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head of the bad and a head of the good cabbage , thinking , this will help me to regain my own , and to punish faithlessness. then he put the heads in his pockets .
the day was hot , and after a while the man began to grow sleepy . two of his eyes closed , and [male] sang gently , in a moment a third eye shut . and [male] sang on , the lid of a fourth eye dropped heavily . and then those of the fifth and the sixth , the black man was asleep altogether . then , on tiptoe , the idiot crept back to the colt .
a fearful squall arose as from the very bosom of the ocean . lightning played around the doomed ship , half blinded by it . and bewildered by the deafening noise of thunder , [female] just caught a glimpse of the fish king in the water near . before burying her face in her hands to escape the blinding glare of the second flash . starting suddenly at the terrifying clap of thunder that followed , she lost her balance and fell off the sea serpent 's back headlong into the surging waters .
téphany tried to stammer some excuse , but her aunt was half mad with rage . and a box on the ears was her only answer . at this [female] , hurt , bewildered and excited , could control herself no longer . and turning away burst into tears , but what was her surprise when she saw that each tear drop was a round and shining [female] . [female] , who also beheld this marvel , uttered a cry of astonishment .
`` fair persian , '' said [male] ad deen . immediately addressing himself to her , i ask that favour of you . and i hope you will not refuse me , she took up the lute without more entreaties . and putting it presently in tune , played and sung with such an air . as charmed the very soul of the [female] , afterwards she played upon the lute without singing .
so they waited for one month , for two , for six , for a year . the spinner spun no more , the count had ceased to persecute her . but he still refused his consent to the marriage . [male] became impatient , the poor girl loved him with her whole soul . and she was more unhappy than she had been before , when [female] was only tormenting her body .
thus saying , she dried her tears . ate some of her bread and strawberries , sat down to the spinning wheel . and began to spin by the light of the moon , the time went by quickly . as she worked , and it was daylight before she knew . and there was no more flax left ; she had spun out the last distaff full .
she spent the rest of the day gazing at the picture . which certainly had the effect of spoiling all the merman 's hopes or prospects . after some days , the fairy marina came back to hear what was decided ; but [female] hardly paid any attention to her . and showed such dislike to the idea of the proposed marriage that the fairy went off in a regular huff . without knowing it , the princess had made another conquest .
he kept along the shore , begging his bread at the door of solitary huts for the love of god . and joyfully receiving insults , refusals , or threats . he feared neither robbers nor wild beasts . but he took great care to avoid all the towns and villages he came near . he was afraid lest he should see children playing at knuckle bones before their father 's house .
it is curious to notice with what ingenuity and how readily parliament took advantage of the most trifling circumstances or of charges based upon the very slightest grounds to summon the officers of the châtelet before its bar on suspicion of prevarication or of outrages against religion . morals , or the laws , often were these officers and the provost himself summoned to appear and make amende honourable before the assembly . notwithstanding which they retained their offices , more than once an officer of the châtelet was condemned to death and executed . but the king always annulled that part of the sentence which had reference to the confiscation of the goods of the condemned . thus proving that in reality the condemnation had been unjust , although for grave reasons the royal authority had been unable to save the victim from the avenging power of parliament .
[female] ran away immediately for some fire , while the princess went to look out at the window . [male] , unwilling to let his performance be burned , took this opportunity to convey it away without being perceived . he had hardly quitted the cabinet , when the princess turned about to look once more upon that enchanting picture . which had so delighted her , but how was she surprised to find it gone ! she sought for it all the room over .
this he did very willingly , and she set before him food and drink that he had never seen the like of before . in the room there was a bed , with diamond rings hanging at every loop of the curtains . and everything that was in the room besides astonished him so much that he actually forgot that he was hungry . when she saw that he was not eating at all , she asked him what he wanted yet . to which he replied that he would neither eat nor drink until he knew who she was .
for the first time since her arrival , [female] had gone out without asking [male] to accompany him . he went to gather figs and grapes by himself . or to seek whatever amusement he could find , in other society than his little playfellow 's . he was tired to death of hearing about the box . and heartily wished that [male] , or whatever was the messenger 's name .
well , well , she was a noble little dot in such things . and it must have been an obdurate nature that could have withstood her influence . when she had got poor [male] and his [male] away . that they might comfort and console each other , as she knew they only could . she presently came bouncing back , -- the saying is , as fresh as any [male] .
but she hid her feelings . and , pretending to be very kind , she called them to her and joked with them . and led them into a beautiful room , where she gave them food to eat . and showed them a soft cushion on which they might sleep . then she left them and went down into the palace kitchens .
when the whole buffalo skin had been cut into narrow strips . he tied the strips together , they made a long cord that would reach over a long trail . in amazement the indians watched the white man while he measured off a seat as long and as broad as this cord would reach around . the `` small seat , '' the size of a buffalo skin . became a tract of land , soon the white man asked for another seat .
the old man tried to pacify her by showing her the box of presents he had brought back with him . and then he told her of all that had happened to him . and how wonderfully he had been entertained at the sparrow 's house . `` now let [location] see what is in the box , '' said the old man . not giving her time to [male] again , `` you must help me open it . ''
we had had some firing a few days ago at presumptive stores . also at a dhow and lighter dimly descried ( they were in the papyrus fringed labyrinth of a boat passage ) . but of late we had been lying up for the most part off a lonely island . perhaps they would think we were out of the way , perhaps not . we should see what we should see , i suppose that the gunnery lieutenant was almost as sanguine of adventure as i was of humdrum peace in this after dinner hour on the darkened bridge .
margad was left alone in the kitchen when her [female] had gone to bed . and at first she was [female] with fright . but she was a middling brave girl . and she took a notion , as there was no person to stop her . to see if all the things were true that she had heard about old christmas [female] .
[male] then went up to the king , and gave his majesty an account of all his fierce battles . [male] 's fame had spread through the whole country . and , at the king 's desire , the duke gave him his daughter in marriage . to the joy of all the kingdom , after this , the king gave [male] a large estate . on which he and his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and content .
alas , how many fears and doubts alarm the [female] who on love her hopes would rest . a look , a word , her youthful heart may charm . but constancy alone can make it blest , the handsome shepherd judged by these verses that he was indebted to love for his agreeable adventure . the sun , by this time , had set , [male] , absorbed in a delightful reverie . bent his steps towards his cottage , he did not observe any change in its exterior .
this slight was more than the spoiled damsel could bear , she fell sick with love and anger . and for many days lay in bed , pondering how she should win the love of sir [male] . a full week went by , and still she had never had speech of him . nor had even so much as caught sight of him as he followed her father to the chase . but one morning her lady brought her word .
when she stood there in full array , she was dazzlingly beautiful . so that the court bowed deeper than ever , and the king chose her for his bride . although the archbishop shook his head and whispered that the beauteous fresh maid was certainly a witch . who blinded the eyes and led astray the heart of the king . but the king gave no ear to this , but ordered that the music should sound .
this lake is said to be so deep that it is unfathomable ; it is dark brown in colour . bitter and brackish to the taste . no fish can live in it , learned men , called geologists . who study the crust of the earth , have decided that this region is not volcanic in origin as it would appear at first sight . but that the lake is fed by water from the morass .
in short , the bird lighted , and sat over the egg to hatch it . as i perceived her coming , i crept close to the egg . so that i had before me one of the legs of the bird . which was as big as the trunk of a tree , i tied myself strongly to it with the cloth that went round my turban . in hopes that when the [female] flew away next morning she would carry me with her out of this desert island .
the girl looked at him , and then rose and put her gloves on . yes , she said , i ll be there ; and almost instantly left the place . that night the detective and the priest were still talking of the matter as they drew near the fulham house . a tenement strangely mean even for a temporary residence of the carstairs family . taking a latchkey from the girl and the coin from hawker .
after a little he looked about him , and began scratching his ears as if he was quite tired . and says he , `` i may as well begin first as last , '' the poor boy 's teeth began to chatter in his head . for , says he , now he 's going to ate me ', . but the fellow with the long ears and tail on him had something else to do . he stirred the fire , and then he brought in a pail of water from the pump .
a little cry of horror arose from the gay group about the princess . as they looked at one another , wondering who the shocking early riser could be , the princess looked sharply at [female] and said . tell [location] the name of the [female] . sirrah , and you shall be pardoned of your grievous fault . at these words the princess started , and her cheek flushed .
the king now understood how the queen he had had for some time past had been so ill tempered . he at once had a sack drawn over her head and made her be stoned to death . and after that torn in pieces by untamed horses . the two young fellows also told now what they had heard and seen in the queen 's room . for before this they had been afraid to say anything about it .
now they marched gladly through the highways to the town . it took four of them to carry [male] 's head . on they went , all fourteen , their captain glorious in their midst . they entered the great hall , startling the king and queen . as they sat at meat , with the fearful sight of [female] 's head .
now it so happened that [female] had a sister named granua . living opposite them , on the very top of cullamore , which i have mentioned already . and this granua was quite as powerful as herself , the beautiful valley that lies between them is not more than about three or four miles broad . so that of a summer 's evening , granua and [female] were able to hold many an agreeable conversation across it . from the one hill top to the other , upon this occasion [female] resolved to consult her sister as to what was best to be done in the difficulty that surrounded them .
the next morning the bee man saw the lord of the domain walking in his gardens . he slipped along the shady paths , and followed him so as to observe him closely . and find out if he were really drawn toward this noble and handsome being , the lord of the domain walked on for some time . not noticing that the bee man was behind him , but suddenly turning . he saw the little old man , what are you doing here .
`` tweet , tweet , '' sounded over her head suddenly . she looked up , and there was the swallow himself flying close by . as soon as he spied tiny , he was delighted ; and then she told him how unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole . and to live always beneath the earth , and never to see the bright sun any more . and as she told him she wept .
the artificial bird was put on silken cushions by the emperor 's bed . all the presents which it received , gold and precious stones . lay round it , and it was given the title of imperial night singer . first from the left , for the emperor counted that side as the more distinguished . being the side on which the heart is ; the emperor 's heart is also on the left .
one day , walking about in [male] of game . he came to a small lake , it was in the winter season . and upon the ice of the lake he saw a man of giant height . employed in killing beavers , comparing himself with this great man . he felt that he was no bigger than an insect .
for seven years he led the life of a hunted animal . often cold and nearly always hungry , and never daring to allow himself a sound sleep . at the end of that time his wolf skin wore out also . and again he appeared at the cottage door . but the second seven years had taught him no more than the first -- his conduct was worse than before .
then , in 1860 , when [female] was about forty years old , there came a great change . his heaven born genius for making the appreciation of beauty a common possession was deflected from its true field . he had been asking himself what are the conditions that produce great art . and the answer he found declared that art can not be separated from life . nor life from industry and industrial conditions .
cuglas , nothing daunted , pushed on boldly until a bank of cloud shut out completely the struggling moon . and closing over the valley covered it like a pall . leaving him in perfect darkness . at the same moment the moaning wind died away . and with it died away all sound , the darkness and the death like silence sent an icy chill to the heart of [male] .
therefore , if ice did no more than carry these stone blocks . it would alter the face of the country . but it does much more than this , as the glacier moves along . it often cracks for a considerable way across its surface . and this crack widens and widens , until at last it becomes a great gaping chasm .
prince [male] had kept his eyes constantly turned in the direction of the tower . awaiting the return of his courier , at length he saw the blessed pigeon approaching . but what were his feelings as soon as he could discern that the bird had fastened round his neck the same case that he had taken away with him ! he was nearly dying with grief , the fairy . who had never left him , consoled him as well as she could .
a commission of three judges was appointed to investigate , they made fullest inquiry and finally laid a document before the king summarizing what they did not hesitate to declare the infamous actions of his royal highness . the crown prince , the king 's sense of justice and righteousness at once overcame his foolish pride . he summoned his son to appear before him . and the prince entered the royal justice chamber with the air of a braggart . smiling contemptuously at the learned judges who were seated to right and left of his majesty .
the queen , to win king charming for her daughter . made him many presents ; among the rest an order of knighthood . a golden heart , enamelled in flame colour , surrounded with many arrows , but pierced by one only . the motto being , `` she alone , '' the heart was made of a single [female] . as big as an ostrich 's egg , each arrow was a diamond .
a traveler hired an ass to convey him to a distant place . the day being intensely hot , and the sun shining in its strength . the traveler stopped to rest , and sought shelter from the heat under the shadow of the ass . as this afforded only [male] for one , and as the traveler and the owner of the ass both claimed it . a violent dispute arose between them as to which had the right to it .
when the hunter came home next morning his little daughter told him what had happened and what her mother said . so he set out to find his wife in the land east o the sun and west o ', the moon . and he wandered for many days till he came across an old man who had fallen on the ground . and he lifted him up and helped him to a seat and tended him till he felt better .
soon afterwards [male] came home and went to see his flower . he knew at once that some one had worn it and called to his mother and asked who it was . she protested that she knew nothing about the matter . but [male] said that he could tell by the smell that it had been worn and then he showed that there was also a hair sticking to the flower . then his mother admitted that in spite of all she could say .
the news of the return of the sons of [male] soon spread through the palace . and brought [male] himself to the scene . whereupon the strangers were presented to him , and were invited to a banquet which the king ordered to be prepared in their honour . all the most beautiful ladies of the court were present at this entertainment . but in the eyes of [male] none could compare with the king 's daughter .
but then a strange thing happened : the pearls began to lose their whiteness and grew quite dim in colour . then they grew blacker and blacker till at last they were just like so many cinders . [male] was so amazed that he could say nothing for himself . but the king said quite enough for both , and [male] was glad to get away home again as fast as his legs would carry him . to his father and brothers , however , he gave no account of his attempt .
meanwhile the tsarina [male] had a brave little son . her father was greatly rejoiced , and gave him the name of [male] . he had rosy cheeks , eyes like saucers . and a stout body : he was the image of his father . and the tsar , in his joy , ordered a great feast to be prepared .
in the evening there was a hearse seen before the door . and he was borne into it in his coffin . he was now to go out into the country , to lie in his grave . he was driven out there , but no one followed ; all his friends were dead . and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was driven away .
but soon after , when he had obtained an order in council to send the king away . which was done in great state , with a guard of honor composed of two whole regiments of soldiers . the nation learned , without much surprise , that the poor little prince . nobody ever called him king now . had gone a much longer journey than to the beautiful mountains , he had fallen ill on the road and died within a few hours .

he sat softly strumming on his mandolin and thinking . and suddenly the giantess had an idea , he was so excited that he jumped clean out of the window . mandolin , bag and all , when he reached the ground he wrapped himself in his cloak . pulled his hat well over his eyes and stuck the peacock 's feather in the front of it . `` now i look just like a wandering musician , '' he said .
valhalla , the hall of heroes . was the name of it , and it was roofed with the mighty shields of warriors . the ceiling was made of interlacing spears , and there was a portal at the west end before which hung a great gray wolf . while over him a fierce eagle hovered , the hall was so huge that it had 540 gates . through each of which 800 men could march abreast , indeed , there needed to be room .
there lived in the same town a rich man who was called the count . sometimes the count would have a grand dinner , and his rich friends from other towns would come to visit him . then [male] 's grandfather would go up to the count 's house to help with the work in the kitchen . for he was a fine cook as well as a good stone cut ter . it happened one day that [male] went with his grandfather to the count 's great house .
as the caravan was passing through [female] , [female] took the opportunity to visit the temple . which is considered by all mussulmans as the most sacred after that of mecca , and from which the place itself has obtained the title of the holy city . [male] found the city of [male] so delicious a spot . from the abundance of its streams , its meadows . and enchanting gardens , that everything he had read of its delights .

the little white hen was roughly seized by the tallest royal attendant and carried down the back stairs . through the back gate , out into the royal [female] yard . she still clung to the little brown basket which she had brought with her on her long journey to the royal palace and through all the sad experiences she had met there . when the little white hen reached the royal [female] yard all the royal fowls flew at her . some plucked at her rumpled white feathers , others tried to pick out her eyes .
but the reflected light waves do more for [location] than this , they not only make [location] see things . but they make [location] see them in different colours . what , you will ask , is this too the work of the sunbeams , certainly . for if the colour we see depends on the size of the waves which come back to us . then we must see things coloured differently according to the waves they send back .
graciosa entered , and passing through many a lovely forest glade . where it was clear daylight , and shepherds and shepherdesses were dancing to merry music . they reached the palace , where the queen and her two daughters received the forlorn princess with great kindness . and led her through many rooms of rock crystal , glittering with jewels . where , to her amazement , [female] saw the history of her own life .
on this scrap of paper were written three pieces of advice . first , if a person is travelling and reaches any strange place at night . let him be careful where he puts up , and not close his eyes in sleep . lest he close them in death . secondly , if a man has a married sister , and visits her in great pomp .
but the dog only whined and pulled her toward the door . at last [female] went outdoors to see what was the matter . then jumper left her and ran back into the schoolroom , he took hold of the dress of one of the little girls and tugged and tugged . at length she too followed jumper to the door . by this time all the children were on their feet and quickly followed the teacher out of the schoolroom .
thus must god , in an infinitely greater degree , have the same knowledge of the whole created globes of his universe . as of our earth and the human race here , he must know when that development . that flowering in the human race ordained by himself , shall come to pass ; when the powers of intellect . of full development , are to reign ; and under these characters , come to a maturity of development . men will become mighty , driving wheels .
on the evening when this tale begins the king was watching the three princes play at ball . the ball was of scented spanish leather covered with [male] silk on which was stamped the sporting dolphin of the royal house . sometimes it would drop to the green turf where the parrots would [male] at it . thinking it a gorgeous apple , the hooded falcon on the jester 's arm knew better . for the jester fed him real apples .
the pocket referred to means the bottom of the long sleeve . which is apt to trail and get wet when a child stoops at play . kiyomadzu may mean a famous temple that bears that name . sometimes they would simply count the turns and make a sort of game of forfeiting and returning the number of rebounds kept up by each . [male] had begun to think battledore and balls too girlish an amusement .
her sisters made a grab to snatch it from her . but [female] shoved them back , and went out , and [female] rode away with the mare after dinner and left her in the wood . when he came back to his garden he always came in the [male] shape and always pretended he had been off on a message for the king . the third day he went to the wood again . he dressed in the suit in which he had gone to the first battle .
there are not wanting , however , in some of the decorated ornaments of the time . distinct signs of the influence of these discoveries . drawings and reproductions from frescoes . found in these old italian cities , were in the possession of the draughtsmen and designers of the time . and an instance in point of their adaptation is to be seen in the small boudoir of the marquise de serilly .
the floor was carpeted with yellow satin , and yellow curtains hung at the window . deep blue mirrors lined the walls , and they reflected [male] and the beautiful wicked witch dozens of times over . the pretty bird cage , all made of flowers and leaves . hung in the very middle of the room , [male] stood by it a long time . he put his fingers through the bars .
the king was very angry and would have sent for [male] at once , but [male] counseled [male] . then he wrote the second letter , this was to [male] and was forged with the king 's name and sealed with the king 's seal which he obtained . it bade [male] on the tenth of the next month to assemble the troops on the eagle plain to show how numerous they were to the foreign envoys and to pretend to attack the king . so as to demonstrate how well they were drilled , the vizier returned the day before the review . and while the king stood with [male] and the foreign envoys .
he , however , always contrived to escape the danger , although the dogs often had their claws in the hair of his back . and the hunters aimed many a shot at him . he concealed himself for the moment . and when the noise ceased and the bugles no longer resounded , he returned to the thicket . which was close to the castle , and lay in the sunny spots where .
there was once a man living in the south of the island whose name was [male] . he was a farmer , and he had [male] on his street . sheep on the mountain , and cattle in the meadow land alongside the river . his cows were the best cows in the parish . nowhere could you see such a fine head of cattle as he had .
they had a quick voyage , and it was not long before [male] found himself again in the streets of the capital of kungla . playing as he went along , the people had heard no music like his since he went away . and they crowded round him . and in their joy gave him whatever money they had in their pockets . his first care was to buy himself some new clothes .
the next morning , after [female] had been informed of the affair . he and prince [male] set out for the sultan 's court . when they arrived at the gates of the capital the people no sooner saw [male] but they ran and hid themselves . and some shut up their shops and locked themselves up in their houses . while others , flying , communicated their fear to all they met .
[ more sweetly. ] no , [female] , indeed you could not . [ she puts her hand on [female] 's shoulder . ] and we shall be friends still ? why , of course , of course , dear [female] . it was only the -- the surprise , you know how fond i am of you .
the old woman loved her own daughters . and gave them red kisel jelly every day . and honey too , as much as they could put into their greedy little mouths . but poor little [female] , the eldest , she got only what the others left . when they were cross they threw away what they left .
in the center of this church , or whatever it was . [male] saw the famous fountain on whose account he had taken so long a journey . a fountain like any other , with nothing extraordinary about it . one could not help wondering that the fairy [female] allowed it to be in her room . it had staves such as were used in ancient times .
flann 's heart , i tell you . sank , when he saw the bull that guarded [male] 's house . they went through the deep wood then , and came to the gate of the giant 's keep . only a chain was across it , and [male] lifted up the chain . the courtyard was filled with cattle black and red and striped , the giant tied [male] to a stone pillar .
`` pride must suffer pain , '' replied the old lady . oh , how gladly she would have shaken off all this grandeur , and laid aside the heavy wreath ! the red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better . but she could not help herself : so she said . `` farewell , '' and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water .
the young knight bowed as he prepared to obey the lady 's commands . with a [male] and softness hitherto unwonted . the tones resounded from his lips , and the wild song appeared to transform itself . and to bloom into a garden of the blessed , tears stood in [male] 's eyes . and [male] , as he gazed on the pearly brightness .
little red riding [male] is the evening sun . which is always described as red or golden ; the old grandmother is the earth . to whom the rays of the sun bring warmth and comfort . the wolf -- which is a well-known figure for the clouds and blackness of night . is the dragon in another form ; first he devours the grandmother .
it was evident that she was preparing herself to explain something in detail . but suddenly she hesitated , as if seized with an inward shuddering . and burst out into a flood of tears , they none of them knew what to make of this ebullition . and filled with various apprehensions they gazed at her in silence . at length , wiping away her tears , and looking earnestly at the reverend man .
there was once upon a time a good sort of man named [male] aniello . who had three daughters , rose , pink , and violet , the last of whom was so beautiful that her very look was a syrup of love . which cured the hearts of beholders of all unhappiness . the king 's son was burning with love of her . and every time he passed by the little cottage where these three sisters sat at work .
directly breakfast was over they launched the little boat , and started . the snow shone white in the [female] , and the calm sea against the snow was as blue as a blue lotus . but the shadows on the snow were a wonder . and the woven complexity of their colorings would have taxed every hue on an artist 's palette . so they pulled down and into the cave , at whose mouth the great [male] looked barer and blacker than ever against the world 's whiteness .
he did not put it over his head as you might think from the size of the ring , no . he wore it on his arm . never was a bigger man seen by anyone living . the whole countryside stood outside their houses to see him come over the hills . when he came to where the stones are he stooped down to take a drink and he drank the well dry .
to them , too , did the gods grant a boon . that , for seven days before the shortest day of the year . and for seven days after it , there should reign over the sea a great calm in which [female] . in her floating nest , should hatch her young , and to those days of calm and [female] . the name of the halcyon days was given .
and now they were at home , but the poor duckling which had crept last out of the egg . and looked so ugly , was bitten and pushed and jeered , as much by the ducks as by the chickens . so it went on the first day ; and afterward it became worse and worse . the poor duckling was hunted about by every one ; even its brothers and sisters were quite angry with it . and said : `` if the cat would only catch you , you ugly creature ! ''
the two sons who survived him loved each other tenderly , and it was a real grief to the elder . [male] , that the laws of the empire forbade him to share his dominions with his brother schahzeman . indeed , after ten years , during which this state of things had not ceased to trouble him . [male] cut off the country of great tartary from the persian empire and made his brother king . now the sultan [male] had a wife whom he loved more than all the world .
clever [female] is very popular among the czechs and slovaks and is considered by them especially typical of their own folk wisdom and folk humor . and they are right : it is , but it would be rash to say just how early or how late this story began to be told among the peoples of the earth . the catch at the end appears in a story in the talmud and at that time it has all the marks of a long and honorable career . the story of the devil marrying a scold . another great favorite with the slavs , also has its talmudic parallel in the story of [female] .
the prince saw the bird 's meaning . but , to signify that he wanted to find the princess , he pointed to the picture . at this the bird spread its wings right out until the tips brushed against each side of the cave . the feathers quivering intensely and throwing out a bright light which almost blinded the prince . then the bird drew in its wings and made a sign to him to mount between them .
but while [female] stood still and wondered , there came a low rippling laugh to her ear . a little distance down the beach a girl . somewhat older than herself , rested on the beach , she evidently was tired from swimming . for she lay half in the water and half on the warm sand . her face resting on her upturned palms , looking at [female] with a smile .
when his companions saw in what an evil plight he was . they hastened to his help , and put him on his steed . for mount himself he could not . and held him up as he rode , ill content he was that he had ventured so much and won so little . sir [male] answered , `` speak on. ''
but at length with a careless or an ill judged stroke . he sent it flying over the heads of the players . and over the [male] fence of a garden near by . immediately he started after it , then his companions cried . `` stay , [male] ; here we have more than a dozen shuttlecocks . ''
she then tried to lift them up from the ground . but they , shedding bitter tears , would not rise , then the czar . looking at them with a frown , bade them get up . he allowed them , however , to stay in the palace . a magnificent entertainment then began : the palace was splendidly lighted up , and looked like the sun among the clouds .
the children , who were all at the door , cried out together , here we are . mother , here we are , she flew like lightning to let them in . and kissed every one of them , before it was quite dark , [male] climbed up to the top of a tree . and looked round on all sides to see if he could find any way of getting help . he saw a small light , like that of a candle .
and there are probably many among the young who think in the same way , but when people are old . and have become accustomed to being satisfied with little , then they are more happy over the visby that exists . than over a magnificent vineta at the bottom of the sea . the wild geese had made a good trip over the sea . and had lighted in tjust township , in northern småland , that township did not seem able to make up its mind whether it wanted to be land or sea .
the ceremony , which was ordered by the mikado himself . took place at 10.30 at night in the temple of seifukuji . the headquarters of the satsuma troops at hiogo . a witness was sent from each of the foreign legations , we were seven foreigners in all . we were conducted to the temple by officers of the princes of satsuma and choshiu .
next morning , when all was ready for the journey , when the horses were stamping impatiently before the door . the family all assembled to conform to an old icelandic custom , in that island . before any family partake of the sacrament . each member asks forgiveness of all the rest for wrongs consciously or unconsciously committed . [female] took her father 's hand and her husband 's .
and when the thunder rumbled and flashes of lightning shot through the leaves . and the owls shut their eyes in terror and the poor little fireflies put out their lights . they would whisper to each other that the dragon was around , and scamper away and hide until morning . and then when it was daylight they wouldn t be a bit frightened . and each one would say the other ran first , and he only ran because some one behind pushed him and he couldn
tears away everything green , and makes it as gray as itself . then it meets still another obstacle , with this it does the same thing . and still another , yes , the same thing happens to this also , it is stripped and plundered . as if it had fallen into robbers hands . then the obstacles come nearer and nearer together . and then the sea must understand that the land sends toward it her littlest children .
`` come away ; it is time , and a lovely night , '' called the mermaids , and with several new friends they all hurried up to watch the buds open when the moon kissed them . the sea shone like silver . the stars seemed to float there as well as in the sky , and the wind blew off the shore bringing the sweet smell of hay fields and gardens . all the sea people sang as they lay rocking on the quiet waves .
when day broke , they pushed forward , the sun now shone for [female] on new mountains . new glaciers , and snow fields , they were now in the canton of vallais . and had crossed the range which could be seen from grindelwald , but were yet far from his new home . other ravines , other pastures , woods , and mountain paths now came into sight . other houses , and other people ; but they were strange and deformed looking beings .
hearing no more , he soon quitted the stream , hoping at least to get rid of the sight of himself . but he had scarcely gone twenty paces when he tumbled into a pitfall that was laid to catch bears . the bear hunters , descending from some trees hard by , caught him . chained him , and only too delighted to get hold of such a curious looking animal . led him along with them to the capital of his own kingdom .
joy was in the hearts of the three sons of usna when they came back to the home of their fathers . usna was dead , but beyond the falls of [male] was still the great [male] . the vitrified fort -- which he had built for himself and for those who should follow him . for [male] then began a time of perfect happiness . [female] was her heart , but very dear to her also were the brothers of [female] .
such a beautiful animal would be disgraced were i not to put on him the good saddle . which becomes him so well , however , no sooner did the horse feel the golden saddle touch him than he began to neigh . and the grooms all awoke , seized the king 's son and threw him into prison . the next morning he was delivered up to justice and condemned to death . but the king promised him his life .
[female] burned with impatience , would she indeed learn the fate of her dear friends at the palace ? in spite of her extreme anxiety , she dared not ask a single question . if she could have descended from the back of the tortoise . ten minutes would have sufficed for her to reach the castle , but , alas ! the tortoise crept on slowly and [female] remembered that she had been forbidden to alight or to utter a word . she resolved , therefore , to control her impatience , the tortoise seemed rather to relax than to increase her speed .
i imagined it might be occasioned by reason of the distance from your dominions . or that love might have a great share in it . and that the queen of samarcande , who , no doubt . is an accomplished beauty , might be the cause of it . i do not know if i be mistaken ; but i must own that this was the peculiar reason why i did not importune you upon the subject .
he was very cold , for he had even forgotten his cap in his haste . but the snowflakes powdered his hair till he looked as if he wore a white one . he could scarcely pucker up his mouth to whistle , his feet were numb and his fingers tingled . and the wind sang in his ears till he was as sleepy as sleepy could be . `` i will sit down and rest , '' said [male] to himself .
thus the day wore on and darkness fell over the land . by this time girl and goose were fast asleep in one corner of the miser 's room and knew nothing more of what was happening . when the first light of a new day filtered through the paper covered window above the miser 's bed . [female] awoke with a start , and at first she could not think where she was . [female] was staring at her with wide-open frightened eyes that seemed to be asking .
a people so deeply imbued with religious ideas as the egyptians doubtless carried their habits of worship beyond the temple gates . but unfortunately we have no graphic or connected view of their private devotions . at the present day a few natives will scrupulously follow the daily ritual of [organization] . many keep up some convenient portion , such as the religious aspect of an evening bath after the day 's work . but most of the peasantry have little or no religious observances , perhaps the average of mankind does not differ very greatly .
soon there was heard a great whispering among the mermaid band . and one of the boldest of them ventured to suggest to the dowager lady in waiting . that one reason for her majesty 's continued swoon might be that her hair was plaited too tight . the dowager , for a wonder , took the suggestion in good part . she ordered the attendants to unpin her majesty 's long golden braids .
soon after , the tsar sent for the princes whom his eldest daughters had chosen for husbands . they obeyed the invitation instantly , and came with all speed to [location] . and the weddings were celebrated , the princess [female] also was married to [male] the peasant 's son . and her elder sisters laughed at her for choosing a fool for a husband . not long afterwards a great army invaded the country .
and night after night , for eight nights . this went on , then , on the ninth night , when the fires around him had been lighted . [male] lifted up his voice and began to sing a song . his song became louder and louder , and the king and the king 's friends and the servants of the thing 's house had to stand still and harken to it . [male] sang about [male] , the king .
the false [female] melted away as snow melts in the [female] ! in a moment naught remained of her save only the empty girdle which once had compassed her waist . so on a day of storm we see a rainbow spanning the sky with all its goodly colours . and in a moment it vanishes from our sight . so did this lovely creature , the false [male] , vanish from before the eyes of that company .
[male] promised to observe their caution ; and for many days was so well amused in examining the magnificent rooms and curiosities of the palace . that he did not feel a wish to transgress till the forbidden door alone remained unopened . having then nothing to divert him , he could not resist the impulse of curiosity . but unlocked the door , which opened on a marble staircase by which he ascended to the terraced roof of the palace . from whence a most delightful prospect feasted his sight .
the greater part of the principal ceremonies of the middle ages acquired . from various accessory and local circumstances , a character of grandeur well fitted to impress the minds of the populace . on these memorable occasions the exhibition of some historical memorial . of certain traditional symbols , of certain relics , and c. . brought to the recollection the most celebrated events in national history .
`` they are makin '' a child 's coffin , ', he replied . they have the body already made , an they are now nailin the lid together , that night the child died . and the story goes that on the second evening afterwards . the carpenter who was called upon to make the coffin brought a table out from [male] 's house to the forth .

it was first a slow , caressing sound , then more and more lively and urgent . and so sonorous and piercing that it penetrated as far as the farthest alleys and retreats of the town . soon from the bottom of the cellars , the top of the garrets . from under all the furniture , from all the nooks and corners of the houses . out come the rats , search for the door .
just as we try to form various figures with little tablets of wood which we call `` a chinese puzzle . '' [male] 's fingers were very artistic ; it was the icy game of reason at which he played . and in his eyes the figures were very remarkable , and of the highest importance . this opinion was owing to the piece of glass still sticking in his eye . he composed many complete figures , forming different words .
on another old painting two figures are seated on [person] playing a game which resembles draughts . the pieces being moved about on a little table with black and white squares like a modern chessboard . with shaped feet to raise it a convenient height for the players . on the floor stand cups of tea ready to hand . such pictures are generally ascribed to the fifteenth century , the period of the great [person] dynasty .
then they rose up and went in search of food to a village where there was a bazar . and they tried to get employment as servants . but the people advised them to go to the capital city where the raja lived . and there if no one would take them as servants they could get employment as coolies on a big tank which the raja was excavating . so they went there , and as they could not get employment as servants they went to work at the tank with the common coolies and were paid their wages at the end of the week and so managed to live .
`` faster , '' cried the witch , and she threw her arms about his neck . and her breath was hot upon his face , `` faster , faster , '' she cried . and the earth seemed to spin beneath his feet , and his brain grew troubled . and a great terror fell on him , as of some evil thing that was watching him . and at last he became aware that under the shadow of a rock there was a figure that had not been there before .
a bird is connected with a death warning in the [female] family . whose country seat is hagley in [location] . the first [male] was a distinguished poet and historian , but his son . [male] , the second [male] , was known as `` the wicked lord [male] , '' a title he had won by his extravagances and profligacy .
a man 's home must ever be a sunny place to him . and it should be a wife 's most pleasant duty to drive for ever from his hearth side those hideous sister spirits . discontent and gloomy peevishness , this way that young wives have of punishing their husbands . always comes back upon themselves with double force , any man . however unreasonable he appears , may be influenced by kindly words and happy smiles .
he tied them all three with a rope . and drove them away till he came to a mill . he knocked at the window , and the miller put his head out and asked what he wanted . then the hunter said that to the old donkey which was the witch . three beatings and one meal ; to the younger one , which was the servant .
the two walked on hand in hand for a long way without meeting a single person . and [female] was just going to ask if anybody lived there when from behind a curtain there came toward them a man clad in scarlet and gold . carrying a long white wand in his hand , he bowed solemnly and . holding back the curtain , said : the king , my master . bids you welcome , be pleased to enter and refresh yourselves after your journey .
never had the children had such a treat , and being modest and unselfish and far from greedy they enjoyed it all the more . nor was there any necessity for their grandmother to warn them not to eat too much . so when the [female] and her grandchildren , with many and many expressions of gratitude . took their leave -- though , by the bye , i must not forget to tell you that what brought the poor things pleasure to the highest height was [male] 's telling them that he would expect them at the same hour and in the same way the following sunday .
she sent immediately to see if he was still in the port . and hearing that he had set sail a little before it was dark . and had stopped some time off the shore , while he sent his boat for water from the fountain . she doubted no longer of the prince 's ill fortune . so she commanded the commodore of ten men of war .
seeing this , the king was filled with renewed courage , and raising his voice . he said that he would rather pass the remainder of his life in this melancholy region than go away without them . he needed great [male] , for no king on earth ever spent such a wretched time before . he had only the ground , covered with briars and thorns . for his bed ; his food consisted of wild fruits .
weary of wandering over this vast dwelling , he stopped in a saloon . wherein was a large fire , presuming that it was prepared for some one . who would not be long in appearing , he drew near the fireplace to warm himself . but no one came , seated on a sofa near the fire . a sweet sleep closed his eyelids , and left him no longer in a condition to observe the entrance of any one .
but the metal pig lay motionless . while the fresh stream gushed forth from its mouth , the little boy still sat astride on its back . when he felt something pulling at his clothes . he looked down , and there was [female] , little smooth shaven [female] . barking as if she would have said , `` here i am too ; why are you sitting there ? ''
if king [male] was generous to bath , bath has been grateful in return . one statue of him adorns the principal street . and another graces the swimming pond , both speaking likenesses . the one represents him as he was before he divided his leprosy with the pigs . the other shows him as he appeared after breaking his neck .
he had no difficulty to open the door . which was only fastened with a latch , and he shut it again after he had entered . without any noise , when he entered the cell . he perceived [female] by moonlight lying in the air on a sofa covered only by an old mat . with her head leaning against the wall , he awakened her .
the bells of heaven began to ring , began to ring , etc , mr. [male] says that [male] parish church was the scene of a procession similar to that described in the above legend . the observer being an avaricious old sexton who was anxious to know what fees he should receive in the following year . this worthy , on all souls night , stationed himself in the sacred building . and counted the spirits he saw enter and walk about . until he observed a double of himself .
`` dear me , '' sighed prince [male] . for even a prince 's legs are not very long when he is only ten years old . and it is not pleasant to have to climb an iceberg at the end of a long walk . there was no help for it , however , for there was the iceberg waiting to be climbed . so the little prince went straight at it as bravely as he could .
the first to make his appearance was the bear , who took a long and steady draught . then came the deer , the [male] , and such others of the family as are noted for their comfortable case . the moose and bison were slack in their cups . and the partridge , always lean in flesh , looked on till the supply was nearly gone . there was not a drop left by the time the [male] and the [male] appeared on the shore of the lake .
`` you should not stare so hard at me , '' said the soldier . `` you might strain your eyes , '' and he set the dog upon the witch 's apron . and when he saw the silver money in the chest . he threw away all the copper money he had and filled his pockets and his knapsack with silver only . then he went into the third chamber , oh , but that was horrid , the dog there really had eyes as big as towers .
mirth increased , and the hall was filled with peals of laughter . but , on a sudden , a herald , pale and breathless . rushed into the midst of the company , and told them that [male] . a savage giant with two heads . had heard of the death of his two kinsmen , and was come to take his revenge on [male] .

bog prostit equal god will forgive . this sounds to the english ear like an ungracious reply , but it is the phrase ordinarily used by a superior when an inferior asks his pardon . before taking the sacrament at easter , the servants in a russian household ask their employers to forgive them for any faults of which they may have been guilty . `` god will forgive , '' is the proper reply , some of these have been compared by mr. [male] . in his `` mythology of the aryan nations , '' i . 135 142 .
the irish phooka , in its nature , perfectly resembles the mahr . and we have only to observe , that there is a particular german tradition of a spirit . which sits among reeds and alder bushes . and which , like the phooka , leaps upon the back of those who pass by in the night . and does not leave them till they faint and fall to the earth .
a couple of hours later the landlord . who was the first to leave his pillow , got up and washed , when he took up the towel to dry himself . he scratched his face and made a long red line from ear to ear . then he went to the kitchen to light his pipe . but when he stooped over the hearth the egg shells flew into his eye .
so [female] the fisherman put on the ring . and then went his way about his own business , that night . as he came home carrying his nets over his shoulder . whom should he meet but the little old man in gray , with the white beard and the black cap on his head and the long staff in his hand . `` is your name [male] ? '' said the little man .
when her deadened imagination again began to stir , she fancied that she was struggling with a huge crab . which was cutting her foot with shears , the little elf was urging it on . as the huntsmen cheer the hounds , the pain and hate she felt would have been intolerable if [male] had made common cause with the terrible child . but he reproved her conduct . and even struggled with the kobold who tried to prevent his releasing her from the crab .
you know i wish you all imaginable happiness . yes , i am sure of it , you must be surprised -- very much surprised . so lately as mr. [male] was wishing to marry you . but , dear [male] , when you have had time to think it all over . i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done , i am not romantic .
`` nothing is more real , madam , '' the fairy replied . and at that moment the door of the castle opened and six other fairies came out . but what fairies , they were the most beautiful ever seen , they all made a low bow to the queen . and each one presented her with a branch flowering with petals of precious stones . to make herself a bouquet , one bore roses .
the old fairy led her to a pretty room which she said should be hers . at the same time giving her the strictest orders never to let out the fire which was burning brightly in the grate . she then gave two glass bottles into the princess 's charge . desiring her to take the greatest care of them , and having enforced her orders with the most awful threats in case of disobedience . she vanished , leaving the little girl at liberty to explore the palace and grounds and a good deal relieved at having only two apparently easy tasks set her .
at cabul she and [female] saw each other . and they fell in love , with all the ardour of their nation . as a love token the princess gave him the diamond . and , at parting , [female] promised to go to see her secretly in cashmere . the young [male] had two favourite attendants who served him as secretaries .
the torn clouds hung in fantastic shapes among the tree clad mountains . and over the rushing rhone ; they hung in shapes like antediluvian monsters . like eagles hovering in the air and like frogs leaping in a pool . they came down over the rapid stream , they sailed over it although they sailed in the air . the river bore on its surface a pine tree torn up by the roots .
with a glad heart the young man thanked the dervish . and paid such close heed to his directions that , a few days later . a strange figure covered with soft feathers walked into the presence of the sultan . the princess 's father was filled with surprise . for never had he seen such a sight before , oh , how lovely were those little bodies .
then they sat down together under a shady tree , and the prince inquired . what have you been doing all this time ? where have you been ? who is this lady ? and how did you get all these attendants ? somadatta , thus questioned , began the recital of what he had done and seen . my lord , having great anxiety on your account .
stone cooking in the gardens is done in a slightly different way . there they dig in the ground a round hole about one foot deep and from one 1/2 to two feet in diameter . and in this hole they make their fire . on which they pile their stones ; and the rest of the process is the same as before . this hole making process is never adopted in the village , the only reason for it which was suggested was that the method was quicker .
winter closed her visits ; but young [female] was as patient as the earth . and did not begin to look for her till [male] , as surely as it brought leaves to the trees and flowers to the grass . it would , he knew , bring his little [male] 's question . half shy , half smiling . `` is your cherry tree in [female] , shepherd ? '' and later her request .
saying this , he placed himself in the chair with the cat upon his knee . for nobody saw him , because he had his little red cap on . finding [male] 's plate well supplied with partridge . quails , and pheasants , he made so free with them that whatever was set before master [male] disappeared in a trice . the whole court said no cat ever ate with a better appetite .
the king and the court occupied the grand stand . the princess being in the front row . the public took the rest of the seats , and the heralds announced that the jousts were about to commence . [male] appeared in the foreground upon a beautiful black horse . large black plumes waved over the crest of his helmet .
`` do as you are bid , slave , '' cried the sprite angrily , giving the boy a violent kick in the side . hitherto he had contrived to keep his limbs out of the prince 's sight . but [male] had now the opportunity of observing that his tormentor 's foot was the size of that of a full grown man . the prince spoke these words in a tone of resolute determination . and the sprite seemed to hesitate for a moment what he would do .
among foreign nations , con mór and his good queen eda reigned in great glory during many years . they were blessed with an only son , whom they named [male] . after both his parents , because the druids foretold at his birth that he would inherit the good qualities of both . according as the young prince grew in years , his amiable and benignant qualities of mind . as well as his great strength of body and manly bearing .
i shall never forget his solemn countenance . and the deep tones of his warning voice . when he concluded his tale , by telling me . that the next day after his ride with the fairies . [male] dowling was missing , and he believed him to be given to the sarpint in his place .
there was a race the next day , and the blind [male] took the sky born snorter to the race course . and started him with the other horses , the other horses trotted away round the course . but the sky born snorter stayed just where he was , and rocked : and when the other horses came round the turn . there he was waiting for them at the judge 's stand . so he won the race ; and the judge gave the prize .
the prisoner 's bed was placed in the same room with the colonel and the major . all else had vanished ; nothing of the present remained , neither the battles , nor the innumerable corpses . nor that ocean of disasters which for a long time had been rolling its blood stained waves under the major 's eyes . `` sleep , my darling , sleep , my angel , '' he murmurs , making the sign of the cross above her .
one summer , a long , long time ago , the folk of melbustad went up to the hill pastures with their herd . but they had been there only a short time when the cattle began to grow so restless that it was impossible to keep them in order . a number of different [female] tried to manage them . but without avail ; until one came who was betrothed , and whose betrothal had but recently been celebrated . then the cattle suddenly quieted down , and were easy to handle , so the [female] remained alone in the hills with no other company than a dog .
the winter came on with rare beauty , the rain . so long withheld , fell copiously , until the hills were covered with luxurious verdure and gorgeous flowers . [male] heart grew lighter ; he might hope to recover his losses in time . [organization] was laden with fruit , and the lemons fell to the ground from the bending trees . [female] loved the green grass , the fragrant flowers .
the two elder brothers were shouting with joy . but [female] answered no word , they took leave of their father and went together to the edge of the town . where they separated ; the eldest went to the east , the second to the west . but [male] to the mouse hole , which opened quickly to give him a convenient passage . at the white castle the white lady gave him the white steed .
a fine house was built there , with large windows , and smooth white walls . but before it , where the old house had in fact stood . was a little garden laid out , and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the neighboring house . before the garden there was a large iron railing with an iron door . it looked quite splendid , and people stood still and peeped in , and the sparrows hung by scores in the vine .
it was the moment for which the knight of the fish had watched and waited . and before the dragon could find out that he was not hurt at all , the young man 's lance was down his throat . and he was rolling , dead , on the grass , oh , what shouts of joy rang through the great city . when the youth came riding back with the princess sitting behind him . and dragging the horrible monster by a cord , everybody cried out that the king must give the victor the hand of the princess .
once he was tied to the stake , and just going to be scalped by the indians . when some miraculous thing occurred to save him ; once he was in the very coils of an enormous snake . and was yet preserved ; and at another time , he was actually swallowed by a crocodile . ( i am sure i do not know how he got down its throat without a disabling [male] from some of those teeth which i have noticed in the mouths of stuffed crocodiles in museums . ) and escaped by means of employing his penknife in a manner too disagreeable to describe .
in the manufacture of textile fabrics . notably , their famous carpets of yezd and ispahan . and their embroidered cloths in hammered and engraved metal work . and formerly in beautiful pottery and porcelain -- they have excelled . and examples will be found in the south kensington museum .
i can not tell you how long queen [female] . and [female] , [female] , and [female] . her three sons , and [female] , their playfellow . went wandering along the highways and bypaths , or through the pathless wildernesses of the earth . in this manner , but certain it is , that , before they reached any place of rest .
now the duck had been carefully brought up , and did not like dirt , and , besides . broken shells are not at all comfortable things to sit or walk upon ; so she pushed the rest out over the side . and felt delighted to have some company to talk to till the big egg hatched . but day after day went on , and the big egg showed no signs of cracking . and the duck grew more and more impatient , and began to wish to consult her husband .
on this the swordmaker took out and exhibited the andrea ferrara blade . which was exactly like the sword of sharpness , the upholsterer undid his parcel . and there was a persian rug , which no one could tell from the magical carpet . the hatter was fumbling with the string of his parcel . when he suddenly remembered , what the king in his astonishment had not noticed .
[male] now became invested with supreme power , and assigned to his brothers offices of distinction . subordinate only to himself , subsequently , however , when , secure of his position . he no longer needed their assistance , he basely repaid their former services with treachery . made war upon his brothers and faithful allies . and , assisted by the giants , completely defeated them , sending such as resisted his all conquering arm down into the lowest depths of tartarus .
so when the sermon was over , and the king 's daughter was to go out of the church . the prince had got a firkin of pitch poured out in the porch . that he might come and help her over it ; but she did not care a bit . she just put her foot right down into the midst of the pitch . and jumped across it ; but then one of her golden shoes stuck fast in it .
he stood there , and could not take his eyes off her , and all the great captains and courtiers marvelled at her and fell in love with her straightway . but who she was , they knew not , when service was over . she got up and drove away , when she got home . she took off all her fine things , and put on all her rags again . and sat in the window corner and watched the folk coming from church .
she rose to her feet , and with bowed head passed from the cave hall without another word . her heart was very heavy , for at first she could think of no one to whom she could turn for assistance . the shadows , without their [male] , were powerless against the wizard . all others in the land were not only as wicked as he . as she well knew , but every one of them , curling smoke .
almost immediately a rushing hissing sound was heard in the waters . the waves dashed against the banks , the foam was tossed into the air . and the two horses leapt suddenly on to the dry land , [person] and shaking with fear . [person] sprang at once on to the mare 's back . seized the foal by its bridle , and hastened home in the highest spirits .
the fairy laughed , and spread her dazzling wings glistening with all the glories of the higher mathematics . [female] closed dazzled eyes , and opened them as the desk lid shut down on his head . swayed by no uncertain hand , it was the mathematical master 's hand , in fact . a new example was set , and , curiously enough , white rabbits were in it . when he returned , with his books in a strap .
at once the bear turned on his heel and went down the trail . as fast as he could go , never again did the woman hear that strange thump . thump , thump ; and never again did the bear call to see if she were at home . once upon a time , the great spirit left the happy hunting ground and came to earth . he took the form of a poor , hungry man .
at this awful sight i shrieked aloud in my grief and pain . i threw myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hair with sorrow . then , fearing to be punished as his murderer by the unhappy father , i raised the great stone which blocked the staircase . and quitting the underground chamber , made everything fast as before , scarcely had i finished when . looking out to sea , i saw the vessel heading for the island , and , feeling that it would be useless for me to protest my innocence .
so perfectly like other people had she been in the water . that even yet the prince could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw her ascend slowly . grasp the balcony , and disappear through the window , he turned . almost expecting to see her still by his side , but he was alone in the water . so he swam away quietly , and watched the lights roving about the shore for hours after the princess was safe in her chamber .
david grew fast and was strong , for his life in the woodlands was one to make any boy well and happy . he learned his father 's trade . and in a short time , although he was not nearly full grown . he could wield an axe as well as many a grown man . in fact , he could put some men to shame .
such was my father 's story , i assured him that i sincerely repented of my behavior towards the good little man . and he remitted the other half of the punishment which he had intended for me . to my comrades i told the wonderful history of the dwarf . and we conceived such an affection for him . that no one insulted him any more , on the contrary , we honored him as long as he lived .
the wedding festivities lasted a whole month . [male] and his princess loved each other dearly , and the old king lived to see many a happy day . when he took their little children on his knees and let them play with his sceptre . and [male] became king over the whole country . on one of the danish islands , where old thingstones , the seats of justice of our forefathers .
you doom my banishment from love and all unmoved remain . you [female] my wounded lids of rest and sleep whilst i complain . you make mine eyes familiar with watching and unrest ; yet can my heart forget you not . nor eyes from tears refrain , you swore to me that you would keep . for aye , your plighted faith ; but when my heart was yours .
everyone else was convinced that the boy was drowned , but she could not bring herself to believe this . she searched all the while , she searched between reeds and bulrushes . tramped and tramped on the muddy shore , never thinking of how deep her foot sank . and how wet she had become , she was unspeakably desperate , her heart ached in her breast . she did not weep , but wrung her hands and called for her child in loud piercing tones .
the wife was as pious as her husband and never failed to obey his commands . so she made a big milk pudding , and she boiled vegetables and stewed fruits . but just as she had finished and was about to invite her husband and his brahman guests to begin their feast . the dog saw that a snake had entered the grain jar . which had not been properly shut , and that it had left its poisonous trail all over the grain from which the milk pudding had been prepared .
she was gifted with wonderful beauty , and was tenderly loved by [female] . but her lot was far from being a happy one , for [female] , being extremely jealous of her . persecuted her with inveterate cruelty . and sent the dreadful serpent python to terrify and torment her wherever she went . but [female] , who had observed with the deepest compassion her weary wanderings and agonized fears .
he then threw a bucket of water into his wife 's face . and , having revived her , said , give me quickly my seven league boots . that i may go after those boys and catch them . he then started out into the country at once , and , having rushed about in all directions . came at last to the road where the poor children were walking , and then not more than a hundred steps from their father 's house .
the sun was beating fiercely on the desert , and the sands were almost as hot as burning cinders . and as [male] advanced over them his body became dried up . and his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth . and when his thirst was at its height a fountain of sparkling water sprang up in the burning plain a few paces in front of him . but when he came up quite close to it and stretched out his parched hands to cool them in the limpid waters .
the water , however , began gradually first to wet her feather bed . then her mattress , and [male] began to feel uncomfortable , and turned from side to side . and then [male] woke up , he had a capital nose . and when he smelt the soles and cod fish so near , he started barking at them . and this awoke all the other fish , who began swimming about , the bigger ones ran against the princess 's bed .
the next thing we have to account for is the bed of shale or hardened clay covering over the coal . now we know that from time to time land has gone slowly up and down on our globe so as in some places to carry the dry ground under the sea . and in others to raise the sea bed above the water , let [location] suppose . then , that the great dismal swamp was gradually to sink down so that the sea washed over it and killed the reeds and shrubs . then the streams from the west would not be sifted any longer but would bring down mud .
only , the frost settles on them sometimes . and the drops of rain leave marks on them . ` i can easily clean them inside , i said . ` but how am i to get the frost and rain off the outside of them ? ', ` oh ! he said , ` it 's quite easy , there are ladders all about .
after the dance was at an end she managed to slip out . so slyly that the king did not see where she was gone ; but she sprang into her little cabin . and made herself into cat skin again , and went into the kitchen to cook the soup . whilst the cook was above stairs , she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the soup . then it was brought to the king , who ate it .
the night came on , coach after coach rolled up to the diamond door . which sparkled in the moonlight , when the guests had all arrived , a silver trumpet sounded . and aunt [female] , dressed in a wonderful gown of flowering brocade edged with pearls . came solemnly down the great stairway of the castle hall . two little black boys , dressed in oriental costume and wearing turbans .
at last they passed through the wood , and they found themselves on a green plain . speckled with flowers , and they had not gone far when the prince saw coming towards him a hundred champions on [male] steeds . and around the breast of the steeds were crescents of gold . from which were hanging little golden bells , the warriors all wore golden helmets . and the shafts of their shining spears were of gold .
the forest leaves became more and more yellow , leaf fell down upon leaf , and the stormy winds of autumn howled . the year was far advanced , and the queen of the year reclined upon the fallen yellow leaves . and looked with mild eyes at the gleaming star , and her husband stood by her . a gust swept through the leaves ; they fell again in a shower . and the queen was gone , but a butterfly , the last of the season .
from what we have shown , on the authority of authentic documents . we understand how [person] is the tradition . or rather the popular idea , that the secret tribunal was an assembly of bloodthirsty judges . secretly perpetrating acts of mere cruelty , without any but arbitrary laws . it is clear , on the contrary , that it was a regular institution .
what happened to him when he got there will be told in another story . now of all the men gathered together at the thing of the year 974 . no man was handsomer or more splendidly clad than [male] , he was arrayed in the scarlet raiment given him by king [male] . and he bore on his arm a gold ring . given him by [male] the [male] .
he rose , and to his great dismay he found the fire was out . it was a sign that he had slept and this would disgrace him . he could not start the fire anew because the flint and steel were in the pockets of the other brothers . he ran to the top of the neighboring hill . whence he saw a light gleaming at a distance .
the princess herself led the child into the room where the twenty men were now seated . she stood in the centre of the ring for a moment . looking at one man after another , and then held out the apple to the shifty lad . who was twisting a shaving of wood round his finger . and had the mouthpiece of a bagpipe hanging from his neck .
but although she sang it over and over again , as if her heart would burst . he neither listened nor stirred , for the old washerwoman 's potion had made sure of that . next morning , in her great trouble , the little princess broke open the pear . hoping that its contents would help her better than the contents of the apple had done . but in it she found just what she had found before .
`` to hear is to obey , '' said the genie , as he spoke he smote his hands together . and instantly there appeared twenty musicians , dressed in cloth of gold and silver . with them they brought hautboys and fiddles . big and little , and flageolets and drums and horns . and this and that to make music with , again the genie smote his hands together .
and many a night he had to sleep under the open sky . wet through with the driving rain or the falling mist ; but his good humor never forsook him . the drum sticks sounded , `` rub a dub , all up , all up , '' yes , he was certainly born to be a drummer . life and limb were lost in the battle . bombshells tore away the flesh in red strips .
`` this fish bites at the bait , '' said the damsel to herself . `` but it is not yet surely caught. '' but even while she spoke , she herself . foolish [female] that she was , was caught herself . for , as a fisher who , while he seeks for the prey . falls into the brook , so clarin , seeking to serve her [female] 's ends .
presently he heard faint sounds of music in the air . looking up in the direction they came from , he saw floating a small object . like a little summer cloud that approaches down from above the earth . at first it was very small , and seemed as if it could have been blown away by the first breeze that came along . but it rapidly grew as he gazed upon it .
small as the boy was , he was obliged to take care of the goats . and if he who can climb with them is a good guardian . well then indeed was [male] , why he climbed even higher than they ! he loved to take the bird 's nests from the trees . high in the air , for he was bold and daring .
but she did not hold him , [male] had been in a policeman 's hands many a time . and out of them too , what is more ; and he would have been ashamed to face his friends for ever if he had been stupid enough to be caught by an old woman . so he doubled under the good lady 's arm . across the room , and out of the window in a moment . but all under the window spread a tree , with great leaves and sweet white flowers .
they ascended these steps with all possible haste up into the open . where the blue sky was above them . and where they could breathe freely the air that never before had seemed so sweet and pure . looking around they could note the ravages of the flood . for with it there had come a mighty tidal wave from the sea .
and in his hands he held a harp of gold . and struck it with a golden key ; and as he struck . he sang till his eyes glittered , and filled all the cave with light . and he sang of the birth of time . and of the heavens and the dancing stars .
her own shadow disappeared through the crack in the door . and returned immediately , followed by another , i started , and almost cried out . it was the shadow of a young girl . undoubtedly the princess , and it stood upright on the floor beside the other . she paced about , growing more and more excited , and went on talking as she walked .
the fall of [organization] closed the way to the political independence of the western slavs . after them , there remained in the whole slav world but the poles and the russians with the possibility of political power . i regret my inability to include polish myth tales in this collection . owing to want of space , should the present volume meet with favor . it will be followed during the coming year by another , in which a good deal of attention will be given the poles .
when the prince and his bride reached the court . all were bound to acknowledge that the princess was by far the loveliest lady they had ever seen . so the poor old king felt that now he would be obliged to give up his kingdom . but the princess knelt by his side . kissed his hand gently , and told him that there was no reason for him to cease ruling .
at last they agreed on the price , and [male] laid the knapsack on him . and so he walked a bit , and rode a bit . turn and turn about , at night he came to a green plain where stood a great tree . at the roots of which he sat down , there he let the horse loose . but he did not lie down to sleep , but opened his knapsack and took a meal .
the figure now approached the bed , seeming to grow exhausted and malignant as it did so . my uncle 's terror nearly culminated at this point . for he believed it was drawing near him with an evil purpose . but it was not so ; for the soldier , over whom twenty years seemed to have passed in his brief transit to the dressing table and back again . threw himself into a great high backed arm chair of stuffed leather at the far side of the fire .
[female] needed nothing more ; he pounced upon his saddle and bridle . slung them upon his mustang , and had everything snug in less time than it takes to tell it . the rest of the party were far too comfortable to co operate with [male] to any considerable extent . we contented ourselves with making a show of examining our weapons . all this time the wolves , as is their way when attracted by firelight .
the better the japanese people come to be known and understood , the more , i am certain . will it be felt that a great injustice has been done them in the sweeping attacks which have been made upon their women . writers are agreed , i believe , that their matrons are , as a rule , without reproach . if their maidens are chaste , as i contend that from very force of circumstances they can not help being . what becomes of all these charges of vice and immodesty ?
he found also meadows and lanes . islands and lakes , where the birds sang sweeter . and the flowers were more brilliant and fragrant than anything he had ever seen on earth . there was a breeze , and yet one did not feel the wind ; it was quite clear and bright . but there was no heat ; the waves were dashing , still there was no danger .
there was no living thing around them , not a fly . not a moss upon the rocks , neither seal nor sea gull dare come near . lest the ice should [female] them in its claws . the surge broke up in foam , but it fell again in flakes of snow . and it frosted the hair of the three gray sisters .
sinbad stopped here , and ordered the musicians to proceed with their concert . which the story had interrupted , the company continued enjoying themselves till the evening . when [female] sent for a purse of a hundred sequins . and giving it to the porter , said : take this , [male] , return to your home . and come back tomorrow to hear more of my adventures , the porter went away .
these are the ways by which , when i run that tub . i shall escape , i shall make a thermopyla of the corner of one of them . defend it with my cutlass against the coast guard until my brave companions have sheered off . then dive into the darkness , and regain my [person] 's arms . in connection with these breakneck steps i observe some wooden cottages .
this occurred between his espousal and marriage , and the lament composed by his intended bride is still and deservedly a popular song in mull . there seems to be this much truth in the story , that the young man was dragged into loch frisa by a mare which he was attempting to subdue and drowned . it would appear from the song that his body was recovered . the popular details of the incident vary considerably . and are of interest as illustrative of the growth of tales of superstition .
the fairies who live in [female] 's had pulled her in . and carried her to their own home , one time there was a woman named [female] . in close ny lheiy , near [female] , and she had a child that had fallen sick in a strange way . nothing seemed wrong with him , yet crosser and crosser he grew . nying nyanging night and day , the woman was in great distress .
the trees were so thick and the wood so dark , that he paused for a moment and listened . straining his ears to catch some sound to break a silence which almost frightened him . but nothing came , not even the baying of a hound or the note of a horn . he stood still , and wondered if he should go on , when , on looking up . a stream of light seemed to flow from the top of a tall tree .
the fight was fiercer than his first one ; but towards evening . when he was growing faint , the cowboy remembered that if he should fall . neither his father nor mother would see him again . and he would never get the daughter of the king of erin . leaving the body of the giant , the cowboy drove home the cattle .
should he turn back ? but if he did he would have to pass them all . and he remembered with a shudder how his hand had gone right through those bodiless shapes when he had tried to touch them . so it was better to go forward instead of retracing his footsteps , [male] came now to a turn of the path where a great rock jutted out . barring his way in such a fashion that to pass it he would have to put one foot before the other on a ledge so narrow that the sight alone made him feel giddy and faint . beneath him gaped the great sea of clouds covering unknown depths he could not penetrate .
so much for the women ; but the men also were uneasy , they prowled up and down . tramping from the spy hole to the kitchen , and from the kitchen to the turreted roof . and from the roof they would look down on the motionless figure below . and speculate on many things , including the staunchness of man . the qualities of their master , and even the possibility that the new gods might be as powerful as the old .
his name was [male] , but , since he remained such a wee bit of a fellow . they called him little [male] . at home there was but little to eat and nothing at all to burn , so his father went about the country trying to get the boy a place as cowherd or errand boy . but there was no one who would take the weakly little lad till they came to the sheriff . he was ready to take him , for he had just sent off his errand boy .
today old [female] was very tired ; he sat down on a heap of ore . placed his little lamp in a niche of the rock . which was already blackened with smoke , and buried his head in his hands . not a single [male] reached this spot , a melancholy silence reigned in this vault . but the old man was accustomed to it , he for whom the darkness was peopled by mysterious apparitions vanishing as soon as they appeared .
with that he faced the depths of the forest and stood very erect . with hands uplifted , there was a very solemn expression in his eyes . and suddenly it seemed that the nearby trees began to lift and disappear ; and presto ! [male] and his companions were standing quite close to one of the most famous and remarkable houses ever heard of . [male] had too little time just then to marvel at the strange feat which had been performed by the giant .
the butterfly wished for a bride ; and , as may be imagined , he wanted to select a very pretty one from among the flowers . therefore he threw a critical glance at all the flower beds . and found that every flower sat quietly and demurely on her stalk . just as a [female] ought to sit , before she is engaged ; but there were a great many of them . and the choice threatened to become wearisome , the butterfly did not care to take much trouble .
the law of the visigoths speaks of nobles holding local courts . similar to those of the official judge , count , or bishop . king [male] required the public and the private judges to act together . in the law of [male] landlords are mentioned who . in virtue of the double title of nobles and judges .
after having somewhat recovered her surprise , she took up the key . locked the door , and went upstairs into her chamber to recover herself . but she could not , she was so much frightened , having observed that the key of the closet was stained with blood . she tried two or three times to wipe it off . but the blood would not come out ; in vain did she wash it .
as they passed from hall to hall , beauty everywhere showed itself . and as the metal pig went step by step from one picture to the other . the little boy could see it all plainly , one glory eclipsed another . yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy 's memory . more especially because of the happy children it represented , for these the little boy had seen in daylight .
many a one will wonder that [female] changed all at once ; but a beating has brought many a man to new ways . so [male] made ready and went to the castle , in the castle there was not a living soul . [male] took off his coat , tied the sleeves at the wrist . and began to rake gold into them , he had almost finished when he heard noises at a distance like bursts of thunder . these noises grew louder and louder till at last they were so loud that the castle trembled .
any day , from morning till evening in summer . she might be descried -- a streak of white in the blue water . lying as still as the shadow of a cloud , or shooting along like a dolphin . disappearing , and coming up again far off , just where one did not expect her . she would have been in the lake of a night .
when the other youth had brought back the king 's daughter . it was decided to hold the wedding , but the king 's daughter was not willing . and said : he is not the right man , my deliverer will come and bring with him half of the long pin for my hair . and half my silken kerchief as a token . but when the youth did not appear for so long a time , and the other one pressed the king .
one day the merchant 's wife had gone out with one of the boys and the girl and had been absent for half a day . the north wind was blowing briskly , and in the merchant 's heart there awoke a longing for his old home . he took his son by the hand and went down to the sea shore . there his old ship was still lying , so he climbed into it with his boy . and in a day and a night was back in annam again .
in a little lodge at a beautiful spot on a lake shore . alone with his sister , lived a boy remarkable for the smallness of his stature . many large rocks were scattered around their habitation , and it had a very wild and out of the way look . the boy grew no larger as he advanced in years . and yet , small as he was , he had a big spirit of his own .
at that very moment one of the little boys took up the tin soldier . and threw it into the stove , there was no reason for his doing so . it must certainly have been the jack in the box that was the cause of it . the tin soldier stood amid the flames . and felt a great heat , but whether it was actual fire .
she continued thus for nearly two years , during which time she was all but a hermit . she was often visited , it is true , during those solitary years by many admirers . who used all the fair words at their command to press their suit upon her . but she invariably answered that she `` did not yet tire of her widow 's weeds. '' eventually , however , she became gradually more cheerful , and took some pleasure in society .
the number and respectability of the conjuratores varied according to the importance of the case in dispute . [male] of tours relates . that king [male] being suspicious as to the legitimacy of the child who afterwards became clotaire ii. . his mother , [male] , called in the impartial testimony of certain nobles . these , to the number of three hundred , with three bishops at their head .
rejoiced was the farmer when he again heard the notes . and with the earliest dawn he went to the castle and joyfully met the youth . the latter related to him the events of the night . and then descended to his treasure , with which he did as the little old man had commanded him . he caused , however , the old castle to be pulled down , and there soon stood a new one in its place .
persons of a figure remotely reconcilable with his were subjected to quite extraordinary inquisitions . made to [male] their faces before going on board ship . as if each white complexion were made up like a mask , of greasepaint . every negro in [location] was put under special regulations and made to report himself . the outgoing ships would no more have taken a nigger than a basilisk , for people had found out how fearful and vast and silent was the force of the savage secret society .
from that little village on the palatine hill . founded some 750 years b.c. , rome had spread and conquered in every direction . until in the time of [female] she was [female] of the whole civilised world . herself the centre of wealth . civilisation , luxury , and power .
for the time being the upset concerning the luggage and the consequent hurry had caused both the new-comers to forget all about their fellow visitor . and it was with no preoccupation of mind concerning her that [female] and [female] . escorted by annot , made their way down the long room . to where at the end the members of the family group . whose greetings they had already received , were awaiting them .
then we there sat down , each of [location] on a chair of gold . there was laid out for [location] abundance of food and drinking horns filled with beer . when we had taken a sufficiency of food and much sweet drinking wines . then spoke the mild young princess , and thus said she , `` hearken to me awhile .

romance , with moonflower face and morning eyes . and lips whose thread of scarlet prophesies the canticles of a coming king unknown . remember , when you join him on his throne . even me , your far off troubadour , and wear for me some trifling rose beneath your veil . dying a royal death , happy and pale , choked by the passion , the wonder and the snare .
when the eleven had grown up to be men they decided to go out into the world to try their fortune . and they plagued their father to give them what they required for the journey . the father was not much in favour of this , for he was now old and weak . and could not well spare them from helping him with his work . but in the long run he had to give in , each one of the eleven got a fine white horse and money for the journey .

now the queen once traveled through the land , and she had her little daughter with her . and this little daughter was a princess , and people streamed to the castle . and [female] was there also , and the little princess stood in her fine white dress . in a window , and let herself be stared at ; she had neither a train nor a golden crown . but splendid red [location] shoes , they were certainly far handsomer than those [female] shoemaker had made for little [female] .
somewhat assured by the impunity with which he had already explored the enchanted districts . he was beginning to pick his way with freer breath . when his ears were smitten by a sound which sank his heart still deeper . it was the loud and furious barking of a pack of evidently most ferocious dogs . which approached rapidly , right in his path , on came the savage animals .
on both these vessels the men were so distressed that they gathered on the bulwarks . pointing to their empty mouths and their ragged clothing , the officers of the golden hind were unwilling to return . but consented on sir [male] 's promise that they should come back in the spring . they sailed for england on the 31st of august . all wished him to return in the golden hind as a much larger and safer vessel .
the fifty one stories which i have translated at length i have rendered as literally as possible . in the very rare instances in which i have found it necessary to insert any words by way of explanation . i have ( except in the case of such additions as `` he said '' or the like ) enclosed them between brackets , in giving summaries . also , i have kept closely to the text , and always translated literally the passages marked as quotations .
he was given to drink and idling , when he had run through all his money . his relatives cast him out , one winter day he was walking barefoot about the city . with an empty stomach and torn clothes , evening came on and still he had not found any food . without end or aim he wandered about the market place . he was hungry , and the cold seemed well nigh unendurable , so he turned his eyes upward and began to lament aloud .
but all the while he was talking the [male] 's head was spinning and spinning . and buzzing and buzzing , so that he hardly heard a word of what the king said . then when the king had ended his speech , the lords and gentlemen who had brought the [male] in led him forth again . out they went through room after room . out through the courtyard , out through the gate , bang ! .
in his heart the poet knew that it had not been the moonlight . but that nature had granted him one of those mystic visitations which come only to those whose loving meditation upon her secrets have opened the hidden doors . she had drawn aside for a moment the veil of her visible beauty . and vouchsafed him a glimpse of her invisible mystery . but the veil had been drawn again almost instantly , and the poet 's eyes were left empty and hungered for the face that had thus momentarily looked at him through the veil .
`` here i am , '' said the prince from the top of the hill . then the flat , white head set itself against the edge of the chink from which it had peeped . and slowly , like the movement of a sheet of ice . it slipped upwards and curled upwards . and up , and up , there seemed no end to it at all ; and it moved horribly .
lower down the stream a princess was bathing and when she saw the packet come floating down . she had it fished out , and when she opened it she saw the hairs inside and she measured them and found them to be twelve fathoms long . then the princess vowed that she would not eat rice . till she found the man to whom the hairs belonged . and she went home and shut herself in her room and refused to eat .
they placed two weaving looms , and began to do as if they were working . but they had not the least thing on the looms . they also demanded the finest silk and the best gold . which they put in their pockets , and worked at the empty looms till late into the night . both the impostors begged him to be so kind as to step closer .
`` no , sweet friend , i will never leave you ! '' cried [male] , vainly endeavoring to restrain his furious steed ; for , worse than before . it now began to foam and rear with excitement , until at last the knight was glad to keep the animal at a sufficient distance from the exhausted [female] lest her fears should be increased . but scarcely had he withdrawn a few paces with the wild steed . than she began to call after him in the most pitiful manner .
i humbly beg your majesty , therefore , proceeded he . to take some notice of what i now represent to you . i am sensible your majesty 's company is a great comfort to the prince in his condition . and that his is no less assuaging to your grief ; but then you must not run the risk of letting all be lost . i should think it were proper to be proposed to your majesty .
passing through this she travelled through a valley covered with trees . passing through this at last she saw the great alpine fir trees at the end of the vale . there she found a clear spring ; in her parching thirst she stooped to drink . but in her hurry she lost her balance and fell into the water . as she tried to drag herself out with her two stumps .
he immediately summoned all the best doctors in the country . and they came with all their prescriptions and their medicine bottles . but next day the princess was stiff and cold in death . all the doctors could certify to that and they all put their names to this and appended their seals . and then they had done all they could , the king kept his promise .
`` yes , i will , '' said the prince , for he saw the red silk thread on the old woman 's finger . at this the witch became so furious that she danced about and knocked everything to pieces that she could lay her hands upon . so that the splinters flew about the ears of the prince and princess . who now stood there in her own beautiful shape , then their marriage had to be celebrated . for the witch had to stick to what she had promised , and he must get the princess whatever might happen afterwards .
as soon as the people saw the holy woman , as they imagined him to be . they presently gathered about him in a great crowd . some begged his blessing , others kissed his hand . and others , more reserved , only the hem of his garment . while others , suffering from disease , stooped for him to lay his hands upon them .
they might have lived together always had it not been for the slyness and greediness of the fox . who tried to over reach his companion , who was not nearly so clever as he was . it chanced , one dark december night . that there was a dreadful storm at sea , and in the morning the beach was all strewn with wreckage . so as soon as it was daylight the two friends went down to the shore to see if they could find anything to eat .
my dear child , what a silly notion , do not you know that no one ever marries in a fairy tale . under the rank of a prince or a princess ? oh , you may see him any clear night in july . for the old dog star was so worn out by the last three hot summers that there have been no dog days since . so that they had to take him down and put [male] 's dog up in his place .
[female] at the citadel a few hours after [female] 's escape . and was informed by her attendants that she had also accompanied him in his flight . upon which the enraged sultan , hurried on by fate . without stopping to search the palace in which his daughter was concealed , hastened to join his troops on the banks of the lake . and with a vast army pursued the sindian prince , who , however , reached his capital in safety .
the king , who passed by a minute afterwards . wished to know to whom belonged all the cornfields he saw , `` to my lord the marquis of carabas , '' repeated the reapers , and the king again congratulated the marquis on his property . the cat , still continuing to run before the coach , uttered the same threat to everyone he met . and the king was astonished at the great wealth of my lord the marquis of carabas .
martin : dear [female] , i thank you in charity 's name for being that for me which i have never yet succeeded in being for myself . [female] : what , are you not ashamed to offer [location] a broken gift ? your story is like a cracked pitcher with half the milk leaked out . what was the secret of the lantern , the cloak . and the cherry tree ? [male] : who was the lovely lady , his mother ?
in vain he looked around for some means of escape . there was none , his cap could tell him nothing . he beat upon the doors , but his strength soon failed him . and he fell down in a stupor , how long he lay there he did not know . but when he awoke at length a faint light was shining into the room from a small iron grating close up to the ceiling .
if you watch that pretty flower , and listen , you can hear this strange performance . this is why it does so , the little calyx holds the petals in such a way that the moment it turns back they are let loose . at once it bursts out into full flower , with this funny noise . like a pop gun , so the `` night blooming cereus '' [person] in the night . only for an hour , giving out its sweet fragrance , and then dies .
there was a perfectly beautiful bed , all trimmed with gold and silver lace . so it is said , and on it reposed a slight , queen like young lady . fully dressed , yet sound asleep , her cheeks were delicately tinted , indicating perfect health . her lips were slightly parted ; her bosom rose and fell tranquilly , a naked little [female] knelt on her pillow . his wings aloft , his eyes intently inspecting her closed eyelids .
in highland poetry there is more light than shadow . much symbolism , but no vagueness ; pictures are presented in minute detail . stanzas are cunningly wrought in a spirit of keen artistry ; and the literary style is direct and clear and comprehensible . in highland folklore we find associated with the haunting `` fear of things invisible , '' common to all peoples in early stages of development .
a curator participated as guide by special arrangement . a local celebrity accompanied him ; he stood for the faith of ophir . and smote the egyptologist adversary not once nor twice alone , he confessed to the ladies of the party his conviction that the theory of an african origin was too inconceivably squalid . he stood for the gorgeous east , he said . as against kaffirdom , he would not insult the culture that they brought with them by bothering them with detailed arguments .
so [female] got down and filled a skin with water . and they drew it up by a rope and drank . when they had done drinking , [female] , who was standing in the middle of the stream . called out : throw me the rope and draw me up . for i can not get out alone , and the brothers threw him a rope to draw him up the steep bank .
so by and by he went back to the pier and caught one while the twins played in the sand . he put it in the lunch basket to carry home . [male] brought shells and pebbles to [male] . because he had to stay covered up in the sand , and [male] built a play dyke all around himself with them . and [male] dug a canal outside the dyke , then she made sand pies in clam shells and set them in a row in the sun to bake .
there was once upon a time a little lad , who was on his way to church . and when he came to a clearing in the forest he caught sight of a fox . that was lying on the top of a big stone so fast asleep that he did not know the lad had seen him . but the lad screamed so loudly that the fox woke up and made off at once for the forest . so that the lad did not even get as much as a handful of his hair , no .
just like you , ha , ha ! you said the monkey was just like you . i think you must be a little monkey yourself if it looked just like you . now i will tell you something else , i will say one and then you must say two . i will say three , and you must say four and so on ; but each time we must say after the number a dead horse. ', like this . i say one a dead horse , and you must say two a dead horse .
all this time [female] and the lassies sat by and listened . it was dull work for [male] . he knew little norse , and so could not follow the stories ; sometimes he stared in a dull vacant way at the girls . and sometimes he consulted bradshaw 's foreign guide . whether he solved any of the many mysteries of that most mysterious volume .
the ivy heard these envious words , and they made her very sad . but she said nothing of them to the oak tree . and that night the oak tree rocked her to sleep as he repeated the lullaby a [male] was singing to him . `` i have no fear , '' murmured the ivy . and she clasped her arms most closely about him and nestled unto his bosom .
but to leave antediluvian stories for the freshest news from fairy land . i can not resist the temptation to send you an account of king [male] 's court . which was verified before me as a magistrate , with all the solemnities of a court of justice . within this fortnight past , a young shepherd , a lad of about eighteen years of age . well brought up , and of good capacity , and , that i may be perfectly accurate .
julius stretched himself on the moss , and slept . the next morning he did not waken until it was late . and then he felt himself so wonderfully light that he fancied he must be able to jump as high as the heavens . in order to try his strength , he made a spring . intending to clear a little ant heap which he mistook for a hill ; but he fell in the midst of it .
it seems as if he were destined to arrive at an evil hour . a banquet was held at the emperor 's court . and all sorts of splendid ceremonies were arranged , all through the land went the news that the monarch 's sons . [male] and costan , had brought the water from the fairy [male] . the emperor washed his eyes with the water and saw as never mortal man had seen before .
spin , wheel , spin ; sing . wheel , sing ; every branch on the tree . spin , spin , spin ; the wool is hers . the thread is fine ; for loss of my heart 's blood i will never dwine . her name is [organization] and curr and carr .
my father , who had observed the very moment of my birth . consulted astrologers about my nativity , who told him . your son shall live very happy till the age of fifteen , when he will be in danger of losing his life . and hardly be able to escape it ; but if his good destiny preserve him beyond that time . he will live to grow very old , it will be then , said they .
now there was a long , pretty stretch of water , near which lived a handsome lad . who loved nothing better than to go out on moonlight nights and see the fairies dance . or listen to their music , this youth fell in love with one of these fairies . whose beauty was great beyond description , at last , unable to control his passion . he rushed into the midst of the fairy company .
in fact , it was then most religiously believed that , by despising and holding the jewish nation under the yoke . banished as it was from judaa for the murder of [female] . the will of the almighty was being carried out , so much so that the greater number of kings and princes looked upon themselves as absolute masters over the jews who lived under their [male] . all feudal lords spoke with scorn of their jews . they allowed them to establish themselves on their lands .
she would also remember at times the applause of the multitude . the well-known [female] , her former employer , had besought him to win her back to his company . complaining loudly of her loss , because it was difficult to replace her with an equally skilful young artist . it was now evident how mistaken the juggler had been when he asserted that [male] . who was born among vagrants , would never live in a respectable family , he , [female] .
the weather cock at once sang the chorus and the jackarandajam danced as before , o cock a doodle doo ! the weather will be fine -- if there is no fog , or drenching rain . and thunder does not boom again , and the sun looks out to shine , his prophesies got all mixed and mulled . the moon began to blink ; and all his faculties were dulled when he saw the dog star wink ! and up on the steeple tall and black the weather cock he crew !
so [male] kept his eyes fixed on the bird . he knew well what the great creature wanted ; therefore he stood in readiness to discharge his gun at the proper moment . suddenly the chamois made a spring , and his uncle fired and struck the animal with the deadly bullet . while the young kid rushed away , as if for a long life he had been accustomed to danger and practised flight . the large bird , alarmed at the report of the gun .
then sir [male] began to tremble greatly , for he knew his time had come . he then kneeled before the table and prayed . and suddenly his soul departed and a great company of angels bore his soul up to heaven . and his two friends saw a hand take the holy vessel and bear it up to heaven . since then no man has ever been so bold as to say that he had seen the holy grail .
`` i will sleep before i eat , '' he said . but you can open my wallet , my little men . and make your meal out of it , saying this , he stretched himself out . and in a few minutes [male] and [male] and the lad [male] heard the same sounds as kept them awake the night before . sounds that were like forests moaning and cataracts falling , it was [male] 's snoring .
in the night she told a story . in the night and all night through , while the moon was in her glory . and the branches dropped with dew , in the night i saw her weaving by the misty moonbeam cold . all the weft her shuttle cleaving with a sacred thread of gold , ah ! she wept me tears of sorrow .
and now the wind came at him in great gusts . first came the great boom of the sea , and then a blast of air . the way twisted and circled , making his head giddy for a fall . his feet slipped on the steepness and slime of the descent . and at each turn the sound grew more appalling , and the driving force of the wind more and more like the stroke of a man 's fist .
as it fell [female] made a leap for it and tapped it with her paws—but no sooner was her little white foot inside the slipper then she began to wave her tail violently . she too had the magic gift of the dwarfs ! `` i believe you know , '' cried [male] , as he followed her down the garden walks . `` i believe you know where the waxen image is melting ! '' [female] took the slipper from [female] and she ran ahead swiftly and quietly .
then the little bird grew angry , and began to transform herself into various shapes . in order to terrify the man , that he might open the doors and windows . and be glad that she should fly away , so she became in succession a [female] and lion . an otter , a snake , a scorpion . a tarantula , and at last a frightful dragon , which flew upon the man with poisonous tongue .
for four days of the precious week , however , the poor prince was kept so busy baking and making pastries for the coming of the bride that he did not have an instant to ask questions or do anything else . in the morning hours of the fifth day there was a terrible moaning and roaring outside . and the cooks rushed to the kitchen windows , an unhappy fishing boat had been swept by the wind too near [male] 's castle . the enchanted whirlpool had formed , and caught the boat in its awful circle . now it went slowly round the outer edge .
soon , however , we had much greater cause for alarm . as the genius , having shaken off the princess , flew towards us . our fate would have been sealed if the princess , seeing our danger . had not attracted the attention of the genius to herself , as it was . the sultan 's beard was singed and his face scorched .
thereupon their attendants came and brought them new apparel . as much as they could wear , that had been made ready against the wedding morn . but , amidst of them that rejoiced , the king was heavy of his cheer beneath his crown that day . according to the good custom of the land , [male] and [male] tarried not longer . but went to the minster to hear mass , thither also went [male] .
she heaved a sigh and wiped her eye and ran o'er hill and [female] , oh . and tried what she could as a shepherdess should , to tack to each sheep its tail , oh . but the very first sheep she came to refused to allow her to sew on the tail . and ran away from her , and the others did the same , so that finally she was utterly discouraged . she was beginning to cry again , when the same old woman she had before met came hobbling to her side and asked .
at last he arrived at the fire , and found there were twenty-four robbers round a huge wood fire roasting a bullock . but he was afraid to go near , so he stuck a piece of tinder on the end of his arrow . and shot it through the flames , fortunately the tinder caught fire . but as he went to look for it the dry leaves crackled under his feet . and the robbers seized him , some of the robbers belonged to his father 's kingdom .
the king sprang up gladly , and [male] and his friends set out . they passed stony banks and narrow gullies . the haunts of goblins , suddenly they saw a clump of gloomy trees . overhanging a dreary pool , a shudder ran through them . for the pool was blood red , all sat down by the edge of the pool .
' oh , he did it by your orders , said the chancellor ; then i ll be revenged on you too , and he began to move uncomfortably near to the princess , but the three pages threw themselves on him and tried to drag him back . but he turned suddenly on them , no sooner said than done . and the three pages instantly became water rats , squattering in the water that was still in a pool on the floor .
the prince had no wish to take such an insignificant bundle with him . but he did not like to hurt [male] 's feelings by refusing it . so he took up the little packet , put it in his pocket . and bade the little toad farewell , [male] watched the prince till he was out of sight and then crept back into the water . the further the prince went the more he noticed that the pocket in which the little roll of linen lay became heavier .
one of the host am i of lovers sad and sere for waiting long drawn out and expectation drear . my [person] underneath the loss of friends and folk with pallor 's sorry garb hath clad me , comrades dear . abasement , [person] and heart break after those i suffer who endured before me many a year . all through the day its light and when the night grows dark . my grief forsakes me not .
so he blew , blew , blew , saying . `` sister , will that do ? '' but she shook her head . and then he lost his wits , for he stretched and puffed again till he cracked beneath the strain . and burst , and flew about in little bits , the grasshopper . singing all summer long , now found winter stinging .
mrs. [female] walked away , thinking about how little she really knew about trolls . [female] got up from the table and took his tray over to the window in the wall . looking inside , he saw that there was someone to take the trays and wash the plates and forks and spoons . leaving his tray , he went out the door to the playground to find [female] . by the time mrs. [female] came out to the playground to call her class .
when they had traveled a bit on the way they said they would not take [male] with them . for he was good for nothing , [male] must stop behind . there was no help for it , he did not know what he should do or which way he should turn . he became so sad that he got off the horse and sat down on the grass and began to cry . when he had sat a while one of the tussocks among the grass began to move .
[person] : i said so , i said so ! i know i was right , i should like to tell , them so . [person] : were you only able to go out of the orchard . you would be free to tell -- them so , they are such fools , these men . [person] : not in all matters , master [person] .
the hitherto hermit like [male] felt impelled to try and elicit again those silvery peals of laughter that rang on his ear with such a curious thrill of pleasure . nor was he unsuccessful in his efforts , again and again the old walls re echoed with the welcome sound . the enchanter himself felt once more a boy as he played long games of chess with [female] . or pointed out to her his numerous pets and their diverse habits , the princess . however , was admonished to keep carefully within her mother 's sight ; she wast herefore unable to scramble with him as he wished among the wild hills and cliffs around .
it was on a strange sight that the king and [male] looked down from the flying horse . beneath them lay the city of manoa . filling with its golden battlements and temples a hollow of the mountains . here were palaces all carved over with faces of men and beasts . and with twisted patterns of serpents , the city walls were built of huge square stones .
the bridegroom then led off his bride to the dance . and celebrated such a fine wedding , that it was talked of over seven countries . tale , tale , mate ; a black little bird flew on the tree . it broke one of its legs ; a new cloak . a shabby old cloak ; it put it on .
the king and fisherman found it easy to make a large collection . picking and choosing , gathering and arranging them upon the carpet , when they had put together all there was room for . the king sat down , and pointing to a large diamond shining at a little distance . said to the fisherman , there is yet a more splendid one by the stream yonder . run , my son in law , and bring it here .
it was in the last days of [female] . a sunday , and sunny weather ; the chiming of the church bells in the bay of nissum was wafted along like a chain of sounds . the churches there are erected almost entirely of hewn boulder stones . each like a piece of rock ; the north sea might foam over them . and they would not be overthrown , most of them are without steeples .
at first it did not show itself outside in any very active form . but the wise woman had been to the cottage . and had seen her sitting alone , with such a smile of self satisfaction upon her face as would have been quite startling to her . if she had ever been startled at any thing ; for through that smile she could see lying at the root of it the worm that made it . for some smiles are like the ruddiness of certain apples .
to this the boy was silent ; but his sister 's words only served to inflame his curiosity the more . and soon after he took his how and arrows and went in the forbidden direction . after walking a long time and meeting no one , he became tired and stretched himself upon a high green knoll where the day 's warmth had melted off the snow . it was a charming place to lie , and he soon fell asleep . while he slept , the sun heat upon him .
but [female] was now close to them , standing up on the bicycle seat . he made a wonderful jump and landed squarely on the saddle of his good gray horse . and then , with a scream of dismay , the fairies flew away . now let me see , in the last story [male] had taken his good gray horse away from the fairies . but did not know what to do with the bicycle which he had borrowed from the owner of the willow tree inn !
the six retired , next morning , on their return , [female] addressed them in the kindest manner . but to no purpose ; they persisted in their refusal . he gave them till the following day . threatening them severely in case of their still proving refractory . next day , when the six little people appeared before him .
poor [female] merely stared ; for she could not imagine what he meant . in a moment he was gone ; and having taken , by the king 's permission . the flying carpet , he was back at the ambassador 's house in gluckstein . who was glad to see the prince , if it was not lady [female] ? the white roses of her cheeks turned to red roses in a moment .
`` have you not heard of prince [male] 's palace , '' was the reply , the greatest wonder of the world ? i will direct you if you have a mind to see it . the magician thanked him who spoke , and having seen the palace knew that it had been raised by the genie of the lamp . and became half mad with rage , he determined to get hold of the lamp .
and all the heroes shuddered , and looked one at the other for shame ; yet they did not punish that dark witch woman . because she had won for them the golden fleece . so the argonauts escaped for that time : but father [male] saw that foul crime . and out of the heavens he sent a storm . and swept the ship far from her course , day after day the storm drove her .
uraschimataro thanked her from his heart , and swore solemnly to do her bidding . he hid the box safely in his garments . seated himself on the back of the turtle . and vanished in the ocean path , waving his hand to the princess . three days and three nights they swam through the sea .
it was all breath thrown away , the puppets . instead of continuing the recital , redoubled their noise and outcries . and , putting [male] on their shoulders , they carried him in triumph before the footlights . at that moment out came the showman , he was very big . and so ugly that the sight of him was enough to frighten anyone .
so [female] knelt down in the snow , and the tsar gave him a blessing for the journey . [male] travelled for many days through deep and drifted snow . over his head the black crows flew from tree to tree . and all night when he crouched by his brushwood fire he heard the wolves howling and the foxes barking in the great forest . but no beast or bird or prowling robber ever tried to hurt him .
in course of time , this came also , and the queen took the little girl out of the basket . and placed it with her son in a golden cradle which glittered with precious stones . next she sent for the king , who nearly went mad with joy at the sight of the children . soon there came a day when the whole court was ordered to be present at the christening of the royal babies . and when all was ready the queen softly opened the window a little , and let the goose wing fly out .
when i am in a very new bit of country . where generalizations and multiplications follow every fact . i am sometimes reminded of the fashion of our talk whose statements tried to exceed themselves . in a kind of pyrotechnic pattern bursting at last into nothing and the night . we might have been praising climate or crops or real estate .
the elder was [female] than the day . and the queen was so delighted , that it was feared some harm might come to her from her great joy . the same fairy who had assisted at the birth of little [female] . was present upon this occasion , and in order to moderate the joy of the queen . she told her that this little princess would have no gifts of mind at all .
for the black man had made a bundle of his bracelets and shell necklaces and little gold ornaments and had traveled many miles into another country . where the ancient and royal tribe of hippopotamuses was unknown . and he set up for a great chief , because of his riches . and people bowed down before him , by day he was proud and swaggering . but at night he tumbled and tossed upon his bed and could not sleep .
next they went to the lapland woman . who had made some new clothes for them , and put their sleighs in order . both the reindeer ran by their side . and followed them as far as the boundaries of the country . where the first green leaves were budding , and here they took leave of the two reindeer and the lapland woman .
now the little mermaid saw that they were in danger . and she had for her own sake to beware of the floating beams and wreckage . one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see at all . but when the lightning flashed it became so light that she could see all on board . every man was looking out for his own safety as best he could .
now the king and queen having gone to a distant farm to superintend the reapers . some one approached the window , knocked at it , and said to the prince . `` little prince , i am come to marry your eldest sister . '' the young prince replied : `` wait a moment , you shall have her directly . '' he called his eldest sister , and as soon as she entered the room .
`` i am lost , '' murmured the poor merchant to himself . `` the king 's soldiers are already at the door . '' and advancing unsteadily across the room , he threw the door open wide . a gust of wind from the sea blew in . which bent back the flame of the [male] in his hand .
yes , there was no help for it , she had to let him in . and when he was , he lay on the ground and slept like a top . some time after , [female] came again with the stand to the spinning wheel . and sat down under the princess window , and began to file at it . for it was not quite fit for use , when she heard him filing .
at last the hard hearted brother heard of their good fortune . he had married since his mother and brother had gone away . so he took his wife and went to pay a visit to his younger brother . it was not long before he had heard the whole story of their good fortune . and how the lion had given them all the gold .
in this way the merchant 's fears were stilled . and , with a comparatively light heart , he travelled on to his village . and within a week or so returned to the city with half a dozen sturdy young nephews and friends whom he had enlisted to help him carry home his precious box . at the great market place in the centre of the city the merchant left his friends . saying that he would go and get the box of jewels and rejoin them .
and he told the tale of what had befallen him from first to last that night . the tale was long , and may be [male] was weary , it 's asleep he must have fallen . for when he awoke he lay on the hill side under the open heavens . and his horse grazed at his side , i will tell you a story about the [male] . there was once a farmer who was seeking a servant , and the [male] met him and said .
grasshopper placed his friend , the pipe bearer . and the warriors , near enough to see all that passed , while he went alone to the lodge . as he entered , grasshopper saw five horrid looking manitoes in the act of eating . it was the father and his four sons . they were really hideous to look upon , their eyes were swimming low in their heads .
then the man of the strong arm killed the king and every one of his army with a single blow . then he departed with the queen and the castle to the home of the young man . and as soon as they got there the hero married the queen . and , with her and his mother , they lived very happily to a good old age . once , a very long time ago , before aeroplanes emulated eagles and motor cars ran along swifter than the foxes .
there is little noise without , abundant space , and no confusion . the open area devoted to the market is divided into three portions . the calf market , the cattle market . the sheep market , calves at eight , cattle at ten . sheep at midday , all is very clean , the calf market is a raised platform of stone .
when this came to the king 's knowledge , he despatched troops in pursuit of [male] . to stop the road upon him , whilst he himself went out and overtaking the vizier . smote him on the head with his [male] and slew him . then he took his daughter by force and returning to his dwelling place . went in to her and married her , [female] resigned herself with [female] to that which betided her and committed her affair to god the most high .
i must not forget to mention that much disturbance was caused in the palace by [male] 's sudden disappearance . for when the grand duke sent orders next day to behead the dwarf . if he had not found the necessary herbs , the dwarf was not to be found . the prince hinted that the duke had allowed his cook to escape . and had therefore broken his word , the matter ended in a great war between the two princes .
it is curious how little children of one country know about the lives and interests of the children of another . perhaps if english people would send their children over to [location] . instead of their journalists , singers , etc. , the danger of an international war would be lessened . the children would be sure to fall in love with [location] . for it is the land above all others that appeals to children .
one hot and thirsty day in the height of summer a lion and a boar came down to a little spring at the same moment to drink . in a trice they were quarrelling as to who should drink first , the quarrel soon became a fight and they attacked one another with the utmost fury . presently , stopping for a moment to take breath , they saw some vultures seated on a rock above evidently waiting for one of them to be killed . when they would fly down and feed upon the carcase , the sight sobered them at once . and they made up their quarrel , saying , `` we had much better be friends than fight and be eaten by vultures .

soon after this a shepherd happened to pass by with his flock , and while he was slowly following the sheep . who paused here and there by the wayside to browse on the tender grass . he heard a pitiful voice wailing . they insist on my taking her , and i do not want her . for i am too old , and i really can not have her , the shepherd was much startled .

no man can sell or exchange either his [male] land or his garden plots . and changes in their ownership therefore only arise through death and inheritance . this statement , however , is , i think , subject to the qualification that an owner of bush land will sometimes allow his son or other male descendant to clear and make for himself a garden in it . but i am not sure as to the point , subject to these three allowances . i may dismiss the widow entirely in dealing with the law of inheritance .

up above were the stars and stripes , and around a portrait of [male] he had painted a majestic eagle . with lightnings blazing from his beak and his foot just clasping the whole globe . which the wings overshadowed , [male] said , with a sad smile . `` here , you see , i have a country ! '' over the foot of the bed was a great map of [location] .
as for the former favourite , he was so miserable over the sight of [male] 's happiness that at length he could bear it no longer . he sold his house and goods and sailed away . no one knew whither , and if anyone regretted him . it was not [male] , there was once a baron so rich and powerful that only the king himself was greater . he was very fierce and warlike , and what he wished for he took from rich and poor alike .
he had hardly finished his words when the palace . with the princess and the jew , was transported to the island of the seven seas . then the genii seized the lad , and were about to throw him into the bottomless sea . when they took pity on him . he being their former master , and left him in a wilderness on the shore .
next day she was dressed in silk and velvet from head to foot . they asked her to stay at the palace and have a good time . but she only begged them to give her a little carriage and horse . and a little pair of boots , so that she might drive out into the wide world to look for [female] . they gave her a pair of boots and a muff .

and their mother was in a great rage because white [female] was not dead . then she went out to see if black [female] was still alive , and she had still her plate full of meat . and she was shedding tears of blood . because she had such a bad headache , and their mother could not understand how it was that white [female] was not dead . and she boiled with rage , and one day it happened that a tradesman was passing the house with sweets and cakes in his van .

the family went to bed , and in the morning he was gone . in about a month after he began to come regularly every night about eleven o'clock . the signal which he gave was thrusting a hairy arm through a hole in the door . which was then opened , and the family retired to bed , leaving him the room to himself . if they did not open the door , some accident was sure to happen next day to themselves or their cattle .
at last , when he was quite a big lad , he one day took his bow and arrow . and went out to seek for game , coming by chance past the palace where the white hind lived in wicked [male] and magnificence . he saw some pigeons fluttering round the white marble turrets . and , taking good aim , shot one dead , it came tumbling past the very window where the white queen was sitting . she rose to see what was the matter , and looked out , at the first glance of the handsome young lad standing there bow in hand .
then in a trice the dancers all lost breath . and the dance parted as they staggered aside ; and at the door of the shed young [female] stood . and gazed through the broken revel at little [female] , and she stood gazing at him . and behind and above him , along the walls of the hut . and over the doorway , and making lovely the very roof , she saw a cloud of [male] .
`` why should we give ourselves a great deal of trouble to search ?

that [female] , this child , this dreamer . who in [female] 's opinion possessed no knightly qualities whatsoever . should be some day lord and possessor of so many noble castles and estates with their numerous dependants . while to his lot had fallen nothing but one small and half ruined castle . to which not even a single village was attached -- this vexed him , and in his heart burned envious hatred towards the orphan child .
mrs. [female] kept close behind him . and it was well she did ; for he nearly tumbled down . so great was his surprise when he beheld the old familiar wall after the good fairies love and pity had worked their pretty miracle in the moonlight . the ragged hole had changed to a little arched door , painted red , on either side stood a green tub . with a tall oleander in full bloom ; from the arch above hung a great bunch of gay flowers .

they heard the song of the priests . and saw the wild dance of the savage to the sound of the drums and trumpets of bone . the pyramids of [location] rising to the clouds . columns and sphinxes , overthrown and buried in the sand . followed in their turn ; while the northern lights flashed out over the extinguished volcanoes of the north .
it is this point of view which makes it possible for many of [location] to live happily in rented houses whose architecture and arrangement often give [location] cold shivers . we are not to blame if all the proportions are wrong ; and there is a certain pleasure in getting the better of difficulties . it is almost impossible to give a list of furniture for each room in a house . as each house is a law unto itself . but the fundamental principles of beauty and utility and appropriateness apply to all .
in a far-off country there was once a little girl who was called [female] . because her curly hair shone brightly , she was a sad romp . and so restless that she could not be kept quiet at home , but must needs run out and away , without leave . one day she started off into a wood to gather wild flowers . and into the fields to chase butterflies , she ran here and she ran there .
and at that the populace went wild , you never saw such a change come over a nation of people in your life . they showered attentions upon [female] until she was so delighted that she scarcely knew how to deport herself . they proclaimed her a heroine . they brought a sort of sedan chair . borne , not by the common cabbage butterflies who usually carried them .
you may guess , gentlemen , how sorry i was for having fallen into the hands of such a prattling impertinent [female] . what an unseasonable adventure it was for a lover preparing for an interview ! i was quite angry , i do not trouble my head . said i , in anger , with your advice and predictions . nor did i call you to consult your astrology .
[female] had many suitors , but she cared for none of them except [female] . she would gladly have married him in spite of his poverty . but her father was covetous as well as rich , he had no wish for a poor son in law . and [male] was so beautiful he expected her to marry some rich merchant . or a well to do farmer at least , but if [female] could not have [female] for a husband .
she told him what the fairies had said of [male] . and begged for advice , his reply was that the princess must be placed in a tower and never be allowed to leave it . the queen tendered her thanks . and having bestowed liberal alms upon him , returned to tell everything to the king . when the king had heard her news he gave orders at once for a great tower to be built .
before either could complete a sentence , it was evident that the invader had been expelled from the house opposite . the shrubs under the archway swayed and burst apart , as that unwelcome guest was shot out of them like a cannon ball . he was a sturdy figure in a small and tilted tyrolean felt hat . a figure that had indeed something generally tyrolean about it . the man 's shoulders were big and broad , but his legs were neat and active in knee breeches and knitted stockings .
when the storm had cleared , and the morning sun shone out . those who found courage to visit the spot beheld the forms of [female] and her lover [female] lying dead upon the shrivelled turf . ever since that time , the spot has been shunned by all , and still . by their firesides on the winter nights . the peasants tell the tale of [female] .
he first travelled through thessaly and arrived at the river echedorus . where he met the giant [male] . the son of [male] and [male] . who challenged him to single combat , in this encounter [male] completely vanquished { 248 } his opponent . who was killed in the contest ; but now a mightier adversary appeared on the scene .
there was only the last of day in the forest , but nod , dangling in terror . could clearly see the [male] peering at him from beneath the unstirring branches . his colourless skin , his long yellow hair . his musket , his fixed , glittering eyes , and there came suddenly a voice out of the [male] . like none the little [male] had ever heard in his life before .
long , long have i bewailed the sev'rance of our loves , with tears that from my lids streamed down like burning rain . and vowed that , if the days should reunite [location] two , my lips should never speak of severance again . joy hath o'erwhelmed me so that . for the very stress of that which gladdens me , to weeping i am fain . tears are become to you a habit .
immediately the king sent for his son in law and commanded him to explain what had happened . but [male] looked at his royal father in law and answered never a word . then the king was very angry , and calling a council together , he charged [male] with having been guilty of witchcraft . and of having deceived the king , and having made away with the princess ; and he was condemned to imprisonment in a high stone tower . with neither meat nor drink , till he should die of starvation .
but she was not willing that he should go without her . whatever comes , we meet it side by side , ', she declared . nothing that he could say would persuade her to do otherwise , and so at last he consented . but as they drew nearer to the pit . the noisome odor of its fumes swept toward her and overcame her , her face grew pale .
weeping all the while , the wife wrapped the baby in a piece of old skirt and placed it in her husband 's arms . on the way to the chapel , [male] came to a crossroads where he met an old woman . `` grandmother , '' he said , `` will you be godmother to my child ? '' and he explained to her how every one else had refused on account of his poverty and how in desperation he had decided to ask the first person he met . `` and so , dear grandmother , '' he concluded , `` i am asking you . ''
the prince , out of grateful remembrance of the princess [female] 's first gift to him bestowed the right of bearing her name upon the most beautiful of the martens . and that is why they are called sables to this day . once upon a time there lived a young man named [male] . who was as good and handsome as his elder brother [male] was ugly and wicked . their mother detested her eldest son , and had only eyes for the youngest .
so saying , the fairy again became a moth and fluttered to the window . little [female] opened it , the brown moth settled for a moment upon her lips as if it wished to kiss her . and then it flew out into the [female] , away and away , little [female] watched her till her pretty wings were lost in the blue distance . then she turned and took her bracelet , and put it on her wrist . where , from that day forward , she always wore it night and day .
yet [female] 's heart still beat with alarm as she sheltered her younger brothers . for [female] came not , and she feared lest he were lost forever . but , at noon , sailing he came over the breast of the blue waters . with head erect and plumage sunlit . and under the feathers of her breast did [male] draw him .
now the young laird 's mother had heard of [female] . and it may be that she was glad that her son should wish to bring to the castle so beautiful a bride . yet she had no wish for the [female] to be won by aught save by love for her dear son alone . [female] had refused to wed with lord or noble , it was true . yet the broad lands , the ancient castle of the macdonalds .
the farmer was very much in love with his pretty prize . and as promises are easily made , he took oath that no clay should ever touch her . they were married and lived very happily together , years passed and the man was still a good husband and lover . he kept up the habit which he had learned from a sailor friend . every night , when far from home and out on the sea .
that picture , to [female] it seemed worth all the rest of the world put together . he knew , too , the story which was told of it . making it as holy to his eyes as the tombs of his own ancestors . the apprentices joked over it , calling it [male] 's back door , [male] 's night cap , and many other nicknames .
in sending the presents care must be taken not to fold the silk robe . the two silk robes that are sent on the marriage night must be placed with the collars stitched together in a peculiar fashion . the ceremonies of sending the litter to fetch the bride on the wedding night are as follows . in families of good position , one of the principal retainers on either side is deputed to accompany the bride and to receive her . matting is spread before the entrance door , upon which the bride 's litter is placed .
then he told the prince of ancient rivers running through terrible deserts . whose sands glitter with golden grains and are yellow in the fierce heat of the sun . and of dreary mines where the indian slaves work in gangs tied together . never seeing the light of day ; and lastly ( for he was a man of much knowledge . and had travelled far ) , he told him of the valley of the [location] in the new world .
the valet honestly avowed that he was too scared to be certain of anything . but was ready to swear that to his ears the words uttered seemed to be swedish . he had once heard sailors from [location] talking . and the chatter sounded like their lingo , then there was boots . the errand boy , who believed that it was the devil .
`` oh , oh , oh , '' says the little pretty one , as she saw all these things . and the bad ones , they saw how her eyes shone . and they came and looked over her shoulder , and saw how all the world was there . in the spinning apple and the silver saucer . and the old father came and looked over her shoulder too , and he saw the market at nijni novgorod .
being come into a vast square in the heart of the city . i perceived a great gate covered with plates of gold . the two doors of which stood open , and a curtain of silk stuff seemed to be drawn before it . i also saw a lamp hanging over the gate , after i had well considered . i made no doubt but that it was the palace of the prince who reigned over that country .
now they went to the king 's armory . where the elder brothers chose for themselves two beautiful gold mounted swords . but the youngest brother , who had more wit , picked out a rusty steel sword . this rusty sword now jumped out of the sheath , now sprang in again , -- played unceasingly . the two elder brothers laughed at the youngest again , but he put this as well as their former ridicule quietly in his pocket .
immediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door . before the threshold , however , it began to weave a carpet which was more beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet beheld . lilies and roses blossomed on both sides of it . and on a golden ground in the centre green branches ascended . under which bounded hares and rabbits , stags and deer stretched their heads in between them .
but the bride wept and said nothing . and the rabbit went away , but very soon came back again , `` get up , get up ! '' said he , `` the wedding folk are waiting . '' but the bride said nothing , and the rabbit went away . then she made a figure of straw .
great joy was manifested upon their arrival at the starry plains . the star chief invited all his people to a feast . and when they had assembled , he proclaimed aloud that each one might continue as he was . an inhabitant of his own dominions , or select of the earthly gifts such as he liked best . a very strange confusion immediately arose ; not one but sprang forward , some chose a foot .
undine was sincerely grieved ; she entreated [female] to pursue their friend at once . and bring her back with him , alas ! there was little need of entreaty . his passion for [male] returned with fresh violence . he searched the castle all over , asking everyone if they could tell him in what direction the fair one had fled . he could discover nothing ; and now he had mounted his horse in the court .
the old man was very glad to see them , all day he had missed them and had wondered where they were . he had saved some supper for them and was surprised that they did not seem more hungry for it . he was still very sad , all day people had been coming to the hut to buy rice from him . and when they found he had none to sell . they had been very much disappointed , some of them had even been angry and had scolded him .
a little english girl , named [female] , came over to visit her german friends . [female] and [female] , shortly before easter this year . and she was much surprised to find all the shop windows filled with hares . hares made of chocolate , toy hares . hares with fine red coats on , hares trundling wheelbarrows or carrying baskets full of easter eggs .
lilybell lay with the cloak of [female] folded round her . and the golden wand in her hand , waiting for the crown and the kiss that should wake her from this long sleep . [female] gave them both ; and when her eyes opened and she stretched out her arms to him . he was the happiest fairy in the world . the brownies told all he had done , and how at last he had learned to be [male] .
one morning [female] was busy scouring a wooden tub . when a noble lady happened to pass through the village , the girl 's bright face as she stood in the front of the door with her tub attracted the lady . and she stopped and called the girl to come and speak to her , would you not like to come and enter my service ? ', she asked . `` oh , i will settle that , '' answered the lady ; and so she did . and the same day they set out for the lady 's house .
in due time the seven ranis each gave birth to a son . but the son of the youngest [male] was the most beautiful with a face like a mongoose . the eldest [male] was jealous of the beauty of the youngest [male] 's son so one day she sent the youngest [female] to fetch some water . and during her absence took up the mongoose boy and putting a stone and a broom in its place took the child away and buried it in the pit from which the potters dig their earth . when the raja heard that his youngest wife had given birth to nothing but a stone and a broom he was very angry and turned her out of the palace .
then [female] took the soft pitch and made a wide pathway of it . after that he smeared his feet all over with the tallow . so that he stuck to the soft pitch no more than water sticks to a cabbage leaf . then he shouldered his bag of barley corn and went up to the giant 's castle . and hunted around and hunted around until he had found where the grey goose was .
she , charmed with the pretty little pigeon , caressed it in her turn . and promised it that , if it would stay with her . she would love it always , [male] and [male] threw themselves at the feet of the hermit . whose form also began to change , his soiled garments became of dazzling whiteness . and his long beard and withered face grew into the flowing hair and lovely countenance of fairy candide .
he tried by all means in his power to win the love of [male] . but the youth took no heed , and in spite of the west wind 's [male] words and tender . soft caresses , he continued to love [male] best . then [male] became angry and jealous , day by day he watched the two friends . and waited his opportunity for revenge , now it happened one bright spring morning that [male] and [male] were playing a game of quoits together .
then [female] sent a messenger to the neighbouring houses . bearing the following message : -- we , the ronins who were formerly in the service of [female] no [location] . are this night about to break into the palace of [female] no suké . to avenge our lord , as we are neither night robbers nor ruffians . no hurt will be done to the neighbouring houses .
this extravagant and ruinous pomp fell into disuse during the reigns of [female] xi. . [male] viii. , and [male] . but reappeared in that of [male] i , this prince . after his first wars in [male] , imported the cookery and the gastronomic luxury of that country . where the art of good living , especially in [male] .
after these instructions i took leave of my benefactress . and her mother , with all the testimonies of the most perfect gratitude . and a sincere protestation never to forget my obligation to them . and then went home , all things happened as the beautiful and humane enchantress had foretold . [female] was not long before she came home , as she entered the court .
but [female] could not answer , and only stared at the lady , as she had before stared at her drowned boy . then the lady caught sight of the dead thing at the bottom of the water . and rushed in , and , plunging down , struggled and groped until she reached it . then she rose and stood up with the dead body of her little son in her arms . his head hanging back , and the water streaming from him .
an unfamiliar joke is but rarely to be discovered in the lower strata of fiction . he who has read the folk tales of one country only . is apt to attribute to its inhabitants a comic originality to which they can lay no claim . and so a russian who knows the stories of his own land . but has not studied those of other countries , is very liable to credit the skazkas with the undivided possession of a number of `` merry jests ''
the kitten went fast asleep in her lap , and violet . folding her hands , looked up among the leaves , and across where the boughs parted a little into the wood . and down at her feet , where the grass grew so long and fine , and was sprinkled over with such pretty little leaves . as tiny , some of them , as violet 's finger nails . and yet as beautifully scolloped or pointed , and as perfectly finished , as the stoutest laurel or broadest oak leaf in the wood .
but just then out came the farmer in his shirt , who had been waked by all this clatter . and wanted to see what was going on , so the thieves took to their heels . and [female] after them , upsetting the farmer in her flight . now the next night the thieves said they must go and steal a fat goose . and [female] was to shew them the way .
then the lovely season flew on with her [female] and song . and [female] went swiftly over hill and [female] till she came to the place where summer lived . here the sun shone warmly on early fruit and ripening grain . the wind blew freshly over sweet hay fields and rustled the thick branches of the trees . heavy dews and soft showers refreshed the growing things .
the poor little squirrel was indeed at her wits end how to perform the task . for how could so small an animal make so difficult a dish ? she tried . and she tried , but failed each time in her attempts . until it was nearly morning , just then the god [male] and his wife [male] were taking a walk in the dawning light of day . [male] saw the poor little squirrel 's efforts .
well , well , even my servants laugh at , pity me . here i am , cooled down into the quietest man in the world , yet obliged to put myself in a passion whenever my wife pleases . it is very hard to lose my temper and my character at her bidding . but if i do not she would put herself into such a rage with me . that i should be even worse off ; -- of the two evils i must choose the least .
with their fears thus verified , the robbers anxiously entered the cave to view the traces of its late visitant . there they saw piled by the door the treasure which [person] had sought to carry away . but while restoring this to its place they failed altogether to detect the earlier loss which [person] had caused them . reckoning , however , that as one had discovered the secret of entry others also might know of it . they determined to leave an example for any who might venture thither on a similar errand .
we reached our old home ; but the cottage was in ruins . and we had to build a new one , with the aid of some neighbors . chiefly women , the walls were in a few days erected . and very soon covered with a roof of olive branches , my mother obtained a living by making bottle cases of bark and skins . and i kept the sheep belonging to the priests .
all the birds of the air from the lower end of the world to the upper end of the world . and all the wild beasts and tame from the four ends of the earth . came flocking to see the fight , but at length and at last , after a long and terrible fight . the amadan , seeing the little spot above the heart that the red woman had told him of . struck for it and hit it .
so the youngest prince set out to look for his brother , and he too lost his way in the wood and night overtook him . then he came to the clearing among the trees . where the fire was burning and where the old woman was raking sticks and leaves into the flames . and he asked her if he might spend the night beside her fire . as it was too late and too dark to go back to the town , and he said she might .
watched by the admiring eyes of [male] and his followers the human octopus wriggled and squirmed his way out of the enchanter 's palace . and , whether he flew through the air , or swam through the waters . to queen [female] 's fairy kingdom . using his tentacles as propellers , is a matter for conjecture . but , at any rate , he got there with all tentacles .
there had been a great commotion in fairyland , the gnomes . who formed the opposition party -- had turned disloyal and wanted a republic . whereupon the king , hurt in his dignity , insisted upon abdicating , in fact . he was tired of power , and glad of the excuse to resign . in spite of the prayers and entreaties of those who desired him to remain in office he returned to the treasury the golden key .
the muni , when [male] did not come back , knew that something must have happened to him so he sent a crow to see what was the matter . the crow came back and said that one bel fruit had been picked but that he could not see [male] . then the muni sent the crow to bring him the droppings of the rakshasas . the crow did so and from the droppings the muni restored [male] to life . the muni reproved [male] for his failure and told him that if he wished to make a second attempt he must remember his behest to pick only the biggest bel fruit .

so the rose mallow prepared to follow the princess 's advice , and to leave the lilies . and lupins , and all the sweets of the garden behind him . he lay tossing on his fragrant couch in a fit of anger . for some time princess [male] 's disdain of all the great princes and nobles whom he had sent to woo her had offended him deeply . but on this particular afternoon his messengers had informed him of the [female] 's morning interview with the rose mallow .
[male] and tepa dwelt together and lived on baked cakes . one day they met a bear in the jungle . `` now i will eat you '' growled the bear , `` spare us , '' said [male] and tepa `` and tomorrow we will beg some food and bake it into cakes and give it to you , '' so the bear let them go away to beg ; but when they came back they ate the food which they had procured and then hid themselves inside a hollow gourd .
the sparrows feasted bravely and listened attentively ; they even stood in ranks like the pigeons . but it did not suit them , so having satisfied their hunger . they left the pigeons passing their own opinions upon them to each other and slipped through the garden railings . the door of a room in the house . leading into the garden , stood open , and one of them , feeling brave after his good dinner .
the queen was very happy at the success of her scheme . the prince took a carriage drawn by three great frogs with great big wings . which made the carriage simply fly , [male] came out mysteriously by a little door . and the prince , who was awaiting her appearance , at once put his arms around her and swore eternal faith . but , as he was not in any humour to take a long journey in the flying carriage without marrying the princess whom he loved .
then suddenly , mother [female] stood beside her in the midst of the fire . in her arms she held the princess 's youngest baby . and the others stood , one upon one side and the other upon the other . and held on to her skirts , even yet the princess would have answered `` no ; '' but when she saw her children standing in the midst of the fire with her .
like a falling star , it shivered and glimmered in the rays of the moon as it descended . attracting the attention of a speckled trout , who opened his mouth and swallowed it as it splashed upon the silvery surface of the water . `` your [male] spear has done me good service in times gone by , '' exclaimed the wicked king , not knowing that its owner had unknowingly been the cause of saving him at the present moment . on came the cavalcade , the wicked attendants of the king inside the castle opening the gates and allowing him and his men to enter the courtyard .
to these he gives the names of the gnomes . the nymphs or undines , the sylphs or sylvestres . the salamanders , the pigmies and the sirens . he attributes to them curious qualities and shapes . they can , for instance , pass through matter .
the five years of struggles through which she had passed . those years of prayers and struggles , all disappeared . she no longer saw her black garments . even the walls of her cell had fallen ; a whole world lay open before her . yes , it was the past which transported her to its magic circle .
the work cost him much time . but the evening was long and he had nothing better to do . finally he gave a loud and delighted laugh at the result of his labors and placed the wooden cat . now completed , upon the hearth opposite the real one , [female] thereupon glared at her image . raised her hair in anger , and uttered a defiant mew .
when the soup was ready , she called out to her father to come to dinner . no reply came from him , but there was a human head in the forest . and it replied , `` i am coming immediately , '' and when the head arrived . it cried , [female] . open the door , she opened it .
when he reached the house his little son . delighted to hold on to the benches and totter towards his father . seized him by the leg to steady himself . in the meantime the boy had grown up , and he was both clever and wise . but the nearer the end of the twelve years came .
this is how it happened that the hedgehog made the [male] run races with him on the buxtehuder heath till he died . and since that time no [male] has ever had any fancy for running races with a buxtehuder hedgehog . the moral of this story , however , is , firstly , that no one . however great he may be , should permit himself to jest at any one beneath him . even if he be only a hedgehog , and , secondly , it teaches .
but they were two of the kindest old people in the world . and would cheerfully have gone without their dinners , any day , rather than refuse a slice of their brown loaf . a cup of new milk , and a spoonful of honey . to the weary traveller who might pause before their door , they felt as if such guests had a sort of holiness . and that they ought , therefore , to treat them better and more bountifully than their own selves .
it is even thus with the sunbeams of the human heart . trifling things they are in themselves . for the heart is wonderfully constituted , and it vibrates to the slightest touch . but without them life is a blank . all seems cold and lifeless as the marble slab which marks the spot where the departed loved one lies .
the merchants thanked the stranger , and called him their preserver . indeed , the number of the robbers was so great , that the caravan could not . probably , for any length of time , have offered an effectual resistance . with lighter hearts they now gave themselves to sleep . and when the sun began to sink , and the evening wind to pass over the sand plain .
here the king wept , among the tears of the lord chief justice . the poet laureate ( who had been awfully frightened when he heard of the rattlesnakes ) . the maids of honour , the chaplain royal . and everyone but colonel mcdougal . a scottish soldier of fortune , who maintained a military reserve .
[female] chose the latter ; and embarking on board a merchant ship . arrived safely in sight of [female] zummaun 's capital . but just before it entered the port , the ship struck upon a rock . by the unskilfulness of the pilot , and foundered : it went down in sight of the castle . where at that time were the king and his grand vizier .
when they saw that they could not by any means prevail on him to go in with them . they came out to him with meat and drink . and the best of everything that they had prepared for the wedding . but the prince refused to touch anything , and would do nothing but put the horses in as quickly as he could . at last , however , the bride 's sister rolled an apple across the yard to him .
she had been brought up in complete solitude , near as was the palace of the fairy to the château in which she dwelt . she saw no more persons than she might have seen in the midst of deserts . [female] 's orders to this effect were strictly followed . the lovely [female] passed her days amongst the women appointed to attend her . they were few in number , but little as were the advantages to be gained in so solitary and circumscribed a court .
the marble block was erected , the chisel hewed away large pieces . the labourer 's part was done , marks and points placed . until little by little , the stone became a body , a shape of beauty . the [female] -- as charming as was the woman made by god . the massive stone became a soaring , dancing , airy , light and graceful [female] .
[female] herself twisted about his neck her famous necklace of starry jewels . and queen [female] , his mother . hung at his girdle a jingling bunch of keys . such as was the custom for the bride to wear at norse weddings . last of all , that [male] might not see [male] 's fierce eyes and the yellow beard .
if i had not chronicled them now , from my recollection of good old farmer [female] 's gossips . i dare say [male] -- who is a careless fellow at best , and not equal to his father . ( young men seldom are in these days , according to my opinion ) . would have told the story differently , and only in fragments , to his children . and they would have varied it again in telling it to their children .
this is probably the explanation of the story of [female] . [female] , a young lady of tender conscience . who was a skilful performer with the divining [female] , but shrank from putting her powers in operation . lest she should be indulging in unlawful acts , she consulted the pere [female] . author of a work already referred to in this paper .
then [female] the dwarf , with great majesty . walked out of the council house of [male] . and the attending dwarfs marched behind him in procession . down the passages in the earth the dwarfs went . singing the song of [male] 's triumph over [male] .
it sang of the happy days when it could merrily fly about . of fresh green corn in the fields , and of the time when it could soar almost up to the clouds . the poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage . the little [female] would have liked so much to help it , but what could be done ? indeed , that was very difficult for such a small flower to find out , it entirely forgot how beautiful everything around it was .
and even as that last [female] was uttered , and back to nod 's mind came that morning leagues . leagues away , and himself sitting on his father 's shoulder . clutching the long cold barrel of the little portingal 's gun . even at that moment a faint halloo came echoing across the steeps . and , turning , the mulla mulgars saw climbing towards them between the trees [male] and [male] .
there they concealed themselves , to await the night . as soon as it was dark , guided by [female] , they proceeded softly to the brook . where the aqueduct commenced , and soon found it , there they left [female] and a servant with the horses . and prepared themselves for the descent : before they started . however , [female] once more repeated , with precision , the directions she had given .
seeing his opportunity , [male] used all his arts of persuasion . and the result was that those of the party who had not got beyond hearing when the above mentioned incident took place . wheeled boldly and bodily round , and retraced their steps towards the knoll field . [male] and long leading the way , preceded by `` simple [male] , '' who declined to walk with any of them , but trotted on ahead , as for [male] .
oh , what play and happiness they had that day . how the green grass kissed their feet , and how the smell of clover came with the springtime breezes from the meadow yonder ! the red headed woodpecker heard them at play . and she clambered out of the hollow maple and dodged hither and thither as if she . too , shared their merriment , yes , and the yellow thistle bird , whose nest was in the blooming lilac bush .
on the fatal day the beasts were loosed into the arena . and among the rest a lion of huge bulk and ferocious aspect . and then the wretched slave was cast in among them , what was the amazement of the spectators . when the lion after one glance bounded up to him and lay down at his feet with every expression of affection and delight ! it was his old friend of the cave !
her dress was a soft , floating , waving material like the most delicate chiffon . it waved and floated about her with every motion . she bent down and kissed the little girl 's forehead . and the kiss was like a soft breath of damp air on her face . the sweet voice spoke , so the little girl took the mist lady 's hand .
they built themselves a bonny boat . for they could best come to the beast 's lair by sea . and they two set out together ; they two and no other , for everyone else was afraid to go with them . they sailed out and on and around , and so they came within sight of estmere crag . and there lay the great worm stretched in and out among the rocks , it was a gruesome sight .
the japanese tops are of several kinds , some are made of univalve shells . filled with wax , those intended for contests are made of hard wood . and are iron-clad by having a heavy iron ring round as a sort of tire . the boys wind and throw them in a manner somewhat different from ours . the object of the player is to damage his adversary 's top .
guest of the rocks grew furious and cast his flying sword at him . cutting off his head , from that time onward he fell back again into the world of mundane pleasure and death . he sank down into the dust of the diurnal , and was no longer able to wing his way to the upper regions . later he met [male] , who delivered him . and then he was taken up in the ranks of the immortals .
they halted on their way at a rich abbey . where the abbot feasted them royally and before they left desired to show them some of the abbey 's splendours . when they had duly admired the exquisite carvings in the chapels . and the golden chalice on the high altar , he conducted them to a chapter room . where , covered with hangings of finely wrought tapestry , and gorgeous embroideries of blue and silver .
just then he looked at the fiddler , whom should he see again but old mr. [male] . he had a violin bow instead of a stick . but looked exactly like the old schoolmaster , so they went on through shady lanes and pleasant villages . everywhere the sky was blue , the sun shone . and the birds sang , but go where they would .
on such another easter morning as that on which [male] imagined he had discovered the art of making gold . i heard the tones of a psalm under the [male] 's nest . and within the crumbling walls , it was [male] last song . there was no window in the hut , only a hole in the wall . and the sun rose like a globe of burnished gold .
and so the marriage was celebrated , and there was a great feast in the castle . and another in the soldiers barracks , and illuminations all over the town and in the beautiful gardens . and all the people declared that such a wonderful sight had never been seen , and talked about it to the ends of their lives . the next day the governor despatched the princess and her bridegroom to the king . with a troop of horsemen , splendidly dressed , and he sent a mounted messenger on before them .
in the latter half of the eighteenth century those convenient pieces of furniture came into more general use . and illustrations of them as designed and made by [male] and his contemporaries will be found in the chapter dealing with that period . dr. [male] also quotes from an [location] newspaper . `` the boston news letter '' of [male] 16th , 1716 , an advertisement which was evidently published when the tall clocks .
by the time he had finished his medicine [male] had forgotten about the dream . but he kept remembering it in bits all day long . [male] looked delighted when [male] was allowed to get up and come into the garden . perhaps he knew all about the dream , for he would often stop when he was digging up a bone . and look as if he were trying to remember something , dogs have splendid dreams sometimes .
you have seen the scarlet trees and the lions over seas . you have eaten ostrich eggs , and turned the turtles off their legs . such a life is very fine , but it 's not so nice as mine . you must often , as you trod , have wearied not to be abroad , you have curious things to eat . i am fed on proper meat ; you must dwell beyond the foam .
one morning , however , just after she had rubbed his eyes . and before she had washed her hands , she made out she had dropped the box by accident . and when she stooped to pick it up she managed to rub one eye with a finger that had a little ointment upon it . the child did not see what she had done , but when [female] looked about her what a wonderful change had come over the garden . where all had seemed lonely and silent before , were crowds of little people playing around or going seriously about their business .
this divinity was introduced into [female] by its first colonists from phrygia . in [location] minor , in which country she was worshipped under the name of [female] . the people of [female] adored her as the great mother . more especially in her signification as the sustainer of the vegetable world . seeing , however , that year by year .
the godmother saw that the sexton was whispering something unfriendly . so she pulled out a shining ducat from her pocket . stepped up to the priest , and pressed it into his hand . the priest blinked his eyes in amazement . looking first at the ducat and then at the shabby old woman who had given it .
so they were drawn up out of the water and taken to the palace . where no one could possibly live happier than [male] and the fish prince . a great many years ago there was a king who talked too much , his name was [male] . and from his beautiful palace he ruled many millions of people . there was also a turtle who was even fonder of talking than the king , and he lived in a pond in the king 's garden .
in the courtyard stood a huge [male] block about twenty steps from the house . and when meal times came round the old man with the long beard went to the block . drew out a small silver staff , and struck the stone with it three times . so that the sound could be heard a long way off , at the third blow . out sprang a large golden cock , and stood upon the stone , whenever he crowed and flapped his wings the rock opened and something came out of it .
all the children ran to meet her , and looked so eagerly at the pretty [female] fruit . that she gave to each of them a handful . but to the little sister , who was so modest and beautiful , she gave a small basket . covered with green leaves , and filled with the delicious berries , when the other children would have taken the basket for themselves . the old woman prevented them ; and , while they went .
going to [female] 's house one day . and finding his brother was out , [male] took a knife and killed all the silkworms . cutting each poor little creature in two ; then he went home without having been seen by anybody . when [male] came home he was dismayed to find his silkworms in this state . but he did not suspect who had done him this bad trick .
when everything was ready for the feast , and the bride was dressed in the most beautiful embroidered dress to be found in [location] . the maids took hold of the helmet to lift it off her head . so that they might do her hair in the latest fashion . but the helmet would not come , and the harder they pulled . the faster it seemed to be , till the poor girl yelled with pain .
there he was able by his magic skill to endow her inanimate body with the semblance of life . he mournfully placed the beautiful image in the vaulted halls of thuisto . where he could for ever gaze on the fatal beauty that had brought such misfortune on its possessor . she explained to [male] that if he came under his dread father 's influence . the sea king and his wild companions would strive their utmost to make him forget and neglect her careful instructions .
on arriving at the castle the king led her into marble halls . where large fountains played , and where the walls and the ceilings were covered with rich paintings . but she had no eyes for all these glorious sights . she could only mourn and weep , patiently she allowed the women to array her in royal robes . to weave pearls in her hair , and draw soft gloves over her blistered fingers .
the sun rose above the waves , and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid . who did not feel as if she were dying , she saw the bright sun . and hundreds of transparent , beautiful creatures floating around her . she could see through them the white sails of the ships and the red clouds in the sky . their speech was melodious , but could not be heard by mortal ears -- just as their bodies could not be seen by mortal eyes .
tityus , one of the earth born giants , had insulted [female] on her way to peitho . for which offence [male] flung him into tartarus . where he suffered dreadful torture , inflicted by two vultures . which perpetually gnawed his liver , [male] was a great tyrant who . according to some accounts , barbarously murdered all travellers who came into his dominions .
the old man came , took a drink , and went away , now the son wanted to put the roasted chicken on the table again . but when he took it up , it had become a great toad . which jumped into his face and sat there and never went away again , and if any one wanted to take it off . it looked venomously at him as if it would jump in his face . so that no one would venture to touch it .
far , far and high upon those mountains , on the side of one of its vast slopes . in a hollow more green than brown , a little burnie commences its existence in a spongy bit of brown ground . covered over with plants bearing white flowers—the cannach of similar scenes . at first , says one of the best of word painters of his day . you can see nothing of a rill—it is only a slyke .
in truth [female] could well marvel at the speech . for the voices were curiously alike , presently the willows parted on the other bank . and [male] could hardly forebear laughing out right , his mystery was explained , it was not two men who had done all this singing and talking . but one -- and that one a stout curtall friar who wore a long cloak over his portly frame . tied with a cord in the middle , on his head was a knight 's helmet .
but having said his prayers , fed his horse , and eaten from the scrip which the lady of the moors had made up for him . he lay down beside a thick bush and slept soundly , many were the terrible sounds that came from far below . where fierce witches and warlocks battled and tore each other in the dead valley . but sir [male] was so overcome that he awoke not , and just as the morning broke . a great serpent issued from a rock near where he lay and crept towards him to slay him .
another night came , and another still , during both of which the wise woman nursed and fed her . but she knew nothing of that , and the same one dreary day seemed ever brooding over her . all at once , on the third day , she was aware that a naked child was seated beside her . but there was something about the child that made her shudder . she never looked at [female] , but sat with her chin sunk on her chest .
notwithstanding the passion which this king had for hunting . he was the first to grant leave to the bourgeoisie to enjoy the sport . the condition he made with them was that they should always give a haunch of any animal killed to the lord of the soil . it is to this that we must trace the origin of giving the animal 's foot to the huntsman or to the person who has the lead of the hunting party . [male] xi. , however , did not at all act in this liberal manner .
it required little consideration for both father and mother to see the wisdom of the sun 's advice . and upon his suggestion they determined to wait on the cloud at the very earliest opportunity . and at an hour before he rose from his bed . which he usually made on the slopes of a mountain some leagues removed from their village . so they set out , and a long journey they had .
[male] began to [male] again , and [male] looked at him closely . and [male] apologized and said it was that tickle in his throat . and [male] said gravely , do you think i can not see through you ? come along , do , and opened her housewife , and put on her [female] . and threaded her needle , and got out the button , and made [female] stand in a patch of moonlight .
but it was not a bit of use . for she was so ugly that the king only looked the other way the whole time . and this made her very angry indeed , so the fairy tried another plan , she took the form of a beautiful [male] . and placed the king in a splendid chariot , drawn by two [female] swans . then she , too , stepped in , and together they sailed away through the air .
in this way , they would get their fruit back without the corsairs knowing any thing about it . the captain considered this an excellent plan , and ordered the chief mate to take a boat and a flag of truce . and go over to the horn o plenty , and make the proposition . the eldest boy and two of the others insisted on going also , in order that there might be no mistake about the boxes . but when the flag of truce party reached the horn o plenty they found not a corsair there !
[female] was hungry and thirsty , and tired too , so he sat him down by the spring and ate the bread and cheese he carried . and drank of the fresh water , and then he stretched himself out and went fast asleep . he had not been long asleep when the giant [male] came by that way . [male] was very much surprised to see a youth lying there and sleeping quietly beside his fountain . for none ever before had dared to venture here into this forest for fear of him .
under this title will be considered simply the foods and beverages of the people . no attempt will be made to treat of consumption in its breadth as it appears to the economist . there are few forms of animal life about the igorot that he will not and does not eat . the exceptions are mainly insectivora , and such larger animals as the mythology of the igorot says were once men . as the monkey , serpent eagle , crow , snake , etc .
so he rode on with the beautiful princess , and their way led them through the village where his two brothers had stayed . there they heard great outcry and noise . and when he asked what it was all about , they told him that two people were going to be hanged . and when he drew near he saw that it was his two brothers . who had done all sorts of evil tricks , and had wasted all their goods .
i opened the third door , and found a large aviary , paved with marble of several fine and uncommon colours . the trellis work was made of [person] wood and wood of aloes . it contained a vast number of nightingales . gold finches , canary birds , larks , and other rare singing birds . which i had never heard of ; and the vessels that held their seed and water were of the most precious [person] or agate .
in compiling the present collection i have drawn on the store of 140 tales with which i originally started . some of the best of these i reserved for this when making up the former one . that had necessarily to contain the old favourites [female] the giant killer . [female] , and the rest , which are often not so interesting or so well told as the less familiar ones buried in periodicals or folk lore collections . but since the publication of english fairy tales .
shocked , and full of consternation , the courtiers made ready to weep , practised sighing . and assumed an expression of deep affliction , intrigues were formed in every direction . it was reported that the king had discharged his ministers . the blackest calumnies were hatched , it was said that the duc de la rochecoupée had concocted a draught to send the princess to sleep . and that monsieur de [male] was his accomplice .
the prince 's good mien , noble air . and blooming youth , raised pity in every one who saw him . what do you mean , sir , said some who stood near him . to expose thus your life , which promises so much , to certain death ? can not the heads you see on all the gates of this city deter you from such an undertaking ? in the name of god , consider what you do .
the moment she saw him . [male] threw herself on her face . [female] from head to foot . but the dog had no quarrel with her . and of the violence against which he always felt bound to protest in dog fashion .
the old woman shrieked for [female] , but the queen would not listen . and only mocked when she said she was protected by the fairies . at last the poor old thing submitted to be tied up , but when the queen urged her horse on he never stirred . in vain she spurred him . he seemed turned to bronze , at the same moment the cord with which the old woman was tied changed into wreaths of flowers .
upon the opposite aside were seated the five sisters of the groom . not so like one another , one had blue eyes , another auburn curls . one a nose retroussé , a fourth was fresh and rosy , a fifth round faced . still the same pride had found a resting place on some fine feature of each face . and stamped it with the seal of sisterhood .
but the riding was very funny , and [female] soon forgot everything else in watching the gay creatures mount their various horses and fly or [organization] round the ring while the teacher . a small fellow in a gay cap and green suit . stood on the moss mound , cracking a long whip and telling them how to ride in the best fairy fashion . several lady elves learned to mount butterflies gracefully and float where they liked . sitting firmly when the winged horses alighted on the flowers , the boy elves preferred field mice .
with many thanks to the little old witch , who had so faithfully befriended him . strong desire took his leave , doing as she said he safely passed the earthquake . and in due time arrived near his own village , then he secretly hid his precious trophy . on entering the village , he found that his parents had returned from the place of their spring encampment by the wood side . and that they were in heavy sorrowing for their son .
but there happened to be among the ferrymen a smart fellow who knew more about these matters than the others . he jumped on shore , took the clay from under his right foot . and put it into his cap , and when he had set it on his head he perceived that all the sand hills east of aalborg were completely covered with little troll people . who had all pointed red caps on their heads , ever since that time there have been no dwarfs seen in vendsyssel . [male] was a valiant champion , he was born in [male] .
`` oh , the blue moon , the blue moon ! '' cried the princess ; and running down the road , she threw herself into his arms . how happy and proud they were of each other , he , because she remembered him and knew him so well by the sight of his face and the sound of his feet after all these years . and she , because he had come all that way in a pair of wooden shoes . just as he was , and had not been afraid that she would be ashamed to know him again .
in the evening the [male] came home , and while they talked together his wife asked him what he would do if any of her brothers should chance to look in upon them . if the elder were to come , said the [female] , i would strike them dead . but if the youngest came , i would go down on my knees before him. whereupon the damsel called to her youngest brother , the king 's son . to come forth , the [male] was overjoyed to see him .
at once , he began to carry out of the stone the rich stores he found there . his godmother placed a tiny piece of cloth by the stone and when [female] had piled it high with cupboards . tables and chairs , she raised it very carefully and placed it under the tree . in spite of all her care , it happened that she broke the leg of a chair and knocked off a corner of cupboard . she was very sorry , but [female] soothed her by saying that he would repair everything .
across the bay he held his way . and swam with all his might ; it was so dark he scarce could mark the mountain 's frowning height . but soon he gain d the rocky land , and dripping from the wave he peer d around , till he had found the hateful giant 's cave . there right afore the giant 's door he dug a huge big hole .
once upon a time there were two princes who were twins . their names were [male] and [male] . and they lived in the pleasant vale of [male] . far away in [location] , they had fruitful meadows and vineyards . sheep and oxen , great herds of horses feeding down in lerna fen .
now , [female] had never told a falsehood in his life and would not tell one now . after looking at the stranger for a moment he said . so he trudged along with the stranger , they had not gone far . when they came to a field where men were at work . cutting the tall grass , then they spread it out in the sun to dry .
on this some men went to the king and told him what the fakir had said . his majesty came , and seeing the fakir so solemn and earnest in his devotions . he was afraid to rouse his anger , lest peradventure the displeasure of heaven should descend on him . and so he placed his hands together in the attitude of a supplicant . and asked , `` how did you get my daughter 's necklace ? ''
the dryad was now alone , but she was still frightened , she was sure there were no trees here which would suit her and she was afraid of meeting some other cruel person . so she slipped into a side street , and there she saw a light coming through a glass door . this was the only light in the street and she went up to it and looked in . inside was a small room , not very well furnished , and by a table . with a light on it , there sat a girl .
but even while he was so thinking he heard fierce and angry snortings . and , coming swiftly from the island to the shore , he saw the swimming and prancing steeds . sometimes their heads and manes only were visible , and sometimes , rearing , they rose half out of the water . and , striking it with their hoofs , churned it into foam . and tossed the white spray to the skies , as they approached nearer and nearer their snortings became more terrible .
what a beautiful place the sea is , and the old seal . instead of trying to bite him , looked at him with his soft sleepy winking eyes . and said , good tide to you , my little man . are you looking for your brothers and sisters ? i passed them all at play outside .
the poet spoke sadly , and his eyes were dim with tears . so , likewise , were those of [male] , then all the people looked . and saw that what the deep sighted poet said was true , the prophecy was fulfilled . but [male] , having finished what he had to say , took the poet 's arm . and walked slowly homeward , still hoping that some wiser and better man than himself would by and by appear .
it was not without shedding a flood of tears that my mother could force herself to leave me . the fairy renewed her assurances to her that she would always watch over me . and protested that i had only to wish , and to see the accomplishment of my desires . she added that my misfortunes would shortly end , provided neither the queen nor i raised up an obstacle by some act of imprudence . all these promises could not console my mother , she wished to remain with me .
woe is me , singing mouse . and these are bitter tears for that which you have shown i see it all again . the oaks , the glade , the tiny house of white . the small pleasant fire , here again is the little table , and here is the evening meal . the table is still spread for two , a double portion is served as was wont before , yet why ?
yes , it was delightful ; and the little [male] showed the boy everything . and the elder tree still was fragrant , and the red flag . with the white cross , was still waving : the flag under which the old seaman in the new booths had sailed . and the boy grew up to be a lad , and was to go forth in the wide world far . far away to warm lands , where the coffee tree grows ; but at his departure the little [male] took an elder blossom from her bosom .
but the dragon was already climbing up , [male] , whom his master 's magic had rendered invisible . threw the dragon to the ground with his armlet . and began to pitch into him , the dragon scolded and screamed , `` there the old worm flounders about , '' said [male] , `` and does not care how hard he is beaten , i will scratch off some of his scales . '' and with these words he began to tear open the dragon 's festal garments .
`` come in , '' said the old king , when [male] knocked at the door . [male] opened it , and the old king came forward to meet him in his dressing gown and embroidered slippers . he wore his crown on his head . and bore his scepter in one hand and his ball in the other . `` wait a bit , '' said he , putting the ball under his arm .
she was three times the height of an ordinary man . it was said , her hair was like knotted ropes . her eyes flamed fire ; when she blew her nose . the sound was like thunder ; when she sneezed . forests swayed as beneath a hurricane .
and she sang gayly as they floated in the clear air . while her friend kept time with his waving wings . and ever as they went along all grew [male] ; and thus they came to fairy land . as [female] passed through the gates , she no longer wondered that the exiled fairies wept and sorrowed for the lovely home they had lost . bright clouds floated in the sunny sky , casting a rainbow light on the fairy palaces below .
on reaching the lake the king told the fisherman to catch the fish . but he went on himself to examine the place . the farther he went the thicker the grass . till at last he had hard work to get through . still he advanced till he came to a beautiful green meadow .
at length the love of the couple grew to such a pitch that they determined to please themselves . and to seek their fortunes together , so one moonlight night they stole away . and ventured out into an unknown world , all day long they marched bravely on through the [male] . till they had left their homes far behind them . and towards evening they found themselves in a large park .
once upon a time there lived a man south of the yangtze kiang . he had taken a position as a teacher in sutschoufu . on the border of shantung , but when he got there he found that the schoolhouse had not yet been completed . yet a two-story building in the neighborhood had been rented , in which the teacher was to live and hold school in the meantime . this house stood outside the village , not far from the river bank .
he found him at the door of the brufir 's . and they drank bowls of milk and ate oaten bread together . and then went to the gate of the town to watch the notable people who were coming in . and with the bards and harpers and kings envoys who came in , the king 's son saw his two half brothers .
she commended his [male] , and extolled him above all the heroes in the world . he returned her compliments . and she appeared still more lovely to him near , than she had done at a distance . i know not whether she felt more joy at being delivered from the desperate danger she had been in . than he for having done so considerable a service to so beautiful a person .
all the three promised not to quarrel , the pheasant was now made a member of [female] 's suite . and received half a cake , [male] 's influence was so great that the three became good friends . and hurried onwards with him as their leader . hurrying on day after day they at last came out upon the shore of the north eastern sea . there was nothing to be seen as far as the horizon -- not a sign of any island .
far away to the west loom the goblin haunted heights of oyama . and beyond the twin hills of the hakoné pass . fuji yama , the peerless mountain , solitary and grand , stands in the centre of the plain . from which it sprang vomiting flames twenty one centuries ago , for a hundred and sixty years the huge mountain has been at peace . but the frequent earthquakes still tell of hidden fires , and none can say when the red hot stones and ashes may once more fall like rain over five provinces .
whereupon she upset the pan into the fire and departed as she had come . the vizier , perceiving that so strange an event might no longer be kept from the royal knowledge . went and informed the sultan of all that had occurred ; and the monarch , as soon as he had heard the tale . now rendered more eager for the satisfaction of his eyes than he had previously been for the indulgence of his appetite . sent for the fisherman , and promised him yet another four hundred pieces of gold if he could within a given time procure four more fishes similar to those he had already brought on the previous occasions .
she sighed , and turning to her husband said , `` i wish i had as many children as there are icicles hanging there . '' `` nothing would please me more either , '' replied her husband . then a tiny icicle detached itself from the roof . and dropped into the woman 's mouth , who swallowed it with a smile . and said , `` perhaps i shall give birth to a snow child now , '' her husband laughed at his wife 's strange idea .
this my poor brother had not expected ; already , before this , he had determined to go in search of his sister and her friend . after having asked the blessing of his father upon his efforts . and now that father had sent him forth into the world . laden with his curse , as , however , his former grief had bowed him down . so this consummation of misfortune , which he had not deserved .
when people are too well off they always begin to long for something new . and so it came to pass , that the bird , while out one day . met a fellow bird , to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements . but the other bird sneered at him for being a poor simpleton . who did all the hard work , while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it .
on saying this , the fairy touched [female] with her magic wand . and her clothes were instantly changed into a most magnificent ball dress , ornamented with the most costly jewels . the fairy now took from her pocket a beautiful pair of elastic glass slippers . which she caused [female] to put on ; and when she had thus completed her work . and [female] stood before her , arrayed in her beautiful clothes .
`` somebody with a capital s , '' mused [female] , as she gazed into the dying fire . `` i wonder , '' but just then the bell rang announcing the return of her step sisters , oh ! they were full of it , a most beautiful princess had been to the ball . they said , and they had actually spoken with her .
once more the bird grew and grew till it was large enough for him to mount it . as he did so , the bird spread its wings and flew swiftly out across the sea in the direction of [location] . lo , and behold , [male] was awakened by his own screams . to find that during his long prayer he had fallen asleep before the shrine . and that all his extraordinary and frightful adventures had been only a wild dream , he was in a cold perspiration with fright .
by accident , [female] was in the market . and as soon as he saw the horse , and had narrowly examined him . he at once discovered that it was a magic horse . he therefore withdrew unperceived from the crowd , and hastened home . disguised himself as a merchant , and provided with an ample sum of money .
under the tree is the home for me . here will i sleep , through the lonely night , while the cold dews weep . in the pale starlight , first fairy , why , it is not edith . yet she has on her purple dress , second fairy . an elf has crept into fairyland ; bid her bide .
gerda was obliged to rest again , and just opposite the place where she sat . she saw a great crow come hopping across the snow toward her . he stood looking at her for some time , and then he wagged his head and said . `` caw , caw ; good day , good day , '' he pronounced the words as plainly as he could . because he meant to be kind to the little girl .
at these words the giants understood that their prize had escaped . and they ran after the fox as fast as their great legs could carry them . thinking that they should soon come up with the fox , who they supposed had the princess on his back . the fox , on his side , was far too clever to choose the same path that his friends had taken . but would in and out of the forest , till at last even he was tired out .
it was the bridegroom 's third matrimonial undertaking . and the bride 's second , when the clergyman on whom they had called for the ceremony entered the parlor . he found the couple comfortably seated , they made no effort to rise . so , as he opened the book to begin the service . he directed them , `` please , stand up . ''
the prince went to dress for the occasion , for he was resolved to die like a prince . when the princess heard that a man had offered to die for her . she was so transported that she jumped off the bed . feeble as she was , and danced about the room for joy . she did not care who the man was ; that was nothing to her .
some men are born to good luck : all they do or try to do comes right . all that falls to them is so much gain -- all their geese are swans . all their cards are trumps -- toss them which way you will . they will always , like poor [person] , alight upon their legs . and only move on so much the faster , the world may very likely not always think of them as they think of themselves .
then there were feasts and fireworks in every street in the town . and early the next morning the fairy , who had been all over the world in the night . brought back with her in her flying chariot the most handsome and good tempered prince she could find anywhere . he was so charming that [male] loved him from the moment their eyes met . and as for him , of course he could not help thinking himself the luckiest prince in the world .
and how her delight increases as he approaches . the nearer he comes , the more her heart opens to the divine sun of heaven . she feels as if she could draw its radiations down upon him . she waits at the window to catch his first glad look of recognition . then she flies to the door , and no sooner is it opened and closed again .
[male] was deeply interested ; his heart beat fast . [male] became more and more interesting , wrapped round in a web of romance . he wanted to ask more questions of mother [female] . but she faded slowly away , as she vanished , a voice said . `` adieu , follow the light path , and nothing can molest you . ''
but as soon as the cook began to butter them the palace shook as in a tempest . then came a shock as from a lightning stroke , and in an instant all present received such slaps on the face that they fell senseless to the floor . while lying there without distinction of persons none of them knew . not even the king , that one of the fish stood on its tail in the pan and said to the other two . `` will ye serve me or be food for the king ? ''
his faith had grown strong in the poor fisherman 's cottage . the light which had never shone into his father 's mind . in all the richness and [male] of [location] . was sent to him to be his comfort in poverty and distress . a sign of that [male] of god which never fails .
once upon a time there was a mill , in which it was impossible to grind flour . because such strange things kept happening there , but there was a poor woman who was in urgent need of a little meal one evening . and she asked whether they would not allow her to grind a little flour during the night . `` for heaven 's sake , '' said the mill owner . `` that is quite impossible , there are ghosts enough in the mill as it is . ''
the place itself was simple enough -- a rugged block of stone . beneath which murmured a little rivulet , and a wild cherry tree which overshadowed the stone with its leafy branches . were all that was to be seen there ; but the youth felt happy when he spread his meal upon that stone . and drank from that streamlet , when , after having partaken of his meal . he stretched himself to rest upon the stone .
his wife at length became more reconciled to the loss . considering that after all he had done right to make peace between their neighbours sons at any cost , not many minutes after . the parents of the two lads came to thank the man for having separated the boys . they also thanked him for the money he had given to the boys .
while the chariot , swaying from side to side , tossed him to and fro . still the prince followed close behind , but still found no opportunity to strike , nor , indeed . had he need , for coming to some rocky ground , the horses overset the chariot . and the sultan was torn in pieces by his own contrivance of scythes and hooks . then the prince took up his shield and armour from where they lay .
but the yellow cap of stifling smoke came down upon him and shut him in . he sank downwards , choking and gasping ; and he heard . ringing through the heated air , a sound of laughter that reminded him of [male] . [male] opened his eyes , which felt dry and hot , it was indeed [male] . who was laughing , and bidding him wake up , for it was past eight o'clock in the morning .
then [female] brought them to a thicket beside the war god 's gate . and there she bade [female] dig a ditch . and kill the lamb , and leave it there , and strew on it magic herbs and honey from the honeycomb . then sprang up through the earth , with the red fire flashing before her . [female] the wild witch huntress , while her mad hounds howled around , she had one head like a horse 's .
there were square boxes , too—the kind that have crackers in—with a cracker going off on the lid . very different in size and brightness from what it does really . for , as no doubt you know , a cracker very often comes in two quite calmly . without any pop at all , and then you only have the motto and the sweet . which is never nice , of course , if there is anything else in the cracker .
and as [female] passed on , the hillside itself dissolved in mist . and there before her lay the fairy grove . and the guardian of the grove , with white beard sweeping the ground . and old [female] hands , came out to meet her , and she showed him her feather . and from his belt he drew out and held up its fellow .
it was an ice cold morning , and the mist mounted from the black ravine . [female] sat there like a fly on a rocking blade of grass . which a nest building bird has dropped in its hasty flight , on the edge of a factory chimney . but the fly had the advantage of escaping by its wings . poor [male] had none , he was almost sure to break his neck .
he felt that [male] was all he had to love now . he took her in his arms and kissed her . oh , unhappy [female] , [female] , too , had become hard , shining gold . there were the tears still on her cheeks ; they were little lumps of gold now . everything was the same , even the pretty [female] in her chin .
the king and queen had begged the lady in waiting to take the greatest of care of their dear daughter . and above all to be heedful that she did not see the light of day until her fifteenth birthday . saying that the ambassador had promised that until then she should be placed where there was no other light than that of candles . but now as they drew near their destination , while it was broad daylight the wicked woman . urged by her envious daughter , [female] epine .
she applied herself to magic , and when she had learnt enough of that diabolical art to execute her horrible design . the wretch carried my son to a desolate place . where , by her enchantments , she changed him into a calf . and gave him to my farmer to fatten , pretending she had bought him . her enmity did not stop at this abominable action , but she likewise changed the slave into a cow .
feeling ran high on the day of the race ; the goose rushed at the fox and nearly pecked him . both sides spoke loudly of the approaching victory up to the very moment of the race . `` i am absolutely confident of success , '' said the tortoise , but the [male] said nothing . he looked bored and cross , some of his supporters deserted him then and went to the other side . who were loudly cheering the tortoise 's inspiriting words .
down in a green and shady bed a modest violet grew ; its stalk was bent . it hung its head , as if to hide from view . and yet it was a lovely flower , its color bright and fair . it might have graced a rosy bower instead of hiding there , yet there it was content to bloom . in modest tints arrayed ; and there diffused its sweet perfume within the silent shade .
one night after every one was asleep , princess [female] rose and slipped softly down the stairs and out of the palace unheard by any one . and stole away to the wizard 's cave , the old man was sitting on his low stool reading out of an immense book by a dim green light . but he raised his eyes as the princess entered at the low doorway . and looked at her , she wore a blue and silver robe . but her bright hair was unbound , and fell in ripples to her waist .
adrian found himself at the summit of his wishes . his dwelling was thronged with joyous spirits like himself . who courted and flattered him , always extolling in exaggerated terms his generosity and powers of pleasing . invitations came from far and near , and neighbouring families vied with each other in giving costly entertainments to this charming brother and sister . nor was [male] ever left out of the party , [male] forgot not the injunctions of his patroness .

in the kaffir tale , where the girl disenchants the crocodile by licking him . the man who comes out of the crocodile skin merely says that the girl 's `` power '' is greater than that of `` the enemies of his father 's house , '' who had enchanted him ( theal , the bird who made milk ) . this idea may and does exist apart from the notion , which so commonly accompanies it . of a taboo , or prohibition on freedom of intercourse between the lover and the lady .
now the doctor was so delighted at the news of a patient ( for he was young . and had not many of them ) , that he was transported with joy . `` get a light , '' he called to the servant . `` and follow me as fast as you can , '' and rushing out of his room he ran towards the staircase . there he nearly fell over the body of the hunchback .
`` yes , i will , '' said [female] , so she stood up and showed [female] how to take a long breath . and how to push himself , and then he found he could do it quite well . and when [male] began to float too , they could go along together hand in hand just as they had before . suddenly a thought crossed [male] 's mind . and he cried , `` why , [male] , i thought you were [male] ! ''
gilly of the goatskin wished for wide windows in his house and he got them . he wished for a light within when there was darkness without . and he got a silver lamp that burned until he wished to sleep . he wished for the songs of birds and he had a blackbird singing upon his half door . a lark over his chimney , a goldfinch and a green linnet within his window .
avenant was pleased with the crow 's good feelings and continued his journey . when , some days after , as he crossed a thick wood . he heard an owl hooting . as if in great distress , after looking about him on all sides . [male] found the poor owl had got entangled in a net , he soon cut the meshes .
then there was much rejoicing , and the little swallow , who sat above them . in his nest , was asked to sing a wedding song , which he did as well as he could . but in his heart he felt sad , for he was very fond of tiny . and would have liked never to part from her again , `` farewell , farewell ! '' said the swallow , with a heavy heart as he left the warm countries .
he would have broken the spell and set them free . since [male] had already sung `` and saturday and sunday , ' '' there were so many things in brittany that father wanted to show me . places he had seen with mother . and curious monuments , and lovely views , -- that i could not get out alone again until the day before we went on to normandy . no fairy would ever speak to me unless i was quite by myself .
and scarcely waiting to say good by to his family , away he stumped down the high road that led to [male] . `` be sure that you are kind and civil to every one you meet , '' called his mother , running after him ; but he was in such a hurry to be off that he did not wait to answer her or even to look back . a little later in the day , as he was taking a short cut through a field . he passed a stream , now , the stream was all choked up and overgrown with weeds and water plants .
but chiefly by the presence of his young friend . the hunter 's son , to whom he was fondly attached . the children were never parted from each other ; and when the hunter looked upon the strange boy . he seemed to see living in him the better spirit of his lost wife . he was thankful to the great spirit for this act of goodness .
by this time sir guy had grown to love wandering and fighting so well that he had well nigh forgotten who had sent him from his native land . and why he was not dwelling in his father 's castle . indeed , so wholly had the image of [male] faded from his memory . that when [male] emperor of constantinople . under whose banner he was serving , offered him the hand of his only daughter and half of his dominions .
mustapha , who , concealed behind the coffins , had inspired the attendants with such terror . came forth and lighted a lamp , which he had brought for that purpose . then he drew out a vial which contained the life restoring medicine , and lifted the lid of [male] 's coffin . but what amazement seized him , when by the light of the lamp . strange features met his gaze , neither my sister .
it was after one of these dreadful occurrences one day that [female] . hiding in the woods , heard a strange rustling among the bushes . he was so used to wandering about after old [male] , and living anyhow and anywhere . that he was more like a little creature of the woods himself than anything else . and it took a good deal to frighten him .
after journeying for some days under the wise direction of the wuzeer 's daughter . the party found themselves getting out of the jungle . and at last they came to an open plain , in the middle of which was a large city . when the citizens saw the elephant coming they ran out to see who was on it . and returning , told their rajah that a very handsome rajah .
days slowly elapsed without intelligence of [female] . and the arrangements became gradually completed by which , upon the festival of all saints .

he climbed up the trunk to the top , and as he was about to reach out for an apple . he saw a ring hanging before it . but he thrust his hand through that without any difficulty . and gathered the apple , the ring closed tightly on his arm . and all at once he felt a prodigious strength flowing through his veins .
`` woman , i have you now , '' shrieked the lady [female] , `` and the sword of [female] as well ! '' and she leaped from the garden house and ran at full speed . she stretched forth her hand to catch o [female] by the sleeve . but did not have her or the sword either , for both of them were gone in a flash .
`` stop him , stop him , '' shouted [male] . but the people in the street , seeing a wooden puppet running like a race horse . stood still in astonishment to look at it , and laughed and laughed , at last . as good luck would have it , a soldier arrived who , hearing the uproar . imagined that a colt had escaped from his master , planting himself courageously with his legs apart in the middle of the road .
the steed then told [female] to go into the town and get for himself a snow white tent . and all manner of [male] and gold and silver ornaments . he was to purchase beside a golden pitcher of rare wine and a sleeping potion . [male] did all that the steed bade him . he bought the tent and the wares .
he had quite forgotten his warlike guest and why king victor had come to [male] . indeed , for the moment every one seemed to have forgotten red rex , the librarian . the lord mayor , and the other leading citizens had disappeared . and the library seemed quite empty , but in one corner of the alcove where the last story had been read . red rex was standing at bay , he had drawn up before him a heavy table .
perhaps you think that fishes were always fishes . and never lived anywhere except in the water , but if you went to australia and talked to the black people in the sandy desert in the centre of the country you would learn something quite different . they would tell you that long , long ago you would have met fishes on the land . wandering from place to place , and hunting all sorts of animals . and if you consider how fishes are made , you will understand how difficult this must have been and how clever they were to do it .
lillekort was summoned , and , as he had said , he once . twice , thrice let some drops of wine fall in [male] 's plate . the first time he was struck the coarse garments he wore fell off . and the valiant boy appeared in a suit of bronze armour . the second time in silver armour , and the third time in armour of glittering gold .
`` do n't be so sure about that , '' as for the woman and her child . the black douglas would not suffer any one to harm them , after a while they went back to [location] . and whether the mother made up any more songs about the black douglas i can not tell . there is a town in [location] called go tham . and many merry stories are told of the [female] people who used to live there .
but [female] was quite real ; only her mother , who knew something of magic . had given her the power of stepping in and out of people 's dreams just as she chose . [female] got up and went on his way , thinking of [male] all the time . it was still very hot , and he grew so thirsty that he went to a little hut by the roadside . and asked an old woman who was sitting in the doorway to give him a drink .
he stole [male] 's dress of falcon feathers . then as a falcon he flew out of [male] . [male] was the place that he flew toward . the anger and the fierceness of the hawk was within [male] as he flew through the giants ', realm . the heights and the chasms of that dread land made his spirits mount up like fire .
today 's reader may well wonder why the three clerks was ever rated higher than the warden and [female] towers . posterity has certainly not concurred , in the case of [female] 's novels . religion , like politics , has trumped bureaucracy . the book , however , primarily tells the story of six young people . i must confess that i found myself tiring of them before the author did .
no indeed , he was soon well again , and fought many brave battles and did many brave deeds to please the king . suppose you are dressed for walking , and the rain comes pouring down . will it clear off any sooner because you scold and frown ? and would not it be nicer for you to smile than pout . and so make [male] in the house when there is none without ?
her godmother only just touched her with her wand . and , at the same instant , her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver . all beset with jewels , this done , she gave her a pair of glass slippers . the prettiest in the whole world , being thus decked out , she got up into her coach . but her godmother , above all things , commanded her not to stay till after midnight .
they smiled , and had already brought the basin , the phials . and the metal mirror , but [male] stopped them with an imperious gesture . and lowered his eyes that he might not look upon them . for they were naked , [male] brought cushions for him . and offered him various meats and drinks .

the music was furnished mostly by the musical soup eaters . they marched with big bowls of soup in front of them and big spoons for eating the soup . they whistled and chuzzled and snozzled the soup and the noise they made could be heard far up at the head of the procession where the spoon lickers were marching . so they dipped their soup and looked around and dipped their soup again . the [person] chubs were next , they were roly poly .
fair [female] stood and looked at her , and her heart grew cold within her . and she could stir neither hand nor foot . then the witch turned and walked down the crag , and back to her own home . but the fair [female] was changed in her shape so that even her own father would have feared her . her shape grew long , her breath was fire .
the most natural , simplest , and undoubtedly the most successful [person] of the grain is the presence of a person on the terrace walls of the sementera . whether by day or night , hundreds of fields are so guarded each day in [person] by old people and children . who frequently erect small screens of tall grass to shade and protect themselves from the sun . the next simplest method is one followed by the boys . they employ a hollow section of [organization] .

historians relate that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries . at certain gala feasts , the dishes were brought in by servants in full armour . mounted on caparisoned horses ; but this is a custom exclusively attached to chivalry , as early as those days . powerful and ingenious machines were in use , which lowered from the story above . or raised from that below , ready served tables , which were made to disappear after use as if by enchantment .
the lovely [female] wept in her room over her husband 's ill nature . and she often wished she were back again in her father 's mean cottage instead of having to live in the house of the rich . avaricious and hard hearted [female] , even had she known that he had a heart of marble . and could never love anybody , not even herself , she would not have been so greatly surprised . whenever she sat in the porch and a beggar passed by .
tangle followed the serpent , but she could not go far without looking back at the [male] child . he stood alone in the midst of the glowing desert . beside a fountain of red flame that had burst forth at his feet . his naked whiteness glimmering a pale rosy red in the torrid fire , there he stood . looking after her , till , from the lengthening distance .

the turret chamber was his home henceforth . and all through the long winter [male] 's children loved to gather there at twilight . and coax the merry goblin to join them in their games . or tell them tales of the old days of the castle . but perhaps their mother 's story was the one that they loved best .

but no theory is so plausible , or is supported by such names , as that which deduces the english fairy from the persian [person] . it is said that the paynim foe . whom the warriors of the cross encountered in [location] . spoke only arabic ; the alphabet of which language , it is well known . possesses no p , and therefore organically substitutes an f in such foreign words as contain the former letter .
no sooner was the jackal set free than he began to think what he could do to earn a livelihood . since he did not dare return to the [male] 's house . it was not long before a feasible plan struck him . all around was the mud made by the recent rain ; he placed a quantity of it in a small chattee . covered the top over carefully with leaves ( as people do jars of fresh butter ) .
the months went by , and rainbow searched everywhere , she searched all through the summer . and although she met many kind faces , and saw many a happy smile . and heard many a young voice , nowhere did she meet any one who in the least reminded her of blue eyes . when the winter came , they went to a city . and blue boy , who was growing up into a big boy , was apprenticed to a glass mender .
anguish seized him , and a weakness greater even than he had felt before the sword of flames in the hands of prince [male] . he gave a hoarse cry to his servants for help . but they , voiceless and motionless prisoners in their vaulted chamber . could not answer , could not come to him , although they heard him call . he tried to struggle to his feet , but it was quite in vain .
it is to my good godmother that i owe them , ', replied [female] . and then she told prince [male] how she had been educated on a farm and that she was indebted to the fairy puissante for everything that she knew and everything she valued . the fairy had watched over her education and granted her every wish of her heart .

next day , as [female] traveled to the village across the plain . where he intended to present a toy squirrel to a [male] boy . he was suddenly set upon by the awgwas , who seized him and carried him away to the mountains . there they thrust him within a deep cavern and rolled many huge rocks against the entrance to prevent his escape . deprived thus of light and food , and with little air to breathe .

if he abstains he is very likely before long dismissed , but if he indulges he straightway loses the will and the power ever to return to the society of men . he becomes insensible to the passage of time . and may stay , without knowing it , for years , and even ages . in the brugh , many , who thus forgot themselves , are among the fairies to this day . should they ever again return to the open air , and their enchantment be broken .
when the old man finished telling his story , he went away chuckling to himself . and every one laughed at his joke , every one , that is , but [male] . who went towards his uncle 's house slowly , thinking , thinking , thinking about the underground river . next morning [male] set to work at once to explore the blue lake . first he made a map of that part of the country .

the next day , about noon , a policeman brought me the following note . written in pencil , on a leaf torn from a pocket book . i made a speech last night in behalf of oppressed humanity . but its effect upon my audience was , to say the least , singular , its results . as far as i am personally concerned were also somewhat unpleasant , looking at myself in my pocketglass this morning .
at first the miller stared at him for a madman . but when he saw the letter in [male] 's hands which the king had written . and which said , `` i will cut off your head if you do not !

although he was so very handsome , still there was a something about him that they did not like at all . but the knight had overcome all who had chosen to come against him , and his trumpets were sounding the challenge for the last time . and then their echoes died away and still no answering trumpet came , and the princess was beginning to feel afraid that he had gone off to [location] and left her . but just as the knight was advancing to claim his rights , a trumpet blast rang out brazen and shrill on the still air . and the prince of [location] rode into the lists .
`` woe to you and to me , '' replied the count , with pale lips , `` i heard the giants '' cries of rage , and hoped you were paying for your disobedience with your life . but it has happened otherwise , and now i and my daughter must suffer because you . you insolent fellow , disobeyed my commands and entered the giants ', territories .
after breakfast next morning the princes intended to play with the animals of the [male] 's ark again . but no amount of wishing would bring them down from their resting place . for morning is the time for lessons . not for toys , while they were still standing in front of the cupboard . looking up at the ark and wishing their hardest , the stick came in and drove them out of the room .
his daughters were all beautiful , but his youngest one was especially admired , and from the time she was a small child . had been only known and spoken of as `` beauty , '' the name remained with her as she grew older . which gave rise to a great deal of jealousy on the part of her sisters . the young girl was not only more beautiful than they were , but also kinder and more amiable . the elder daughters gave themselves great airs .
`` most joyfully will we do our best , dear queen , '' said the elves . as they folded their wings beside her , in a large and pleasant garden sat little [female] all alone . and she seemed very sad , for drops that were not dew fell fast upon the flowers beside her . who looked wonderingly up , and bent still nearer , as if they longed to cheer and comfort her . the warm wind lifted up her shining hair and softly kissed her cheek .
who cried out , `` a miracle , a miracle , the dead is raised to life ! '' while i made my escape in the throng . but being fearful that the many tricks i had played , especially this last , might excite inquiry . and lead to a discovery , i fled from the city . and resolved to remain in this cave till curiosity should subside .
little mice ran about the floor , dragging the nettles to her feet . to help as much as they could ; and a thrush , sitting outside the grating of the window . sang to her the whole night long as sweetly as possible , to keep up her spirits . it was still twilight , and at least an hour before sunrise . when the eleven brothers stood at the castle gate and demanded to be brought before the king .
without a moment 's hesitation the clown grasped the black outstretched hand . the bird screamed , `` swan , hold fast , '' called out [female] . and the clown became the fourth of the party , now in the front row of the spectators sat the respected and popular mayor of the village . who was much put out by what he considered nothing but a foolish trick . so much annoyed was he that he seized the clown by the hand and tried to tear him away .
when they approached the great entrance to the castle there was hurried running to and fro on the ramparts . about the doors and windows , and in the halls . eager eyes looked down from the watch tower , but soon all eagerness changed to alarm . they could all see that the giant had been smitten dreadfully : that the proud yet kindly head had been brought low . silence reigned in the great reception hall when the giant entered .
the barn was tremendously big , a great dusty place full of the smell of hay . ahead of him were two stalls , with a horse in one . but [male] was most interested in the empty stall , for it was from there the laughter seemed to come . he stood looking and listening , and then right down through the ceiling of the stall shot a child . and landed laughing and squealing in the hay in the manger .
he sat till the clock struck twelve . and then , taking courage , began to think he might as well look about him . so he opened a door at the end of the hall . and went through it into a very grand room , in which there was a fine bed . and as he was feeling very weary , he shut the door .
this shocking disturbance caused the vicar and his eight kind curates to faint . while the duke , who , now having lost all interest in the proceedings . was only waiting to give away the prizes , turned quite white , and at once drove off with the duchess in his motor . and never again referred to the subject , the general stripped off his medals in despair . and gave them away to the children to cut their teeth with .
he reached the edge of the people and crossed the open space beyond . passing the leaping blaze of the fagots , and so drew near the iron door of the pit . the key went slowly into the lock , all shrank with dismay at the roar which rent the air . [male] paused with his hand gripping the key . and there came a sound of solemn singing over the fields .
it so happened , however , that when the rajah came to visit his wife . as chance would have it , he went through this very room . and tripping over the upturned basket , called for a light to see what it was . then , lo and behold , there lay the statue of a dog . life size , composed entirely of diamonds , emeralds , and other precious stones .
on the other side of the lake the garden boy saw a beautiful castle splendidly illuminated . whence came the lively music of fiddles . kettle drums , and trumpets , in a moment they touched land . and the company jumped out of the boats ; and the princes . after having securely fastened their barques , gave their arms to the princesses and conducted them to the castle .
cuddy was now wide awake , and felt , when he got up . his joints sadly cramped , which it was only natural they should be . considering the hard texture of the stone , and the depth his knees had sunk into it . but the great difficulty was to explain how , in one night , summer had become winter . whole woods had been cut down , and well grown trees had sprouted up , the miracle .
so her envious heart had as much repose as an envious heart can ever know . when the dwarfs came home in the evening . they found [female] lying breathless and motionless on the ground . they lifted her up , searched whether she had anything poisonous about her . unlaced her , combed her hair .
so there was no more running into the sea just when and how they liked . they had to use the bathing machine . and it smelt of stale salt water and other people 's wet towels . but one day [female] had pulled a lot of white convolvulus and some pink geraniums and calceolarias—the kind you are never allowed to pick at home—and she had made a wreath of them and put it on her head . and she had , a large stiff hat that hurt her head just where the elastic was sewn on .
ivan saddled his good steed , gave him a bridle of embroidered ribands . put a tcherkess saddle on his back . and buckled ten rich silken girths around him . then he vaulted into the saddle , struck him on the flank . and the horse chafed at the bit .
' i am going to the house of mark the merchant . and have a letter for his wife , replied [male] . [male] saw the bearer of the letter and he pleased her very much . they dressed [female] in fine clothes and next day he was married to [male] . in due time , mark returned from his travels .
when his mother saw him enter the house she wept for joy . for she had feared that the fairies had carried him away . or that the giant had found him , but [female] put the brown hen down before her . and told her how he had been in the giant 's castle . and all his adventures , she was very glad to see the hen .
once there lived a peasant and his wife who had three daughters . the two elder girls were cunning and selfish ; the youngest was simple and open hearted . and on that account came to be called , first by her sisters and afterward by her father and mother . `` little simpleton , '' little simpleton was pushed about , had to fetch everything that was wanted . and was always kept at work ; but she was ever ready to do what she was told .
the woman lied daily and hourly in his sight , and made him do the same . and she took all she could lay hold of in any way . and beat him if he did not follow her example . and although [female] 's instructions had opened a new world on the child 's mind . the evil habits were not so soon got rid of , so there the mischief was .
the world called her the [female] de ', medici . by her side were statues of stone . in which the spirit of life breathed ; figures of men . one of whom whetted his sword and was named `` the grinder '' ; fighting gladiators . for whom the sword had been sharpened , and who strove for the goddess of beauty .
to complete the resemblance , her flock of sheep appeared . grazing round her , and she found a gay crook adorned with flowers upon the bank of the river . quite tired out by so many new and wonderful experiences , the princess sat down to rest at the foot of a tree . and there she fell fast asleep , now it happened that it was in this very country that prince peerless had been set down . and while the princess sunbeam was still sleeping peacefully , he came strolling along in search of a shady pasture for his sheep .
he then carried her into the shed , and she looked around eagerly to see what a palace might be like inside . and it was full of flickering lights and shadows and the scent of burning wood . and she did not see how poor and dirty the room was ; for the firelight gleamed upon a mass of golden fruit and silver bloom embroidered on the covering of the settle by the hearth . and sparkled against a silver and [location] hanging in the chimney . and between the cracks on the walls young [female] had stuck wands of gold and silver palm and branches of snowy blackthorn .
immediately she fixed her eyes upon me . and in watering the flowerpot with a hand whiter than alabaster . looked upon me with a smile , that inspired me with as much love for her as i had formerly aversion for all women . after having watered her flowers , and darted upon me a glance full of charms that pierced my heart . she shut the window , and left me in inconceivable perplexity .
when it gets there it finds our old friends the sun beams hard at work . if you have ever tried to grow a plant in a cellar . you will know that in the dark its leaves remain white and sickly . it is only in the sunlight that a beautiful delicate green tint is given to them . and you will remember from lecture ii .
as they sat by the ashes , numb with the cold . all of a sudden a new warmth filled the lodge , the south wind gently opened the door . and a young chieftain , with a face like the sun , entered . he saw the dying hunter and the boy . and he warmed them back to life .
she had scarcely done speaking before the black appeared . he was of monstrous bulk , and of a dreadful aspect . mounted on a large tartar horse , and bore a heavy cimeter . that none but himself could wield , the prince seeing him . was amazed at his gigantic stature , directed his prayers to heaven to assist him .
then a voice came from the bough , and [female] heard the words it said . and bade [female] play upon the harp . while the heroes waited round , holding the pine trunk rollers . to help her toward the sea , and the good ship [male] heard him . and longed to be away and out at sea ; till she stirred in every timber .
`` how well you remember my song , '' said the pretty girl . waving her hand to [male] as he rode away . he had gone but a short distance when he heard the clatter of hoofs . looking back , he was startled to see a horse and wagon come tearing down the road . `` a runaway , '' he exclaimed , quickly drawing to one side .
`` say on , i will do them , '' replied the prince . and the giant left the house , and bade him follow to the byre . where the cows were kept , all day long the youth toiled . but he might as well have tried to empty the ocean , at length . when he was so tired he could hardly move , the giant 's youngest daughter stood in the doorway .
so then [organization] came to fetch his wife , and they went back to the palace in the hill . and that night she lit the candle . while her husband was asleep , and then she saw that he was a handsome prince . and she felt quite in love with him . and gave him a soft kiss , but just as she kissed him she let three drops of tallow fall upon his shirt .
their mother said , that the gentleman was agreeable in his conversation and manners . that the ugliness of his face , and the blue beard . were defects which they would soon be reconciled to from habit . that his immense riches would procure them every luxury their heart could desire . and he was so civil , that she was certain the scandalous reports about his wives must be entirely without foundation .
as she stood there shivering in the dark and wondering how to free herself . she heard far away in the bog a voice calling through the night . it was a wailing cry . dying away in despair , she listened and listened , and the repeated cry came nearer . then she heard footsteps -- halting , stumbling and slipping .
the sultan of [location] was incensed against [male] to the highest degree . and said to him in a passion , which he could not restrain . is this the way you requite my condescension to stoop so low as to desire your alliance ? i know how to revenge your daring to prefer another to me , and i swear that your daughter shall be married to the most contemptible and ugly of all my slaves . having spoken these words , he angrily bid the vizier begone .
`` this cornelian , '' said the prince to himself . `` must be something very valuable , or my princess would not carry it with so much care . '' it was [female] 's talisman . which the queen of [location] had given her daughter as a charm . to keep her , as she said , from any harm as long as she had it about her .
the perfume of the island clung to the garments of the hermit for forty days . goodbrendan asked many questions about the mysterious island and at last resolved to visit it and see for himself if all the wonders of which he had heard were really true . accordingly , he built a coracle of wattle covered with hides tanned in oak bark and softened with butter . he loaded it with provisions to last for forty days . then he persuaded some of his disciples to accompany him .
a little voice comes singing ; oh , listen to its song , a little child is pleading for those who suffer wrong . grant them the patient magic that gives eyes to the blind ! oh , well filled hands , be generous , oh , pitying hearts , be kind ! it was a very simple little song , but it proved wonderfully effective . for [female] was so carried away by her own feeling that as she sang the last lines she stretched out her hands imploringly .
the youth could not refuse after that , he was obliged to do as the horse bade him . but the tears dimmed his eyes so that he could scarcely see . he drew his sword and cut off the horse 's head . at once , instead of a coal black steed , a handsome young prince stood before him . the lad could scarce believe his eyes , he stared about him .
then they provided a cloth of silk for to cover these letters in the siege perilous . and the king bade haste unto dinner . it was an old custom of [male] 's court that on this day they should not sit at their meat until they had seen some adventure . as they stood waiting therefor , in came a squire bringing the [male] tidings that beneath at the river there was a great stone . as it were of red marble , floating above the water .
by the direction of [female] , her two brothers conducted all the servants to the dreadful scene of her husband 's cruelties . and then showing them his dead body , related the whole occurrences which had taken place . they all said that his punishment was not adequate to what he deserved . and begged that they might be continued in the service of their [male] . as blue beard had no relations , [male] was sole heir to the whole of his immense property .
after the other gentlemen had treated her harshly , and threatened to put her in the stocks . he interceded for her , and entreated his brother magistrates to let [male] . in this instance , take the place of justice . because she was so young , and perhaps had intended to return the rosary later . finally he bent smiling toward his companions and said something to them in a subdued tone .
the boy stood in the forest , free and unharmed , and could hardly understand how it was possible . but the next morning , when the sun peeped over the hills and awakened [location] . the boy lay sleeping , as usual , in their midst , when he woke and heard them shrieking and cackling their astonishment . he could not help laughing , they were so eager to know what had happened to him that they did not care to go to breakfast until he had told them the whole story . the boy soon narrated his entire adventure with the bears .
some seven miles away in glenmore , and conveyed it home at night . he was accompanied by a man of the name of [male] . [male] asked him if the deer was heavy . and big [male] said he felt as if he had a house on his back . [male] then stuck his pen knife in the deer .
but she bade good-bye to all this ceremony when she got into the water . and so remarkable were its effects upon her , especially in restoring her for the time to the ordinary human gravity . that [male] and [male] agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three years . in the hope that , as the water did her so much good . the earth would do her yet more , but the king had some vulgar prejudices against the experiment .
[female] and [female] both lived in a house . [female] went a leasing and [female] went a leasing , so they both went a leasing . [female] leased an ear of corn . and [female] leased an ear of corn . so they both leased an ear of corn .
so on they went , [female] , the cat . the dog , the goat , the bull . and the rooster , jiggelty jolt , jiggelty jolt , jiggelty jolt , and they went on jiggelty jolting till it was about dark . and it was time to think of some place where they could spend the night . now , after a bit , they came in sight of a house .
and when grey night came down on that part of the sea that bears the name of [male] to this day . still there floated the body of the boy whose dreams had come true . for only a little while had he known the exquisite realisation of dreamed of potentialities . for only a few hours tasted the sweetness of perfect pleasure . and then , by an over daring flight , had lost it all for ever , is it not the oft told tale of those who have followed [male] ?
further and further they went through the very scenes where [male] had spent so many pleasant hours with his child friend . but now , the trees that used to whisper so softly looked down like [male] giants . and the night wind in the branches howled `` flee ! '' suddenly a gleam of light broke on their path with a mild silvery [male] . a [male] of water fell on the wanderer 's ear .
their temple is destroyed , and the crowd which had once pressed beneath its portico as the flock of the living god has become a miserable tribe . restless and unquiet in the present , but full of hope as regards the future . the jewish nation exists nowhere , nevertheless , the jewish people are to be found everywhere . they are wanderers upon the face of the earth . continually pursued , threatened , and persecuted , it would seem as if the existence of the offspring of [person] is perpetuated simply to present to [person] eyes a clear and awful warning of the divine vengeance .
in the center of the lodge stood a large tamarack tree . upon this the woodpecker flew , and commenced going up , turning his head on each side of the tree . and every now and then driving in his [male] , at last he pulled something out of the tree and threw it down . when , behold , a fine fat raccoon lay on the ground . he drew out six or seven more , and then came down and told his wife to prepare them .
the poor wife , turning towards him her dying eyes . begged him to give her one short moment to collect herself . `` no , no , '' said he ; `` commend yourself to heaven , '' and . lifting his arm ... at this moment there was such a loud knocking at the gate that blue beard stopped short . it was opened , and two horsemen were immediately seen to enter , who , drawing their swords .
for surely , since he could not stand against a woman , he would fall an easy prey before [female] . when the [female] should have learned that robbers from turan were broken into the land . and [female] was made yet madder for her words . and he departed from the walls in his wrath . and rode far in his anger , and spread terror in his path .
when he got to the street door . the cock dropped down upon him with his claws and [male] . and what the cat and dog done to him was only a flay bite to what he got from the cock . `` oh , tattheration to you all , you unfeeling vagabones ! '' says he , when he recovered his breath .
so he took a piece of stick . and made some holes in the ground , and put in the beans . that day they had very little dinner . and went sadly to bed , knowing that for the next day there would be none . and [male] , unable to sleep from grief and vexation .
he , at the same time , called his clan together . absolved them from their allegiance , and implored them also to save themselves by flight . and to their honour be it said , one and all spurned the idea of leaving their chief in his old age alone to his fate . exclaiming— `` that death itself was preferable to shame and dishonour. '' to the surprise of all . however , the son , dressed in his best garb , and armed to the teeth .
when he had just finished and was going in again , along came a water carrier . bearing two pails on his shoulders , who seemed to want to help him . but the old man grew annoyed and motioned him off , yet the water carrier insisted on mounting the terrace . so they pulled each other about on the terrace edge , it had been raining . the terrace was slippery , its border high and narrow , and when the old man thrust back the water carrier with his hand .
trembling with excitement , the official took the peach and cut it open . it was large enough for all his guests to have a taste . and such a taste it was , they smacked their lips and wished for more . secretly thinking that never again would ordinary fruit be worth the eating , but all this time the old juggler . magician , fairy or whatever you choose to call him .
switzerland is a wonderful country , full of beautiful snowy mountains . where gleaming ice fields shine , and dark pine forests grow . [male] lived with his aunt and his uncle in a village up among these mountains . he could not remember any other home , for his father and his mother had died when he was a little baby . and his aunt and his uncle , who had not a child of their own .
prince [male] burst into a flood of bitter tears . and rode on still farther , long , long did he ride , at last he came to the dwelling of the sun 's sister . she received him into her house . gave him food and drink . and treated him just as if he had been her own son .
then she turned towards the lofty trees . pressed her face gently against their smooth stems , and looked up at their shining foliage . which rustled softly in the breeze , [female] birds hopped from branch to branch . and threw friendly glances at [female] as at an old acquaintance . was it these feathered songsters that made the sweet music which floated with the sunbeams and the soft spring air all through this lovely place ?
this discourse excited his curiosity to behold so lovely a creature . he repaired to his master , saying , my lord . i understand that the sultan hath a most beautiful daughter , and my soul longs ardently for an opportunity of beholding her . if only for an instant , '' the sage exclaimed , `` what have such as we to do . my son , with the daughters of sovereigns or of others ?
one day he had sent his children with the cart deep into the forest . to fetch brushwood , evening came on , and they did not return , it already began to grow dark . and as they still had not come back , his anxiety increased , and he determined to go in search of them . he had just crossed the threshold , when suddenly he heard a shouting and singing at a distance in the wood , joyous sounds ! it was his dear children , who were dragging and pushing along the little cart .
he went out of the house and set off towards the sun—the direction in which he had seen the eagle fly away with [male] . the sun was setting beyond mount kitesh . and so [male] , always looking at the sun , presently came to mount kitesh , too . there was no one beside [male] to say to him , [male] t go up the mountain , child ! the mountain is full of terrors.
`` shall i do it for you ? '' she suggested . and , jumping out of bed to get her work basket , she set to work at once . it hurts a good deal to have a shadow sewn on to your feet . but [male] bore it bravely , it was the right thing to do . for the shadow held on beautifully , and [male] was so delighted that he danced up and down the nursery watching it making patterns on the floor as he flung his arms and legs about .
next day the princess again called him to bring her a bunch of wild flowers . and when he brought it she immediately clutched at his cap to pull it off . but he held it on with both hands . again she gave him a handful of ducats . but he would not keep them , and gave them to the gardener 's children .
`` did he not speak of rewarding you for your hospitality ? '' her husband persisted , guessing that something had been kept back from him . and [male] shyly told him for what she had asked . fierce was [female] 's anger at her neglect of this opportunity to make him rich . he stormed and raved until poor [male] longed to hide , and when at last his rage had spent itself .
when he arrived there , he found the people running about . and crowding around the ruins of the tower of tears . he passed on , however , to the great audience chamber . and , looking in , saw the king sitting upon his throne behind a velvet covered table . holding an early morning council , and receiving the reports of his officers concerning the damage .
but , as i was saying , every body knew [male] jarvis to be a decent . honest , quiet , hard-working man , who was thriving enough to be able to give his daughter [female] a fortune of ten pounds . and [male] himself would have been snug enough besides , but that he loved the drop sometimes . however , he was seldom backward on rent day , his ground was never distrained but twice . and both times through a small bit of a mistake .
their choice of month seems to me characteristic . i do not think they will be disappointed if the day is a little urban in its murkiness . it is good for a man to be in love with his charge . is it not ? next time some fanatic of west end work . or east end work , or foreign mission work gets hold of you and talks excellent sense about discipline .
so [female] was forced to see the child remain in the fires of purgatory . which hurt her little less than her aching limb , at her entrance into the blue pike pain and mental suffering had driven her to the verge of despair . but the day which began so sorrowfully was followed by an evening of delight . she owed to it her new meeting with [female] . probably the latter , for yesterday she had yearned ardently to reach [location] .
the others , sorely wounded -- for none escaped unhurt . hurried on board ship and put to sea , and horn . bearing the saracen leader 's head on his sword 's point . rode back to the royal palace , here he related to king [male] this first exploit of his knighthood . and presented the head of the foe to the king .
long , long ago , before the romans came into the land and when the fairies ruled in the forest . there was a [female] who lived under an oak tree . when she was a baby they called her [female] . she had four brothers , who loved their younger sister very dearly and did everything they could to make her happy . her fat father was a famous hunter , when he roamed the woods .
the king and queen , who kept their eyes upon him . could not fail to observe this , and returned to the palace much discontented with the termination of the day . [male] , occupied only by his passion , left the lists . forbidding any of his train to accompany him ; and [female] . smarting with grief and jealousy , retired to her apartments .
`` then i will carry you a pickaback , '' said the man , and took him up . just as they arrived in the field , [female] got up and drew herself up to her full height , oh ! it is the evil one , cried the parson . and both he and the man hurried away ; and , behold , the parson ran faster with his [male] legs . through fear and terror , than the countryman could with his sound legs !
i have no more to tell you of [female] and [female] now . except that they both grew up and prospered , and that [female] often tells her little girls the story of her adventure with the fairies . and if anyone who reads this story would like to know more particulars . she is so good natured that i am quite sure she will tell them all about it if they will only take the trouble to ask her when she does not happen to be particularly engaged . to `` live like cat and dog '' has long been proverbial as a description of a state of life in which quarrels and bickerings are of frequent occurrence .
the [male] grew and grew until he became monstrous and a terror in the minds of the dwellers in [male] . not by force could the gods get the fetter upon [male] . so they sent [male] , the servant of [male] . to beguile the [male] into letting it go upon him . [male] came to his lair and stood near him .
great was their joy when they found the treasure castle and the treasure room just as the hunter had described . the chancellor poured the shining gems through his claw like fingers . and the king and the chamberlain threw their arms around each others shoulders and danced a jig as well as their age and dignity would permit . the first fine careless rapture over , they began pouring the treasure into the linen sacks they had brought with them .
all through the night he sought , and with the setting of the moon he was struggling up the mountain . because it seemed to him that he must do some hard thing . and this was hard , in the early dawn he stood on the mountain 's very summit . and knocked at the gate of the deserted castle there , and it was the forsaken castle of his father . the king , whom the princess vista 's father had conquered .
on this , the poor officer appealed piteously to everybody in the tavern . they all declared that they had not seen the prince . nor even had an idea that he was doing them the honour of being in the neighbourhood of their town . more and more offended , and convinced that there was a conspiracy to annoy and insult him . the prince shouted for the landlord , called for his [male] .
the bundle , answering to the name of toodleums . was [female] -- her father 's constant companion . she was an only child , her mother had always been delicate . and [female] was not allowed to be much with her , she even forgot that the invalid at home was ailing rather more than usual today . and that their long drive was to fetch her old friend the doctor for his opinion .
on they marched solemnly , almost in silence , for either with feet or voice the creatures seldom made any noise . by the time they reached the outside of the wood it was morning twilight . into the open trooped the strange torrent of deformity , each one following [female] . suddenly she stopped , turned towards them . and said something which they understood , although to [female] 's ear the sounds she made seemed to have no articulation .
prince [male] and his beautiful wife now lived in joy and prosperity for a time in the palace . and when his father was laid in the grave , not long after this , he obtained the whole kingdom . soon afterwards his mother also departed from this world , now it happened that an enemy declared war against the young king . and , as he foresaw that it would be three years at the least before he could return to his country and his queen . he ordered all his servants who remained at home to guard her most carefully .
so within these statutes of limitation i had perforce to recommence . without further preface , telling the fourth and last tale from guy [male] . immediately upon receiving the message of [male] merrilies . brought by [male] , colonel [male] had sent a carriage to the place designated . [male] and his companion [male] .
one day about noon , while the sheep were mostly lying down . and the shepherd , having left them to the care of the dogs . was himself stretched under the shade of a rock a little way apart . and the princess sat knitting , with prince at her feet . lying in wait for a snap at a great fly .
the [female] did not remain long in the little field , as soon as his tail was cool he flew to the town hall and rang the bell . the citizens knew that they were expected to come there , and although they were afraid to go . they were still more afraid to stay away ; and they crowded into the hall . the [male] was on the platform at one end . flapping his wings and walking up and down , and the end of his tail was still so warm that it slightly scorched the boards as he dragged it after him .
now [male] , unlike most chinese , had never saved money and , therefore , had no home to offer fin fan . he knew , also , that her father had his eye upon a young merchant in montreal . who would make a very desirable son in law , [male] could hardly believe that his daughter was seriously opposed to becoming the wife of such a good-looking . prosperous young merchant as [male] ling . he tried to bring her to reason , but instead of yielding her will to the parental .
it is not our intention that the poet shall versify scientific discoveries . the didactic poem is and will be , in its best form , always but a piece of mechanism . or wooden figure , which has not the true life , the sunlight of science must penetrate the poet . he must perceive truth and harmony in the minute and in the immensely great with a clear eye . it must purify and enrich the understanding and imagination .
and the old man who had spoken of all this shook his head mournfully , and said , forgotten ! ah , yes , everything will be forgotten , and then the conversation turned on other matters . but the youngest child in the room , a boy . with large , earnest eyes , mounted upon a chair behind the window curtains . and looked out into the yard , where the moon was pouring a flood of light on the old gravestone .
the captain , taking her for the king of the isle of ebene . replied , sir , there are fifty great pots of olives . but they belong to a merchant whom i was forced to leave behind . i gave him notice that i staid for him . but he not coming , and the wind presenting .
well , that suited the poor brother , and he was agreed to do as the other said . so by and by they met a grand lord riding along the road with six servants behind him . and would he tell whether [male] or greed were the best for a body in this world ? having been thrice adjudged in the wrong , the poor man is left by the rich man blind upon the highway . that suited the younger brother well enough , and on they jogged until they met a rich merchant driving a donkey loaded with things to sell .
for all classes of mortals are equally beneath them . young and handsome found too much pleasure in her new sensations to endeavour to combat them . she loved fondly , and from that moment only indulged in the happy idea of being loved in return . she did not dare to wake the handsome shepherd . for fear he should remark her agitation .
as soon as they appeared in the presence chamber the king received them with open arms . for in his heart he had no doubt that his wife was the peerless beauty destined to unfasten the collar . and , indeed , if paint and hair dye and magnificent dresses could have ensured her doing so . he would certainly have been right , but , blinded by his love for this wicked woman . he had really no idea that her charms were not her own .
when the poor boy saw that his strength was failing and neither was conquering the other . he called loudly : seize him and throw him on the ground . i can hold out no longer , the prince grasped the dragon . summoned up all his strength , and hurled him on the ground so that his bones cracked and he lay senseless . then he hastily took to flight , ran through the half open gate .
between the rocks at our feet a clear brook came rushing down . throwing before it little showers of spray . which fell like crystal pearls on the water , sailed down the swift eddies and then vanished in the next whirlpool . a couple of orioles in brand-new yellow uniforms . with black epaulets on their shoulders , were busy in the tree over our heads .
afterward they lived in peace and happiness . and if they have not died , they are living still , into the saddle then i sprung . this tale to tell to old and young , once upon a time something extraordinary happened . if it had not happened it would not be told , it was when the wolves lay down to rest with the sheep . and the shepherds feasted in the green fields with emperors and kings .
the jeweller needed no more to convince him fully of the prince of [location] 's violent passion . which [male] thaher had told him of . mere friendship would not make him speak so ; nothing but love could produce such lively sensations . at last the prince 's servant returned , and reported that he had spoken with one of [male] thaher 's servants . who assured him that he had been gone two days to [male] .
the good old man did all in his power to dissuade him . but the prince would not listen to his words , now , however , the hundred years were just ended . and the day had come when [male] rose was to wake up again , when the prince approached the [male] hedge it was in [male] . and was covered with beautiful large flowers which made way for him of their own accord and let him pass unharmed . and then closed up again into a hedge behind him , he went on farther .
his mother was glad to see him again , and much surprised at seeing the hen . which laid them three gold eggs every day . [male] 's mother took them to the next town and sold them . and soon grew quite rich , some time afterwards [male] made another journey up the bean stalk to the giant 's castle . but first he dyed his hair and disguised himself .
she gave a great cry that rang through the room . grey smoke , hurrying down the palace hall . heard it and hastened still faster , without waiting to knock , without even trying the door . she wound herself like a thin gray thread through the keyhole . was on the other side of the door in a moment .
dear little [female] , i will lie down and rest in your garden . here are the lilies of the valley you planted . the moonlight shines down upon them as they lie folded in their green leaves . just as you lay in my arms when you were so ill . and they look out and smile as you smiled at me .
all day long the fight was kept up , and [male] had fired all of his arrows but three , without effect . for the shining manito was clothed in pure wampum . it was only by immense leaps to right and left that [male] could save his head from the sturdy blows which fell about him on every side . like pine trees , from the hands of the manito . he was badly bruised , and at his very wit 's end .
the giant took the trunk upon his shoulder . but the tailor sat down on one of the branches , and the giant . who could not look round , was compelled to carry the whole tree and the tailor also . he being behind , was very cheerful , and laughed at the trick , and presently began to sing the song . `` there rode three tailors out at the gate , '' as if the carrying of trees were a trifle .
and so the miller 's son married the king 's daughter . and there were great rejoicings throughout the land , on the evening of the wedding day a great ball was given . to which princes and noblemen from far and near were invited , [male] opened the ball . wearing for the occasion a pair of boots made of the finest leather . with gold tassels and scarlet heels .
felice sighed , for she liked admiration . and the golden archer said no more about gathering gentians , but went with her to the fair . which was a [male] , for he loved fresh air and solitude . and the crowds , the heat , and the dust made his head ache . then , too , he was not used to fairs , and more than once made [male] uncomfortable by the questions he asked .
forthwith he galloped away with sir [male] until they came to a great forest . and then sir [male] groaned and said he could no further go , and forthwith he fell from his horse in a great swoon . sir [male] went to find water in the wood . and had to go far ere he found it , but presently he saw a clearing . and there was a little hermitage and a stream running by .
you see , she always called the teddy bear the brown teddy bear because the billiken was his first cousin . and had a white teddy bear body ; it was only their colors and their heads that were different . oh , yes , -- and their dispositions ; for the billiken was a supremely cheerful person . while the brown teddy bear was a misanthrope , [male] had always known that he had something very depressing on his mind . and she was planning , now that he had learned to talk , to ask him what it was at the first suitable opportunity .
he sprang up , `` it seems to me , '' he cried , that hosts of demons are around the house . and that they are slaughtering my people , and that the house of [male] is on fire . `` it was but a dream , '' the witch [male] said . then he slept again , and he saw a vision .
[female] 's comrades having drawn up the damsel were much astonished at the sight of her . but having learned from her the whole affair they hoisted up her other sisters . at last they let down the [male] for [male] . but he having this time stowed into the [male] many clothes and a great deal of money . and having likewise seated himself therein , his comrades feeling the weight imagined that it was [male] who sat there .
the whiting and haddock left salt water paddock this dance to be put in . where skate with flat faces edged out some old plaices ; but soles kept their footing . the scollop and oyster their two shells did roister , like castanets flitting . while limpets moved clearly , and rocks very nearly with laughter were splitting . in the height of all these doings , what should there be dancing among the outlandish set of fishes but a beautiful young woman .
gladly did bride [male] go with [male] the warden . and he lifted her beside him on to his horse . as the good steed carried them swiftly past the emperor 's daughter sitting at her window . [female] the warden threw her the keys so skilfully that they caught right on the window latch ! all that night [female] the warden rode on with bride [female] .
thumbelina had to turn the spindle , and the field mouse hired four spiders . who were to weave day and night , every evening the mole visited her and was continually speaking of the time when the summer would be over . then he would keep his wedding day with [male] . but now the heat of the sun was so great that it burned the earth and made it hard , like stone . as soon as the summer was over the wedding should take place .
so she got her boy 's clothes . which her maid stole for her out of the room of one of the scullions . and dressed herself in them , smearing her face and hands with walnut juice . that their whiteness might not betray her , she slipped down by some dark stairs into the kitchen . and joined a company of men who were hard at work on a pile of dead animals .
`` and now we have only one more thing left , '' said the brother . and he threw the mirror behind him . at once the mirror became a hill of glass so steep and smooth that no one could possibly climb it . the sprite tried to run up it , but no sooner had she gone a step or so than she slipped back again . at last , with a shriek of rage , she turned and fled back to her castle .
miss [female] was specially radiant and ready for conversation on this occasion . and her family had fallen into the easier continental habit , allowing the stranger [female] and even the courier [female] to share their table and their talk . in [female] conventionality crowned itself with a [female] and splendour of its own . proud of her father 's prosperity . fond of fashionable pleasures , a fond daughter but an arrant flirt .
when he awoke everything was done , all the trees of the wood were cut up into firewood and arranged in bundles ready for use . he returned to the castle as quickly as he could . and told the fairy that her commands were obeyed , she was even more amazed than she had been before . and asked him again if he had either seen or spoken to the black girl . but the prince knew better than to betray his word , and once more lied freely .
next to her [male] , with his waving hair and bright eye . looked quite handsome , and the soft , clear colour of [female] 's face . who was riding on her other side , was a delicious pleasure to the eye . but nothing was more wonderful than the flow of her fair hair . bound in a ribbon embroidered with three golden lilies .
the little sister went out to the spring that the water sprite showed her . and tried to dip up water , but as fast as she dipped it up it ran out again . for the bucket had no bottom , the brother began to chop at a tree near by . he chopped and he chopped and he chopped . but he could scarcely make a dent , the ax was so blunt .
the queen sat stunned and motionless . but the boat at once shot away from the ship with her . and before long she was out of sight , they soon reached the land which [female] was to rule over . and found all the people sorrowful for the old king 's death . but they became glad when they got [male] back to the court .
at the rising of the moon a wonderful thing came to pass . the people entered the castle of gems . and became beautiful , this was through the power of the magic [male] , now there were no more crooked backs and [male] feet and sightless eyes . and the king looked at these people , who were beautiful as well as good . and declared he would have them live in the castle .
during the day , each went about his or her own work ; but in the evening they sat together . the godmother at the table eating her thick soup and potatoes . upon the table [male] had his own little table and chair opposite her , for his supper . he had a baked grain of wheat . a hash of sunflower seed , or two or three grains of [male] in butter .
now [female] was old enough to be confirmed ; she had new clothes and was to have new shoes also . the rich shoemaker in the city took the measure of her little foot . this took place at his house , in his room . where stood large glass cases , filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots . all this looked charming , but the old lady could not see well , and so had no pleasure in them .
the two men murdered the wine seller and his wife with their bills . and then mounted to the shop , where they opened the coffer . and stole from it one hundred and thirty crowns . eight louis d'ors , and a silver belt . the crime accomplished , they took refuge in the court of a large house .
and so this went on , the blue bird paid visits to [male] every night . and they were as happy as it was possible to be , one evening prince charming flew away to his palace . and brought back lovely diamond bracelets , beautiful [male] necklaces and a sweet little [female] watch . and gave them all to [female] , the queen could not understand how it was that [female] had such lovely jewels and why she looked so happy . so she questioned her about it .
and as she spoke , she took the spindle so eagerly and so quickly . that it pierced her hand . and she sank fainting to the floor , the poor old woman . in the greatest distress , cried for help , people came hurrying from all sides . they dashed water on the princess .
i will take mine ease like all the other animals . so he sulked in his little house for a long time and could not be coaxed or driven to do any work . but as he was a lonely fellow who always lived by himself with very few friends in the world except little children . he soon got tired of this lazy life , for by nature he was industrious and energetic and he always liked to be doing something or prowling alone in the forest . so he said , i must find some work to do or i shall surely lose my wits .
but she never did teach him to be serious , for prince charming did nothing but laugh to the end of his days . this did not , however , matter quite so much as might be supposed , for when one plays all day long with some one who knows everything there is to know . one need not be so very wise oneself , and when the time came for prince charming to rule the country . the queen who sat beside him on the throne was a wise and beautiful [male] in a stiff white frock . so the prince laughed as much as before , and the country was governed with all the wisdom of the fairies .
there was a great deal of talking and laughing and sipping of dew flavoured with [male] . which is the drink fairies like instead of tea . the fairies of the canterbury bells had brought their music too . and gave a great deal of pleasure , it seemed as if the party were going to be a great success . when unfortunately a disaster happened which was talked about for many a day afterwards .
yes , there sat the good fellow eating the bread and macaroni his little daughter had brought for his dinner . and a smile welcomed poor [male] as he sat down beside this only friend to tell his story . [male] growled in his black beard and shook his knife with an awful frown when he heard how the lad had been deserted . then he smiled , patted [male] 's back . thrust the copper basin of food into one hand and a big lump of the brown bread into the other .
when his mother saw him enter the house she wept for joy . for she had feared that the fairies had carried him away . or that the giant had found him , but [female] put the brown hen down before her . and told her how he had been in the giant 's castle . and all his adventures , she was very glad to see the hen .
he rushed at the stranger and tore him down . his breath was soon choked out of him , and no one knew how long his body lay in the forest before the wolves devoured it . he had brought his death on himself . the fugitive was glad to get rid of his convict 's garb and now wore a coat of sheepskin . he also had a gun to protect himself from wild beasts .
`` we can not hide her away in the black ground , '' and they had made a coffin of clear glass . so as to be looked into from all sides , and they laid her in it . and wrote in golden letters upon it her name . and that she was a king 's daughter . then they set the coffin out upon the mountain .
beauty , the youngest , was more polite , and thanked those who asked for her hand . but she was , as she told them . too young as yet , and wished to remain for a few more years as a companion to her father . then , all at once , the merchant lost the whole of his fortune . nothing was left to him but a little house .
the divine [female] , however , weary of the bustle of the court . was anxious to pass a few months in a pleasant mansion a short distance from the capital . she had excluded from it all magnificence . but everything about it was elegant , and of a charming simplicity . nature alone had taken care to embellish the walks .
next , the little old woman pulled off her ragged gown and put on the silk . it was now a most beautiful robe of purple . with a gold border , and it just fitted her . then she took out the little tortoise shell comb , pulled off her cap and threw it into the river . as she combed her hair .
i lifted it up , and saw it covered the head of the stairs . which were also of stone ; i went down , and came into a large room . where there was laid a foot carpet , with a couch covered with tapestry , and cushions of rich stuff . upon which the young man sat with a fan in his hand . i saw all this by the light of two tapers .
and that very day king horn was wedded to the beautiful princess jean . with her father 's blessing , and amid the rejoicings of the people . and prince [male] slunk away . ashamed to look his old playmate in the face , not many months passed ere king horn and queen jean sailed away to reign together in the far east . and never again in the years to come did the diamonds on king horn 's ring grow dull or dim .
`` a murrain seize you for disturbing a holy man in his prayers ! '' muttered [male] savagely , nathless , he was fain to unbar the door in order to keep it from being battered down . then lighting a torch at his fire and whistling for one of his dogs . he strode forth to see who his visitor might be . the figure of a tall knight clad in a black coat of mail .
the king at once spurred on his horse , rode after the dwarf . seized him and he was surprised at his strange appearance . for he was small and ugly , like a [male] , and his hair was as stiff as bean straw . but no matter what the king said to him . he would return no answer , nor say a single word one way or another .
polygyny is usual , and is largely practised , a man will often have two or three . or sometimes even four , wives ; and a chief or rich man may have as many as six . in the case of an ordinary person the wives all live with their husband in the same house . but a chief or rich person may have two or more houses . a man who is already married , and then marries again , goes through a formality .
once more she searched round the room ; then she started at hearing the frog utter a low , painful croak . she sprang from the couch and opened the window hastily ; at the same moment the sun rose . and threw its beams through the window , till it rested on the couch where the great frog lay . suddenly it appeared as if the frog 's broad mouth contracted . and became small and red , the limbs moved and stretched out and extended themselves till they took a beautiful shape .
so [female] tied the [male] to his own horse and rode on . where did he ride ? that i can not tell you . but he rode on fast till he got out of the copper wood . `` stay still , and let me look about , and see what i never have seen before , '' said [male] again to his horse , for in front of him stretched a forest that was far more wonderful .
for three days and three nights he never drew rein . like a spirit the horse flew over mountains and valleys till he came to the borders of the empire . here was a deep , deep trench that girdled it the whole way round . and there was only a single bridge by which the trench could be crossed , [male] made instantly for the bridge . and there pulled up to look around him once more , to take leave of his native land then he turned .
then i had to tell her what the birds were saying to one another ; and she was greatly delighted . and she asked me to go home . and she gave orders to the cook to have breakfast ready at six o'clock in the morning . i did not know why she was going out early , and breakfast was ready in the morning at the hour she appointed . she asked me to go out walking , i went with her .
eleven o clock , he exclaimed in amazement . he threw himself into the [male] saddle . `` this is rather comfortable , '' he exclaimed as he leaned against a high back . how slowly the creature moved , at last they reached a clearing . where a long straight road led directly to castle fortune with its beautiful towers and its windows ablaze with lights .
all at once it seemed as if something had fallen down from the table . [person] looked towards it ; it was the easter wand . which had heard the flowers , it was also very pretty ; upon the top of it was set a little wax doll . which had just such a broad hat upon its head as that which the chancellor wore . the easter wand hopped about upon its three wooden legs , and stamped quite loud , for it danced the mazurka .
the portrait of a little boy in a russian blouse is especially attractive . and a portrait of miss [male] in riding costume is well done . these are but a small number of the portraits by this artist . she is clever in posing her sitters , manages the effect of light with skill and judgement . and renders the various kinds of textures to excellent advantage .
`` there , there , '' said the baron , and cleared his throat , then he kissed her . where were firmness and dignity now ? he let her push him into the chimney corner . and down into a seat ; and then what did this sly , shocking girl do but sit on his knee and tell him nobody ever had such a papa before . and she could never possibly love any one half so much as she loved him . and were not he and she going to have a merry christmas tomorrow ?
but through the power of the blessed sign on his arm earlclair went on unhurt . when he had finished pacing round the ring he stepped boldly on to the enchanted ground . and walked across it ; and what was his astonishment to find that all the ghostly elves and goblins whom he had seen . were lying frozen into tiny blocks of ice , so that he was sore put to it to walk amongst them without treading upon them . and as he approached the marble table the very hairs rose on his head at the sight of the elfin king sitting behind it .
a great many years afterward there was one day a huge hunt in emly . all the lords for miles around were out chasing the wild beasts . and among them was the prince , [male] 's foster father . but the bishop himself was not with them . he did not see any sport in killing poor creatures .
then [male] lowered his hand ; and [male] . who had been [male] all this while like a coward , because he knew that he was in the wrong . let [male] and his mother pass .

having gone into the inn they all three sat down to table , but none of them had any appetite . the fox would also willingly have picked a little , but as his doctor had ordered him a strict diet . he was forced to content himself simply with a [male] dressed with a sweet and [male] sauce . and garnished lightly with fat chickens and early pullets , after the [male] he sent for a made dish of partridges . rabbits , frogs , lizards and other delicacies .
and when they would not do as she bade them . she took out a sword herself to put an end to the children with . but she being a woman and with no good courage . and with no great strength in her mind , she was not able to do it . they went on then west to loch dairbhreach , the lake of the oaks .
[person] and [person] are generally stored in the dwelling . in the second and third stories , since not enough of either is grown to fill an a lang ' . it is said , camotes are sometimes stored in the granary after the harvest of the irrigated fields . often they are put away in the kubkub , the two compartments at either end of the sleeping room on the ground floor of the dwelling . at other times one sees bushels of camotes put away on the earth under the broad bench extending the full length of the dwelling .

in a moment swords were out and a fierce combat was beginning . when a number of [female] 's cavalry . who being lowlanders were always at feud with the highlandmen . rode hastily up , calling on their companions to follow , they had heard that there was a chance of a fight between their corps and the highlanders . nothing would have pleased them better , the baron himself threatened that unless the mac ivors returned to their ranks .
the king was sorely troubled when he saw his precious bride so ill . and at once sent for the fish doctor to come and give her some medicine . he gave special orders to the servants to nurse her carefully and to wait upon her with diligence . but in spite of all the nurses assiduous care and the medicine that the doctor prescribed . the young queen showed no signs of recovery .
down he comes into the town , and the first one whom he meets is the master priest . master [male] comes to y^e town with his fine . fat pig and there falls in with the priest and the provost . now , as i told you before , master [male] had two goats . both of them as black as the inside of your hat at midnight .
the sight that now met his gaze was enough to fill him with an icy fear . the silence of the place was dreadful , and death seemed all about him . the recumbent figures of men and animals had all the appearance of being lifeless . until he perceived by the pimply noses and ruddy faces of the porters that they merely slept . it was plain , too , from their glasses , in which were still some dregs of wine .
when they had gone a part of the way they met two foot passengers . a pin and a needle , they cried `` stop , stop ! '' and said that it would soon be blindman 's holiday . that they could not go a step farther ; that the ways were very muddy . might they just get in for a little ? they had been standing at the door of the tailors
from that time the old gnome had no rest at all . unseen -- wrapped in a cloak of shadows -- he sat for hours while the baby was asleep . fanning the flies away from its little face , when it was restless . he kept the clothes over its tiny feet . drawing them up as fast as the baby kicked them away .
maddened with the heat of the burst egg . he tried to go to the back of the house . when the [male] darted out of a cupboard , and a piece of seaweed . who had joined the party , coming up at the same time , the ape was surrounded by enemies . in despair , he seized the clothes rack .
it was high tide , the blue sea stretched away to the blue sky . [male] 's legs gave way under him . and he knelt on the white sand , just looking and looking at the bigness of it . the [male] of it , the color of it . and listening to the music of it , [female] ran right out into the foam brought in by the breakers .
now , you must know that [female] was her eldest son . whom she loved above all the rest , because he was somewhat carroty . as she herself was , they sat down to supper . and ate with such a good appetite as pleased both father and mother . whom they acquainted how frightened they were in the forest .
according to the lochaber story , the fairies stole a white cow from a farmer . and every night took it back again to pasture on his corn . he chased them with his dog [male] . but they threw bread behind them . which the dog loitered to devour , so that it never overtook the white cow .
he hides his children in a pillar . hoping to conceal them from a devouring bear , whose fur is of iron . the bear finds them and carries them off , a horse and some geese vainly attempt their rescue . a bull calf succeeds , as in the former case , in another variant the enemy is an iron wolf . a king had promised his children a wolf .
the nobleman could refuse her nothing , so he had the vats prepared as she wished . the first with cold milk , the second with warm , the third with milk that was boiling . when all was ready the thrice lovely [female] stepped into the first vat , and when she came out she had changed to an old , old woman . she stepped into the second vat , and she became a blooming young girl . she stepped into the third vat , and when she came out from that she was the most beautiful woman that ever was seen .
if any one at this moment had watched the face of the major as he lay asleep . he would have seen a happy smile pass over the lips of this thin tall man . so happy that the old turk who lay not far from him could not have supported the sight of it . what is the matter with him ? he seems to be having a trembling fit . night hangs over him and covers him with her black veil .
then [male] went to [male] , and he too was glad to make peace with the hero . but when [male] came to [male] he said he would not make peace unless he received from [male] and from [male] all the wide lands that he asked . and [male] and [male] gave him the lands . and forgave him all he had done , then was there at last peace between them . and [male] and [male] built a house in sligo .
impressed by the predominance of the mental factor in stammering . these investigators were particularly impressed by some of the peculiarities mentioned above -- as , the ability of almost every stammerer to speak well when alone or when in a state of abstraction . such peculiarities , they knew from long [person] . bore a strong resemblance to oddities in the behaviour of victims of [location] . psychasthenia , or other psychoneurosis , in all of which disorders there is a tendency for symptoms to disappear when the sufferer 's attention is momentarily withdrawn from them .
and [female] held out her hand on which was [female] 's ring . then [female] knew , all at once , that what [female] said was true , it was [male] that rode through the ring of fire the second as well as the first time . it was he who had struggled with her . taking the ring off her hand and claiming her for a bride . not for himself but for another , and out of disdain , falsely had she been won .
when they reached the palace , everyone was loud in praise of the two lovely little dogs the elder brothers had brought back with them . but when the youngest opened his acorn and showed a tiny dog , lying upon a white satin cushion . they knew that this must be the prettiest little dog in the world . however , the king did not feel inclined to give up his throne just yet . so he told the brothers that there was one more task they must first perform .
[male] secrets but the man who 's [male] and discreet . a secret 's ever safely placed with honest fold and leal . for me , my secrets i preserve within a locked up house . whose key is lost and on whose door is set the cadi 's seal . if any share with me in her i love .
but none of the animals that went to the miller 's wedding ever came back . and because they were self willed and conceited , and would not listen to good advice . they and their children have been the servants of men to this very day . several hundreds of years ago there lived in a forest a wood cutter and his wife and children . he was very poor , having only his axe to depend upon .
from that time the pair became intimate friends . the clergyman yielding , with all the ardour of youth . to the attraction which drew him towards the learned old man . and [male] gradually growing to love the pale faced student , whose thirst after knowledge was as intense as his own . seldom a day passed on which one of them might not have been observed on his way to the abode of the other .
the second , that she should have wit like an angel . the third , that she should be perfectly graceful ; the fourth , that she should sing like a nightingale . the fifth , that she should dance perfectly well ; the sixth , that she should play all kinds of music perfectly . then the old fairy 's turn came , shaking her head spitefully . she uttered the wish that when the baby grew up into a young lady .
it is best to be candid , i frankly admit that i never very clearly understood for what purpose she constantly carried that particular utensil . but she placed it , however , on this occasion . in such a position that it speedily warmed her enemies after a fashion as new as it was disagreeable . they uttered the most fearful shrieks , and the exhalations being dispelled by the power of the sun . all the marine family , with the fairy herself .
sir [male] 's harsh voice rang out in the silence , startling all . with the sound , sir [male] threw up his hands in a gesture of despair . he turned to the executioner , who stood beside a cauldron of fire . and pointed to the queen , horror held the great multitude in silence . and all eyes watched the man put his torch in the fire .
`` praise be to god , '' said the warrior that was higher up , `` amen ! '' said the man who was higher than he , and the rest of the warriors wished good luck to the king . he started then to climb down the tree with a heavy heart . but while he hung from the last branch and was about to let go , he noticed a tall warrior walking towards him . the king pulled himself up on the branch again and sat dangle legged on it to see what the warrior would do .
after three days search , they found the hut . the prince was still sitting by the door and had been so happy in the [male] 's company that the time had seemed like a single hour . before leaving he promised to return and fetch her to his father 's court . where he would make her his bride , when he had gone . she sat down to her wheel to make up for lost time .
now we must see what [male] was about , he was not thinking about [male] at all . least of all that she was just outside the palace , little [female] was blue with cold . nay , almost black ; but he did not know it . for the snow queen had kissed away the icy shiverings . and his heart was little better than a lump of ice .
learned authorities have frequently discussed , without agreeing , on the question of the origin of the corporations of the middle ages . it may be admitted , we think a priori . that associations of artisans were as ancient as the trades themselves . it may readily be imagined that the numerous members of the industrial classes . having to maintain and defend their common rights and common interests , would have sought to establish mutual fraternal associations among themselves .
thus the youth became the magician 's pupil . you wish to know how he taught him his art ? well , so be it , he stretched his hands and feet . turned him into a paper bag . and then left him to return to his proper shape as best he could .
all the little dwarfs waved their caps and their big brown hands . as [female] and [female] went back to the sunny upper earth . which they had not seen for seven years , they wandered for a long time . when finally they came to the hut where [female] had been born . but strange people lived in it now—his wicked black eyed family had all died .
she must have been a pretty creature enough at that time . and he knew that before her fall she was considered one of the most skilful rope dancers . an elderly woman with a boy , whose blindness helped her to arouse compassion . was crouching by [male] 's side , and had just been greeted by [male] as an old acquaintance . they had journeyed from land to land in [male] 's famous troupe .
`` humph , humph , '' said the occupants . and the coach creaked and groaned ; for it had come to a mournful end . `` the beautiful has departed , '' it sighed -- or at least it might have done so . we came back in autumn , the coach was there still . but the pigs were gone , they were playing the grand lords out in the woods .
he was just able to turn with his [male] the ring on his little finger . immediately he felt himself lighter and freer than he had ever felt before . and his heart seemed to harden to a steel spring . while a gay and reckless mood came over him . a wild desire to fly took possession of him at the same time .
then he heard a confused humming , and the leaden weight of his head held him backward as he sank in his chair . and consciousness quite forsook him , he had a confused recollection of having come there . or rather of having been carried along , as if on men 's shoulders , with a sort of rushing motion . but it was utterly indistinct ; the imperfect recollection simply of a sensation . he had seen or heard nothing on his way .
' what shall this serve me ? he asked of her , wondering . he put her from him and left her in the rank grass . and going to the edge of the mountain he placed the knife in his belt and began to climb down . and his soul besought him piteously , but he heeded it not . but leapt from crag to crag , being sure footed as a wild goat , and at last he reached the level ground and the yellow shore of the sea .
[female] and the mermaid princess settled themselves back comfortably in their seats and looked about them . the [organization] certainly had every convenience , of course almost everything was made of ice . but , then , so is most everything in a pullman car made of steel . there was really very little difference except that the ice was much prettier , it was so clear and white . and the moss cushions that covered the seats were soft and springy .
the grey goose goes out into the wide world . where she and a discontented sausage meet the cock and the fox . `` yes , that is so , '' said the grey goose ; for she always sang the same tune as the great red fox . as a good wife should , so off he packed , and by and by he came to neighbor cock 's house , rap , tap , tap ! he knocked at the door , and who should look out of the window but the cock himself .
and the bandmaster wrote a work of twenty five volumes about the artificial bird . it was so learned , long , and so full of the hardest chinese words that everyone said they had read it and understood it . for once they had been very stupid about a book , and had been trampled under foot in consequence . so a whole year passed , the emperor , the court . and all the chinese knew every note of the artificial bird 's song by heart .
after a time they seemed to be going down hill , far away gleamed a light which grew brighter and brighter every moment . at last [female] could see that they were close to the mouth of a large cave . in front of which sat a perfectly enormous black cat with green eyes shining like lights on a railway signal . its tail was standing straight up on end , black and bushy ; never had [male] seen such a tail before . the dragon went on past the cat into the cave .
it has been already mentioned that the devil , or his emissaries . in the shape of three ravens , waited to catch the soul of [male] as soon as it left the body . a freebooter of former days , who made a house underground for his wife in loch con . in lower rannoch , that he and his men might swear he had no wife above ground . and then married another , was at his death carried away by twelve ravens .
but the big [male] goat went on up the mountain . and you may believe that his two brothers were glad to see him again . and to hear that the great wicked [male] was gone from under the bridge , and after that they all stayed up on the mountain together . and the smaller goats ate so much grass and grew so fat and big that after a while no one could have told one [male] goat from the other . in the little village of plouvinec there once lived a poor stone cutter named [male] .
through every room in the house they went . but nowhere was she to be found , neither was one of the servants to be seen . but [female] , who had kept to the lower part of the house . which was now quiet enough , began to hear a confused sound as of a distant hubbub . and set out to find where it came from , the noise grew as his sharp ears guided him to a stair and so to the wine cellar .
`` so here you are at last , '' said a voice from somewhere , so suddenly that it made [male] jump . he looked round on every side . but for a long time could see nothing , at last , in the dim light . he could just make out what looked like the figure of an old , old woman with a very crooked back and a [female] , wrinkled face . she was sitting in a dark corner in a high backed chair .
as he went along he collected , with promises and flattery . all the idle boys who had taken a dislike to books and school . as soon as his coach was full he conducted them to the `` land of boobies , '' that they might pass their time in games . in uproar , and in amusement , when these poor , deluded boys .
there was once an honest journeyman tailor . by name [male] , who learned his trade with an excellent master in [location] . it could not be said that [male] was unhandy with the needle . on the contrary , he could make excellent work : moreover , one would have done him injustice to have called him lazy . nevertheless , his companions knew not what to make of him , for he would often sew for hours together so rapidly that the needle would glow in his hand .
yes , surely there she was ; and the ship was sailing up with [female] and [female] on board . the church and the lighthouse appeared to them as a heron and a swan rising from the blue waters . [female] sat on deck , and saw the sand hills gradually looming forth . if the wind held she might reach her home in about an hour . so near were they to home and its joys .
at first the king was so surprised and frightened that he could only stare ; but the fakeer beckoned to him to come down . so , mustering up his courage , he boldly stepped down into the grave . the fakeer rose , and , making a sign to the king to follow . walked a few paces along a dark passage , then he stopped . turned solemnly to his companion , and , with a movement of his hand .
still , they had raised the storm , and , as other people in a similar position have often discovered . knew not how to allay it , if they recommended [male] 's pardon . they feared that their father would begin to doubt whether he had really committed any offence at all . so they hung their heads and said nothing . whilst [male] turned upon them a grateful look for having saved him from two such unpleasant alternatives as those which had been suggested .
there great rejoicings were taking place , and the bear hunters . asking what it was all about , were told that it was because prince [male] . the torment of his subjects , had been struck dead by a [male] . just punishment of all his crimes , four courtiers . his wicked companions , had wished to divide his throne among them .
whereat [female] 's face turned as red as a schoolboy 's who is going to be whipped . and she stood lost in shame and confusion at seeing herself vanquished . but as there were to be two heats to the race , she fell to planning how to be revenged for this affront . and going home , she put a charm into a ring of such power that if any one had it upon his finger his legs would totter so that he would not be able to walk . much less run ; then she sent it as a present to lightning .
when the physician heard this cruel order . he readily judged that the honours and presents he had received from the king had procured him enemies . and that the weak prince was imposed upon , he repented that he had cured him of his leprosy . but it was now too late , is it thus , replies the physician . that you reward me for curing you ?
such was the sad plight of old [female] , who was bemoaning the loss of her property on the wrong side of the gorge so many years ago . when there appeared to her suddenly a cowled monk , whose dark face was scarcely discernible . with a rosary hanging to his girdle , and a deep but pleasant voice . enquiring the cause of her distress , the monk . in sympathetic tones , promised to aid her , he would , he said .
`` what is blacker than soot ? '' said the cobbler ; and taking the sack . he shook it out over the pieces of linen till not a thread of white was to be seen . after which he went home , and boasted of his good deeds . the widow now saw that she must be more careful as to what she said . so , after weighing the matter for some time , she suggested to the cobbler that the next night he should watch for ghosts at home .
`` oh , it is beautiful , '' said the emperor , `` it has my highest approval ! '' and he nodded his satisfaction as he gazed at the empty loom . nothing would induce him to say that he could not see anything . the whole suite gazed and gazed , but saw nothing more than all the others . however , they all exclaimed with his majesty , `` it is very beautiful ! ''
from childhood she had always been fond of flowers . stealing was prohibited by her father as wicked and dangerous , and she had never transgressed his commands . when she picked up the costly rosary in [location] . she had intended to return it to the owner . but to pluck the flowers and fruit which the lord caused to grow and ripen for every one was a different thing .
so they went on their way together , and came at last to a wood . where , being tired with walking , they paused to rest under the shade of a tree . where a spring of water sported with the tender grass . refreshing it with its crystal spray . they laid themselves down on the green carpet and soon fell fast asleep .
the wind that succeeded the calm was [person] and favourable . and did not change for fifty days , but brought [location] safe to the port of a fine city . well peopled , and of great trade , the capital of a powerful state . where we came to anchor , our vessel was speedily surrounded with an infinite number of boats full of people . who came to congratulate their friends upon their safe arrival , or to inquire for those they had left behind them in the country from whence they came .
thus the princess became a kitchen maid , and helped the cook to do all the dirtiest work . but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat that was left . and on this they lived , she had not been there long before she heard that the king 's eldest son was passing by . going to be married ; and she went to one of the windows and looked out . everything was ready , and all the pomp and brightness of the court was there .
the next day the same thing happened ; the princess watched the dinner . and as she watched she wept , then , while nobody was looking . she plucked another strand of golden hair and the prince found it as he had done the other . and no one could tell him whence it came . the third day the same thing happened as had happened twice before .
then the finland woman lifted little [female] on the reindeer and away he sped . `` oh , i have left my gloves and boots behind , '' cried [female] . she missed them in the piercing cold . but the reindeer did not dare to stop , on he ran till he came to the [male] with red berries . then he set [female] down and kissed her mouth .
cinderella listened in silence , turning her face to the kitchen fire . and perhaps it was that which made her look so rosy , but nobody ever noticed or admired her at home . so it did not signify , and next morning she went to her weary work again just as before . a few days after , the whole city was attracted by the sight of a herald going round with a little glass slipper in his hand . publishing , with a flourish of trumpets .
at first the courier took a tremendous bound , but [male] pursued him in his slipper carriage . overtook him , passed him , and had been standing for some time at the goal . when his opponent , gasping for breath , ran up , amazement for a few moments enchained the spectators . the king was the first to clap his hands ; then shouted the crowd for joy . all exclaiming , `` long live the little [male] , the victor in the race ! ''
[female] descended the small bank that separated the wood from the river and hesitatingly approached the shabby tents . as he did so a whole swarm of nut brown children came running towards him . from every corner , with outstretched , begging hands , their rags hanging in tatters around their thin little bodies . some were quite naked and as dark as mahogany , with enormous black eyes and feathery lashes . they screamed and chattered , and many of them turned mad somersaults over the stony ground to attract the wanderer 's attention .
amgrad , when he saw the door forced open . gave himself up as a lost man : he reflected whether it would be more advisable to go into the house . or to retreat as fast as he could , to avoid the danger which he believed inevitable . and was just going to have recourse to the latter , when the lady returned . seeing that he did not enter , why do not you come into your house , said she .
bread. -- the gauls , who principally inhabited deep and thick forests . fed on herbs and fruits , and particularly on acorns . it is even possible that the veneration in which they held the oak had no other origin . this primitive food continued in use , at least in times of famine . up to the eighth century , and we find in the regulations ofchrodegand that if .
as to whether there are really any fairies or not , that is a difficult question . professor [male] thinks there are none . the editor never saw any himself , but he knows several people who have seen them . in the highlands -- and heard their music , if ever you are in nether lochaber . go to the fairy hill , and you may hear the music yourself .
`` how ugly she is , how ugly she is , '' and he fancied they must refer to some dwarf the princess was bringing with her . it never occurred to him that they could apply to the bride herself . the princess [female] 's portrait was carried at the head of the procession . and after it walked the king surrounded by his courtiers . he was all impatience to see the lovely princess .
the mountain was clothed on this side with tall forest trees . the drooping firs offered an inviting shade . it was seven o'clock in the evening . the men were packing up their tools to go home . they would be obliged to march back through the tunnel ; for there was no way round .
although he was such a little boy , he had already traveled a considerable distance . his birthplace was in the canton of vallais . whence he had been brought over the mountains to where he now lived . he had even made his way on foot to the staubbach . which descends through the air gleaming like silver below the snow clad mountain called the jungfrau .
[female] took farewell of his betrothed bride and continued his journey . he was drawing near his own kingdom ; but his elder brothers had put guards everywhere . so as not to let him come near his father , the guards gave notice at once that [male] was coming . the elder brothers met him on the road . drugged him , took the flask of healing water .
the king and princess promised then that the proclamation would be carried out if he would free her from the horns . after these words he set about the cure . he took from his pocket an apple . and cut it into four parts ; he told her to lie down . and gave her the first fourth of the apple , she was not able however to lie with comfort by reason of the horns .
`` ah , [female] pollito , '' replied the wind , when i was caught in the branches of the chestnut tree you would not help me . now you are punished , and he swirled [male] pollito over the roofs of the houses till they reached the highest church in the town . and there he left him fastened to the top of the steeple . and there stands [male] pollito to this day .
she { 19 } was said to have been tenderly attached to a youth of remarkable beauty . named [female] , who , to her grief and indignation . proved faithless to her , he was about to unite himself to a nymph called [male] . when , in the midst of the wedding feast . the rage of the incensed goddess suddenly burst forth upon all present , a panic seized the assembled guests .
by this time the witch was just at their heels . but the princess stood in the window and blew upon the witch . hundreds of white doves flew out of her mouth . fluttered and flapped around the witch 's head until she grew so angry that she turned into flint . and there she stands to this day , in the shape of a large flint stone .
they pointed to the corner where [female] was hidden . and she came out , blushing so much , that the young king was dazzled with her beauty . in spite of her shabby gown , he rose . and made her a profound reverence , paying her besides so many elegant compliments . that the queen became very much displeased , king charming took no heed .
the every day married lady is the inventor of a thing which few foreign nations have as yet adopted either in their houses or languages . this thing is `` comfort , '' the word can not well be defined . the items that enter into its composition being so numerous , that a description would read like a catalogue . we all understand however what it means , although few of [location] are sensible of the source of the enjoyment . a widower has very little comfort , and a bachelor .
behind them came a great rabble of men on foot armed with all sorts of weapons . and last of all was the king with his attendants , very nervous and ill at ease . so the army started , far in advance , [male] continued his wild career . presently in his course he came to a great field of castor oil plants . ten or twelve feet high , big and bushy , but quite green and soft .
if i but turn to left or right it does the same with all its might . it looks so ugly and so black when o er my shoulder i look back . sometimes it runs ahead of me , sometimes quite short it seems to be . and then again it 's very tall ; i [person] t know what it is at all , i ll climb into my little bed .
then they stored her well with food and water . and pulled the [male] up on board , and settled themselves each man to his oar . and kept time to [male] harp ; and away across the bay they rowed southward . while the people lined the cliffs ; and the women wept . while the men shouted , at the starting of that gallant crew .
but out of the water he dared not put his head . for the rain came down by bucketsful , and the hail hammered like shot on the stream . and churned it into foam ; and soon the stream rose . and rushed down , higher and higher , and fouler and fouler , full of beetles , and sticks . and straws , and worms , and addle eggs , and wood lice .
filled with terror , he beat upon the stone . and called to the magician to let him out , but there was no answer . he put his shoulders under the stone and tried to lift it . but it would not stir , [male] sat down and wept bitter tears . he felt he was a prisoner forever .
the lad saw that they were his own wife and the wives of his brothers . he kept silent and did not stir , the maidens , putting on the human dresses which they had brought with them . went to embrace the roaring giant , who they supposed was asleep . but seeing him nailed to the ground with an arrow through his heart and dead . they were horror stricken , they ran back to the pond .
the next morning she again stole out to see him . he was alive but very weak , he could only open his eyes for a moment to look at tiny . who stood by holding a piece of decayed wood in her hand . for she had no other lantern , then she brought the swallow some water in a flower leaf . and after he had drunk , he told her that he had wounded one of his wings in a thorn bush .
so the day went on , her path grew wilder . the woods more difficult to go through , great masses of tangled vines interlaced and hung low . reaching out their tendrils as if to hinder her , clouds gathered . and the skies were dark , a storm seemed coming , the birds ceased twittering . low mutterings of thunder , far away , broke the stillness .
but the first ball was not the last , and [female] could not stand it . it was a good thing , therefore , that summer brought with it rest . and exercise in the open air , the family had been invited by the old count to visit him at him castle . that was a castle with a garden which was worth seeing , part of this garden was laid out quite in the style of the old days . with stiff green hedges ; you walked as if between green walls with peep holes in them .
the little boy said not a word ; he was half pleased and half afraid . they entered a long gallery , where the boy had been before . the walls were resplendent with paintings ; here stood statues and busts . all in a clear light as if it were day . but the grandest appeared when the door of a side room opened .
and when she came to an old grey tower . that seemed like an old man that death has forgotten , she resolved to throw herself down from it . and thus swiftly to find herself at her journey 's end . but as she stood on the top of the tower . her arms outstretched , like a white butterfly that poises its wings for flight .
but there after a while , [female] went about , and was so strange and dull and silent . then the princesses asked him what he lacked . and if he did not like to live with them any longer ? yes , he did . for they had enough and to spare , and he was well off in every way . but still somehow or other he did so long to go home , for his father and mother were alive .
oftentimes he called to her and prayed of her . but she would not ; and when he sought to seize her she dived into the water as a seal might dive . nor did he see her again that day , and each day the sound of her voice became sweeter to his ears . so sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his cunning . and had no care of his craft , vermilion finned and with eyes of bossy gold .
the borders of the panels had roses and holly and laurel and other foliage . and german mottoes in black letter of odd old-world moralising . such as the old teutons , and the dutch after them . love to have on their chimney places and their drinking cups . their dishes and flagons , the whole was burnished with gilding in many parts .
some time after this , an adventurous person attempted to draw off the water . in order to discover its contents , when a terrific form arose from the midst of the lake . commanding him to desist , or otherwise he would drown the country . these tylwyth teg are , as we see , regarded as fairies . but we think improperly ; for diminutive size is an attribute of the fairies in all parts of the british isles .
the captain was condemned to be hanged , and was executed forthwith , the lord of the thirty nine maidens received them all . to whose number the princess added one of her most beautiful handmaids . thus making up the forty , the prince and the princess . the betrothed of destiny , celebrated their wedding with great joy and pomp for forty days and forty nights . the prince , as the true heir , was crowned king .
a slave , being discontented with his lot , ran away from his master . he was soon missed by the latter , who lost no time in mounting his horse and setting out in pursuit of the fugitive . he presently came up with him , and the slave . in the hope of avoiding capture , slipped into a treadmill and hid himself there . `` aha , '' said his master , `` that 's the very place for you , my man ! ''
the night was drawing down now , and we had to look for a house that would give [location] shelter . we saw a hut far off the road and we went to the broken door . it was the house of the hags of the long teeth . we asked for shelter , they showed [location] a big bed in the dormer room . and they told [location] we could have supper when the porridge was boiled .
the kind hearted young man picked out a lump of meat . went to the door , and threw it outside to him . the dog pounced upon it , and gulped it down greedily . and was just turning to go , when it staggered , fell , rolled over , and died . [male] mahomed , who had been lazily watching him , stood still for a moment .
by this artifice , the cunning magician led [male] some way into the country . and as he meant to carry him farther , pretending to be tired , he took an opportunity to sit down in one of the gardens on the brink of a fountain of clear water . which discharged itself by a lion 's mouth of bronze into a basin . come , nephew , said he , you must be weary as well as i . let [location] rest ourselves , and we shall be better able to pursue our walk .
the sultans , upon this , inquired of the father of the princes if he had any other sons . to which he replied that he had one ; but that he had long rejected him . and also his mother , from notice ; and that they lived among the domestics of the palace . the sultans entreated to see him , and he was introduced . but in a mean habit , the two princesses whom he had delivered from the monsters and married immediately recognized him .
by the laws of the kingdom , to kill or injure a mole was made a capital offence . and once every year a little blind gentleman in a fine black velvet coat arrived at the palace to pay his respects to their majesties . who received him with every mark of favor and affection . once there lived a poor girl whose wicked aunt treated her very cruelly , one morning . the aunt set out for a day of shopping and visiting to the neighboring town .
the sweet music was now close at hand under the little window . and a moment after a troop of the little people appeared on the window sill . playing on pipes , flutes , and other instruments made of green reeds from the brook and of shells from the shore . the fairy band stepped down most gracefully from the window sill . and was closely followed by a long train of little men and women magnificently dressed .
now it was plain that the lady must be a real princess . since she had been able to feel the three little peas through the twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds . none but a real princess could have had such a delicate sense of feeling . the prince accordingly made her his wife . being now convinced that he had found a real princess , the three peas were however put into the cabinet of curiosities .
as soon as they reached the vessel , and could talk together freely , the boys had an animated discussion . it was unanimously agreed that they would make an attempt to get some of the precious fruit from the fragile palm . and the only difference of opinion among them was as to how it should be done . most of them were in favor of some method of climbing the tree and trusting to its not breaking . but this the oldest boy would not listen to ; the trunk might snap , and then somebody would be hurt .
conspicuous among this awful band appeared the figures of the three crones . bony , skinny , and humpy . each carrying a broomstick in her hand , and followed by her cat . which bounded forward as if to attack the invaders of the haunted hill , this was more than the latter could stand . they wavered -- looked round -- tottered a step or two backward .
while she was thinking thus , her sister ran to embrace her . looking so happy and plump that [female] could not help weeping as she gazed at her . rose had married a young farmer , who loved her dearly ; and together they managed the farm that was the fairy 's marriage portion . rose had not many servants , but those she had she treated so kindly that they were as devoted to her as if they were her children . her neighbours , too , were so fond of her that they were always trying to show it .
the news of the success of the priest king opened a door of hope to the desponding [female] world , [female] . determined at once to effect a union with this mysterious personage . and on the 27th of [male] , 1177 , wrote him a letter . which he intrusted to his physician , [male] , to deliver in person . [male] started on his embassy , but never returned , the conquests of tschengis khan again attracted the eyes of [male] [location] to the east .
he was now more frightened than ever , and in order to amend his error he plucked off the feathers . rolled himself about in the floury mess . then amongst the feathers , and then sat on the nest as if he were sitting . his wife came home , and , as she found the cellar door wide open . she went down stairs , and found her husband sitting in the nest and hissing like a goose .
when they arrived at the palace , the [female] ordered [female] to be laid on a sofa . in the fourth hall , from whence he had been carried home fast asleep a month before . but first he bade the attendants to put him on the same habit in which he had acted the [male] . which was done , he then charged all the eunuchs , officers , ladies . and musicians who were in the hall , when he drank the last glass of wine which had put him to sleep .
there was a rush to the window , the blind was drawn up . and soon , in the darkness of the night , a grand catharine wheel was seen whizzing round in a blaze of dripping fire . then such a glorious shoot of rockets arose , whish , bang ! whish , bang ! they went as they burst , each of them . into a shower of gorgeous stars all purple .
long , long ago in the days when there were no schools , there lived a man and his wife and their only child . he was a bright , clever boy , and his parents were very ambitious for their dear boy . and wished him to become a great and renowned man , they saw that the children who could not read or write . but who just played all day long , had to go to work while still very young . and were generally so stupid that they could never earn much money ; so they determined to let their boy have an education .
so king [male] dwelt in the palace . with his new friend [male] , and found a great deal of comfort in his magnificent abode . but would doubtless have found as much , if not more , in the humblest cottage by the wayside . before many years went by , there was a group of rosy little children ( but how they came thither has always been a mystery to me ) . sporting in the great hall , and on the marble steps of the palace .
and the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased , and then he carried the tin soldier into the house . afterwards he was sent over to ask the little boy if he would not like to pay a visit himself . his parents gave him permission . and so it was that he gained admission to the old house . the brassy knobs on the railings shone more brightly than ever .
the new laboratory was presently the scene of the most zealous labours . and [male] was delighted with his new position , for no apothecary and chemist had ever before had such a well fitted furnace and such delicate scales and instruments to work with . and if he did not understand what was the end of so much weighing and fusing and distilling . or what the remedies were that the doctor was always decanting from the boiling liquids . yet the occupation made the long summer days pass most pleasantly .
the party broke up before night had closed in ; not , as usual , dispersed by the eager impatience of the bridegroom to be alone with his bride . but dropping off listlessly , as a general gloom spread over the assembly . [female] was followed to her dressing room by her women only . and the knight by his pages , at this gloomy feast . there was no question of the gay and sportive train of bridesmaids and young men .
one day we were sitting by the entrance of a cavern . much visited by strangers , who ascended the mountain : the rushing noise of a subterranean torrent resounded from the fathomless abyss . the depths of which exceeded all calculation , he was . according to his favourite custom , employing all the powers of his lavish fancy . and all the charm of the most brilliant colouring , to depict to me what i might effect in the world by virtue of my purse .
on the other hand , the sultan , having a store of darts ready to his hand in the chariot . cast them at the prince , and with one of them pierced the prince 's cuirass . and made a grievous wound in his side , so did the combat rage between these two . the prince being at this disadvantage also , that his horse could not endure the look of the sultan 's horses . so fierce and fiery of aspect were they .
it was a fine day , the sky was clear and the wind was in the right airt . being from the north , but , as they say , if custom will not get custom . custom will weep , a basinful of water was brought from the holy well and given to the wise woman that sold fair winds . as she stood on the harbour side with the women and children to watch the boats off . they told her to look and tell of the luck of the herring [female] .
when the queen saw that her magic had failed her she grew as pale as death . and fell to [female] in every limb , she turned and hastened quickly away . and the prince followed her wondering . for he neither knew the mischief she had intended doing him . nor how his ring had saved him from the fate of those others .
on the door 's being opened , there came in a little old man , about two feet and a half high . with a red sugar loaf hat and a long scarlet coat . reaching down nearly to the ground , his hair was long and grey . and his face yellow and wrinkled , he went over to the fire ( which the family had quitted in their fear ) . sat down and dried his clothes , and began smoking a pipe which he found there .
[male] , however , found a remedy for this -- he simply lifted the whole roof off the barn . and set it down in the field beside . he then emptied down all the corn that he could lay his hands on and threshed away . he went through one lot after another , and it was ll the same to him what he got hold of . so before midday he had threshed all the squire 's grain .
the wife agreed , lighted a candle , and they hid themselves in the corner of the room behind the clothes which were hanging there . at midnight came two little naked men , who sat down at the shoemaker 's table . took up the cut-out work , and began with their tiny fingers to stitch . sew , and hammer so neatly and quickly , that the shoemaker could not believe his eyes . they did not stop till everything was quite finished .
neither the wild geese nor [female] fox had believed that they should ever run across each other after they had left skåne . but now it turned out so that the wild geese happened to take the route over blekinge and thither [male] fox had also gone . so far he had kept himself in the northern parts of the province . and since he had not as yet seen any manor parks , or hunting grounds filled with game and dainty young deer . he was more disgruntled than he could say , one afternoon .
then she took both their hands , and promised that if ever she should pass through the town . she would call and pay them a visit . and then she rode away into the wide world , but [female] and [female] went hand-in-hand towards home . and as they advanced , spring appeared more lovely with its green verdure and its beautiful flowers . very soon they recognized the large town where they lived .
ceres scarcely waited to hear what the nymphs had to say before she hurried off to make inquiries all through the neighbourhood . but nobody told her anything that could enable the poor mother to guess what had become of [female] . a fisherman , it is true , had noticed her little footprints in the sand . as he went homeward along the beach with a basket of fish . a rustic had seen the child stooping to gather flowers .
dietel would far rather have served the cologne theologians . whom he regarded as the appointed defenders of the true faith . than the insignificant folk at the other tables who had just finished their meal . how unmannerly their behaviour was , better wine had been served before dessert . and they now shouted and sang so loudly and so out of tune that the air played by the strolling musicians could scarcely be distinguished .
but , as from the very beginning they had all made up their minds that to this end they must come . they met their death nobly ; and their corpses were carried to sengakuji . and buried in front of the tomb of their master . [male] no [location] , and when the fame of this became noised abroad . the people flocked to pray at the graves of these faithful men .
hardly knowing what he did , he stooped over her and kissed her . as their eyes again met , a deep , radiant contentment shone from her countenance . it was not a mere momentary brightening of the features . such as he had often noticed in her before , but something inexpressibly tender . soul felt , and absolute , it was as if that kiss had suddenly transformed the child into a woman .
but now that the carriage was ready to carry the young prince to his own country . the faithful [male] helped in the bride and bridegroom . and placed himself in the seat behind , full of joy at his master 's release . they had not proceeded far when the prince heard a crack as if something had broken behind the carriage . so he put his head out of the window and asked [male] what was broken .
it was now , what with the snow and what with natural evening . growing quickly dark , the birds had ceased to sing . only the munza night jar rattled , now near , now far away , the mulla mulgars heard the beasts of the forest beginning to range and roar in the gloom . nod buttoned up his sheep 's jacket . for there was a frost mist beneath the trees , he was cold .
the merchant made up his mind to ask if he might spend the night there . but to his surprise , when he reached the door he found it set wide open . and nobody about , after awhile , finding that no one came in answer to his repeated knocking . he walked inside , there he found a table laid with every delicacy . and , being very hungry , he sat down and made a good repast , after he had finished his supper he laid himself down on a luxurious couch .
at last , when they had eaten and conversed for some time about one thing and another . [male] took his leave ; and the cat stayed with the king . describing the worth , the wisdom , and the judgment of [male] . and , above all , the great wealth he had in the plains of rome and [male] . which well entitled him to marry even into the family of a crowned king .
then the dwarf who had acted as guide to the countess before conducted her back through the castle garden . and soon she rested , tired , but with a peaceful and happy heart , once more on her couch . a sunny terrace of the castle hill became the last resting place of the countess [female] . it had been her favourite spot both in her days of health and of sickness . here she had spent part of every day with her [male] .
of course [female] and her mother could not hear their words . but from [female] 's angry face as she left the room . it was not difficult to guess what had happened , but the mirror had more to tell . for it appeared that in fury at her rejection by the king . [male] had ordered four strong men to scourge him till he fainted .
as she was about to leave the hamlet , a young shepherdess advanced towards the queen . and presented her with a little white greyhound on a cushion of white velvet . embroidered with silver and pearls : it was hardly possible to distinguish the dog from the cushion . the colour was so exactly the same , the fairy [female] . sovereign of the happy empire , said the young shepherdess to the queen .
and at last [male] came up with him , where he lay panting on a slab among the snow . and caught him by the horns , and forced his head back . and drove the keen sword through his throat , then he turned . and went back limping and weary , feeling his way down by the clue of thread . till he came to the mouth of that doleful place and saw waiting for him .
then the prophetess knew that it was none other than the greatest of the gods who had called her up . and [female] rode sadly homeward knowing that already [female] was making itself beautiful against the coming of [female] . the other gods meanwhile had become merry again ; for had not everything promised to protect their beloved [male] ? they even made sport of that which troubled them . for when they found that nothing could hurt [male] .
one morning she made up her mind to surprise him into speaking . and as he sat beside the hearth , peering at her through his half closed eyes . she set an egg shell on the fire . and placing in this a spoonful of broth , stirred it carefully with a silver pin . the poupican was amazed , for it was nearing the dinner hour .
the young smith had fashioned a wonderful flying bird of iron ! its wings , which it flapped like a real bird . were of iron tempered a lovely jewel blue , its breast was of iron forged to a silver gray . and its beak and claws and living round eyes were of iron as red as fire . within it a spring of iron lay .
after him all the court came with questions . so when the page advanced to gather up the money the load was almost more than he could carry . then [male] jumped down from his perch , and another page lifted him safely on to the big warm back of lord [male] 's horse . which felt fine and comforting to poor [male] 's feet , he was so tired that he took forty winks after he had told the princess how to reach the cottage of mother [male] . when he woke they were all in the dim forest and the princess [female] and lord [female] were talking in low tones like the whisper of the wind through flowers .
the arena was then cleared amidst much applause , and the dead hobbyhorses dragged solemnly away by two moorish pages in yellow and black liveries . and after a short interlude , during which a french posture master performed upon the tightrope . some italian puppets appeared in the semi classical tragedy of sophonisba on the stage of a small theatre that had been built up for the purpose . they acted so well , and their gestures were so extremely natural , that at the close of the play the eyes of the infanta were quite dim with tears . indeed some of the children really cried , and had to be comforted with sweetmeats .
he lived in a cave in the midst of the mount . and whenever he wanted food he would wade over to the main land . where he would furnish himself with whatever came in his way . everybody at his approach ran out of their houses . while he seized on their cattle , making nothing of carrying half a dozen oxen on his back at a time .
the highest development which the type had so far reached was the huge ape like creature which had existed on the three physical planets . [male] , the earth and [male] in the third round . on the arrival of the human life wave on the earth in this the fourth round . a certain number , naturally , of these ape like creatures were found in occupation . the residuum left on the planet during its period of obscuration .
he thanked her , and said he would gladly . as he was hungry and tired , he sat down with the children . who had by this time arranged themselves in a row . each one with an empty bowl in his hands , the broth tasted very good . and [male] , [male] , felt so much better after eating it that he proposed a game of tag .
the princess climbed up one of the silver chains . holding in her hand the little porter who , in spite of his minute size . opened a secret door with his golden key and let her in , she entered a magnificent room which appeared to occupy the entire castle . and which was lighted by gold and jewelled stars in the ceiling . in the midst of this room stood a couch .
hark , how the cricket joins the music with its chirp . chirp , chirp ; and how the kettle hums ! but what is this , even as i listen to them , blithely , and turn towards dot . for one last glimpse of a little figure very pleasant to me . she and the rest have vanished into air .
and then she confessed all her sin , and the executioner struck off her feet with the red shoes . but the shoes danced away with the little feet across the field into the deep forest . and he carved her a pair of wooden feet and some crutches . and taught her a psalm which is always sung by sinners . she kissed the hand that guided the axe .
surrounded as this word is with the odium which credulity on the one hand and imposture on the other have during many centuries of superstition and ignorance gradually caused it to be associated . let [location] consider for a moment its real meaning . and the terrible effects which its practice is ever destined to bring on the world . partly through their psychic faculties , which were not yet quenched in the depths of materiality to which the race afterwards descended . and partly through their scientific attainments during this culmination of atlantean civilization .
the noiseless movement and the rapid action of the serpent . combined with its fascinating gaze and magnetic power . no doubt lead savages to view it as a possessor of wisdom and embodiment of spirits . the [organization] and other indians of [location] perform masked dances in honour of their dead . they have a butterfly dance in which two performers represent large blue butterflies fluttering in the [male] .
in truth the king and all the knights of the round table were ready to expire with laughter at [male] on his fine curveting steed . but one day , as the hunt was passing a farm house . a big cat , lurking about , made one spring and carried both [male] and the mouse up a tree . nothing daunted , [male] boldly drew his needle sword and attacked the enemy with such fierceness that she let her prey fall . luckily one of the nobles caught the little fellow in his cap .
the study of [person] 's tales which we have made serves to illustrate the problems and difficulties of the subject in general . it has been seen that similar and analogous contes are found among most peoples . ancient and modern , when the resemblances are only in detached ideas and incidents . for example , the introduction of rational and loquacious beasts . or of magical powers , the difficulty of accounting for the diffusion of such notions is comparatively slight .
the next morning the princess of [location] ordered [female] to be conducted early to the bath . and then to be appareled in the robes of an emir or governor of a province . she commanded him to be introduced into the council . where his fine person and majestic air drew upon him the eyes of all the lords present . from the council board the prince was conducted to a palace .
all the morning [male] puzzled his brain examining books and papers . with little result , then he saddled his horse . rode into the nearest town , and sought a lawyer whom his father knew . to him he related their grievances . telling him that he was sure their property .
she continued her walk along by the margin of the sea . what was it she saw lying there ? an old hat . a man 's hat , now when might that have been washed overboard ? she drew nearer . she stopped to look at the hat ; ha ! what was lying yonder ? ', she shuddered . yet it was nothing save a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung across a long stone .
mrs. [female] then led her into her bedroom . where water lily threw off the outer garments in which she had appeared to the public as a beggar . and telling her wonderful story to chin 's mother , she revealed herself as her daughter in law . at last this plan was discussed , and it was decided that the unused buildings . in which chin and the buddhist priest had been accustomed to spend a part of every day together .
of course , all the morning as well as the evening papers . recounted , with flaming headings , [male] 's oration . and his ignominious expulsion from the mass meeting , and the most unsparing ridicule was showered both upon him and the journal which . for the time , he represented , one more [male] of a similar nature terminated his career as a journalist . i dared no longer espouse his cause and he was dismissed in disgrace .
where has the child been ? why did he run away and leave us ? where did he get this pretty , wonderful toy ? is he hurt , or hungry ? does he remember it is his birthday ? there will be presents for him at the burgh . and a cake for tea , did [male] bring him home ?
`` if we had anything to sit upon , '' said [female] , `` they could carry [location] over the pass . '' she had no sooner spoken than the largest of the bats bit off one of his own long wings . and laid it at [male] 's feet . it did not seem to matter much to him that he had parted with it .
hereupon [male] burst into tears . he wept so much that the splinter rolled out of his eye . and he recognised her , and shouted , [female] . sweet little [female] , where have you been so long ? and where have i been ? he looked round him .
see [location] looking , now , at you ? two little cheeks so plump and round . where the red rose of health is found , two little ears where sound comes in . one little nose and mouth and chin , rows of little teeth all in white . ready for use when lunch is in sight . one little tongue kind words to say .
in drawing back his hand , the prince chanced to let it fall on that of the princess of [location] . and on opening his eyes , was exceedingly surprised to perceive a lady of the greatest beauty . he raised his head and leaned on his elbow . the better to consider her , she was so beautiful that he could not help crying out . `` what beauty , my heart , my soul ! ''
mistletoe 's tears flowed afresh ; but you see she had said all that miss [female] was so curious to know about . and the fatal secret was out , the quarter bell rang for dinner . and both the women hastened to their rooms to make ready ; [female] still boo hooing and snuffling . and declaring that she had always said some wretched , abominable villain would tell her child about that horrid . ridiculous legend , that was a perfect falsehood , as anybody could see .
by this time he had not a penny left . so he went back to his two brothers and told his tale . and the second brother said to himself as he listened . certainly he has managed very badly , but i should like to see if i can not do better . and win the princess for my own self , so he called together all the shipbuilders throughout the country .
so [male] told him the sad story of his swelled cheek . and how he had been advised to come to the forest and beg the dwarfs to cure him . with that , he and all the other dwarfs sat down in a large ring . leaving [male] to dance alone in the middle , he felt half frightened to death . and besides was a good deal shaken by his fall from the tree and did not feel at all inclined to dance .
[female] could hardly stand against the stream , and hid behind a rock . but the trout did not ; for out they rushed from among the stones . and began gobbling the beetles and leeches in the most greedy and quarrelsome way . and swimming about with great worms hanging out of their mouths , tugging and kicking to get them away from each other . and now , by the flashes of the lightning , [male] saw a new sight .
but [male] had found out the day he was coming . and told his sister she must put on the big boiling pot with a little water in it . just as the king came in , [male] dragged the pot off the fire and ran off with it to the chopping block . and so boiled the porridge on the block , the king wondered at that . and wondered on and on , so much that he quite forgot what brought him there .
said the prince to himself , and accordingly striking into it . proceeded onwards for twenty days , at the end of which he encamped near a desolated city . crumbling into ruin , wholly destitute of inhabitants . he commanded his attendants , as no provisions could be found in the city . to kill five sheep of the flocks he had brought with him .
the storks tell their little ones very many stories . all of the moor and the marsh , these stories are generally adapted to the age and capacity of the hearers . the youngest are content if they are told [male] , plurre murre as a story , and find it charming ; but the older ones want something with a deeper meaning . or at any rate something relating to the family .
no horse but gran could ride that flame . no man alive but [male] sit him while he leaped through it . inside the house lay a fair [female] , armed from head to foot . in a deep sleep , [female] , [female] 's sister . was her name , a valkyrie , a corse chooser .
to one only of the gods did she give her loyal allegiance . she worshipped [female] , and with her followed the chase . as she lightly sped through the forest she might have been [female] herself . and there were those who said they would not know nymph from goddess , but that the goddess carried a silver bow . while that of [female] was made of horn , fearless , and without a care or sorrow .
first came the [location] 's eldest son , the ocean king . to greet them , the sea was a mass of fire with gleaming phosphorus . and king ocean and his mermaid daughters seemed to be floating in red flames as they approached , the maidens long and wonderfully beautiful hair floated behind them as they swam . and they sang the most entrancing songs , they bore an invitation to prince [male] and his bride to visit them in their marine home .
but he had been so stern about it -- and his beard got very blue when he was angry . that [female] put her curiosity away , and continued to entertain her guests . still , the temptation to slip away and open that forbidden door returned again and again . but always she said to herself , nay ; i have the run of the whole house beside . is it a great matter that i am forbidden one pokey little room at the end of a dark corridor ?
dolores ate her dinner when she became hungry . gave some of it to the squirrel , and played on until the shadows in the attic indicated that evening was coming . then she scrambled down and ran for home , she had time to brush the dust from her clothes . wash her face and hands , and lie down on the bed and fall asleep before aunt [female] returned . by the time supper was ready and dolores awakened .
but when the cook heard this , she got very angry . `` what is it you say , '' she cried . and gave the smith a smack with the ladle . `` if you will come along , then hang on , '' said [female] . and so she stuck fast to the others too , and for all her scolding and all her tearing and pulling .
these words delighted the good baron , and he gave a rich and magnificent feast in honor of his son 's return . the high [male] of [male] , after passing several pleasant days at [male] 's home . now decided that they had seen enough of the world and would be glad to return to their own kingdom . where all was peaceful and uneventful , and rule it to the end of their days . so the baron furnished them an escort of twenty men at arms .
gothic days were rough and strenuous , and the furniture was strong and heavy and was made chiefly of oak with no varnish of any kind . the characteristic lines of the furniture and the designs for carving were architectural . and a careful study of the gothic cathedrals of [female] . [location] , and england will give a very satisfactory idea of this wonderful time . the idea of the pointed arch , rose window .
[male] the hen wife 's son followed him . when he came to the sea shore he stood for a while looking out to sea with his knees knocking together . then he went where he had gone the day before . he climbed into a cave in the face of the cliff and he drew the [male] to the entrance of it so that it was quite hidden .

so she went into the garden and waved her stick over all the rose bushes and blossoms and all . they sank down into the black earth , and no one could see where they had been . the old woman was afraid that if [female] saw the roses she would begin to think about her own . and then would remember [female] and run away , then she led [female] out into the garden . how glorious it was , and what lovely scents filled the air !
[female] relates that [female] and a younger sister . [female] , were artists , a picture of the holy family . inscribed with [female] 's name , was formerly in the possession of a vicar of the church of [female] . it was of far less merit than the works of her sisters . [female] was the second daughter , the actual date of her birth is unknown .
as they were sitting in the lodge , surrounded by the friends and relatives . the mother of the red head regarded the face of her new daughter in law for a long time with fixed attention . from this scrutiny she was convinced that this singular and hasty marriage boded no good to her son . she drew him aside , and disclosed to him her suspicions . this can be no female , said she ; she has the figure and manners .
with these words [male] climbed up and sat upon the box with [male] merridew . a moment later the stage was on its course along the main road . pleasant words these for [male] to listen to , but [male] knew [male] and he had presence of mind enough to couch his expostulatory reply in the most obsequious terms . he protested against [male] 's harsh imputations . i ve had my say , was [male] 's answer .
yet she never complained , but meekly and faithfully performed her duties . doing the housework , carrying the water and helping her husband hoe the scanty crop that grew upon the best part of their land . one day , as she walked down the path to the brook . her big shoes scattering the pebbles right and left , she noticed a large beetle lying upon its back and struggling hard with its little legs to turn over . that its feet might again touch the ground , but this it could not accomplish .
the worshippers of set broke in upon this people . stopped this worship , or killed [male] , as was said , and established the dominion { 41 } of their animal god . they were in turn attacked by the [male] worshippers . who joined the older population of the [male] tribe . re opened the shrines , and established [male] worship again .
the peasant bowed to the ground , and returned home with a bottle full of the water of life . he hastened to the grave in the forest . lifted up the body of his daughter , and as soon as he had sprinkled it with the water the girl came to life again . and threw herself into his arms , all who were present were moved to tears . then the peasant started again for the capital , and arriving there went at once to the czar 's palace .
so she hurriedly put away her breakfast dishes . tidied up her room , locked the door , hid the key . and started on her way to school , she crossed the field and came to the old house by a path through a grove of old trees . this side of the house was never used ; the shutters were closed . and the trees grew so close to the house that their great branches scraped against the walls .
the second soldier 's turn to watch soon came , and the first laid him down to sleep . but the second man had not sat by himself long before up came the dwarf in the red jacket again . the soldier treated him in as friendly a way as his comrade had done . and the little man gave him a purse . which he told him would be always full of gold .
`` let the fireworks begin , '' said the king ; and the royal pyrotechnist made a low bow . and marched down to the end of the garden , he had six attendants with him . each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole , whizz , whizz ! went the [female] wheel , as she spun round and round , boom , boom ! went the roman candle , then the squibs danced all over the place .
so the king sent for all the goldsmiths in the kingdom . and they worked day and night till all the gold was made into most wonderful and beautiful forms of the finest workmanship . then they took them all aboard a great ship and set sail . they sailed for many days , till they came to the city where dwelt the daughter of the king of the golden palace . the faithful [male] had decided that it was better for him to go ashore .
`` when he is nice and plump , i shall eat him , '' said the cruel old witch , [male] wept bitterly . but it was quite in vain , for she was obliged to do the witch 's bidding . and every day she cooked the choicest food for her brother . while she herself lived upon nothing but oyster shells .
then the third soldier 's turn to watch came ; and he also had little red jacket for his guest . who gave him a wonderful horn , that drew crowds around it whenever it was played . and made every one forget his business to come and dance to its beautiful music . all this was very well for a time , but they found it would not do to stay at home always . so they got together all their rich clothes , and jewels .
the third fairy comforted the poor traveller , begged her not to lose heart . and assured her that her troubles should be rewarded , after a time her road led through a wood . full of soft airs and sweet odours , and before she had gone a hundred yards she saw a wonderful silver castle suspended by strong silver chains to four of the largest trees . it was so perfectly hung that a [female] breeze rocked it sufficiently to send you pleasantly to sleep . fairer than a fairy felt a strong desire to enter this castle , but besides being hung a little above the ground there seemed to be neither doors nor windows .
in 1895 she completed a life size statue of queen [female] for the [female] hospital , montreal . the queen is represented in royal robes . with one child asleep on her knee . while another , with its arm in a sling , stands on the steps of the throne . shortly before the queen 's death she gave sittings to countess [female] .
the king , who was an old ant , was very wise and courageous , as he was a real king . he wore a golden crown upon his head and held a golden scepter in his hand . his crown was a small piece of round gold wire . which fitted his head splendidly , his soldiers in one of their raids had found it in a country [male] 's casket . they took possession of it .
once upon a time there lived at quesnoy , in flanders . a great lord whose name was [female] . but whom the country people called [male] the wolf . now [male] had such a wicked , cruel heart , that it was whispered how he used to harness his peasants to the plough . and force them by blows from his whip to till his land with naked feet .
and the little boy looked at the teapot ; the lid rose up gradually . the elder tree blossoms sprang forth one by one , fresh and white ; long boughs came forth . even out of the spout they grew up in all directions . and formed a bush -- nay , a large elder tree . which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtains aside .
we follow [male] to the cheshire cheese . the public house where he delivers impassioned orations . and we follow sir [male] in his reluctant efforts to canvass the electorate . sir [male] and his running mate . the incumbent conservative candidate , win the election , but there is a petition .
as she was considering what to do , her two sisters appeared by her side . and said spitefully , well , you good for nothing , you have never done anything but try to make our father love you most and to spoil our chances in every way . prepare yourself for your end , for you have eaten your last piece of bread . kindness lifted up her hands , and besought them not to harm her . but they cut off her hands , and only spared her life under the condition that she would never go near her home again .
one day he was called from the court to an abbey . where three nuns brought to him a beautiful boy of fifteen . asking that he might be made a knight , this was sir [male] 's own son . [male] , whom he had never seen , and did not yet know , that evening sir [male] remained at the abbey with the boy . that he might keep his vigil there , and on the morrow 's dawn he was made a knight .
the daughter of the sultan did not refrain from comforting the [female] princess . at the same time representing the hopeless condition of her father . till at length she consented to the marriage . this joyful intelligence speedily revived the love lorn sultan , and the nuptials were celebrated with the utmost joy and magnificence . the aged sultan and sultana continued to lament the loss of their daughters for some years .
the young king of persia had no sooner got out of the city . than he began to reflect with joy on his deliverance . and that he had the sorceress in his power . who had given him so much cause to tremble , three days after he arrived at a great city . where , entering the suburbs , he met a venerable old man .
during that time she must amuse herself as best she could . she might go all over the house and examine the treasures that were in it . and he gave her a great bunch of keys which were the keys of the different rooms . one door alone she must not open , and that was the red door at the end of the passage . if she opened this , even so much as a crack , great misfortune would follow .
she scoured the dishes , tables , and [organization] chamber . and those of misses , her daughters ; she lay up in a sorry garret . upon a wretched straw bed , while her sisters lay in fine rooms . with floors all inlaid , upon beds of the very newest fashion . and where they had looking glasses so large , that they might see themselves at their full length .
said the master 's loving voice -- for it was he . and he laid his hand upon him . and instantly the deformed shell in which [male] was clothed fell from him . and he was more beautiful than ever , from that time forth there was no unhappiness for either [male] or [male] . because they had learnt that the light of [male] was the only true light .
it was a day of great joy . a day of song and revelry . throughout the whole kingdom the choice wine flowed and the sweet music resounded . in the palace the happy pair pledged themselves in a wedding cup . while the music played and glad songs were sung , later on , the great hall of the palace was cleared for a grand ball .
well , to commence , there was in the world a king , who was called the `` green king , '' and who had three daughters , he did not like them at all . he would have very much preferred if they had been boys , he continually scolded and abused them . and one day , in a fit of passion . the words slipped from his lips : what is the good of all these wenches ?
no , said the madcap i have killed it . if you do not believe me , come and see , but she did not want to go back into the jungle and said no more about it . as his wife had broken her silence the madcap saw no use in going further and they turned homewards . all the way his wife went on chatting and singing along with him . when he reached home he sacrificed a number of goats to his grandfather .
then all the kings sons were uneasy , and anxious to know who was she that lost the shoe . and they began to travel all over erin to know could they find her . the prince of emania and all the others went in a great company together . and made the round of erin ; they went everywhere . north , south , east , and west .
then [female] rose up sighing , and took his harp . and went over strymon , and he led [male] to the south west . up the banks of haliacmon and over the spurs of pindus . to dodona the town of [male] , where it stood by the side of the sacred lake . and the fountain which breathed out fire , in the darkness of the ancient oakwood .
already the rock bound shore loomed afar , and upon the shore [female] 's little cottage and the bar of white sand before it . as soon as the land hove in sight . the pursuit slackened , the foam fairies fear the shore . the mermaids keep away from the coast , wind and waves stayed on the high seas . and only the boat flew straight ahead to land like a child to its mother 's lap .
the young rajah gave his own two followers one hundred rupees a day . and , after putting aside one hundred for his own requirements , distributed the rest in charity . one day the king went to take a bath in the tank . or pond , and while bathing , his ring slipped off and fell into the water . he therefore called the young rajah and said to him .
the sea breeze blew freshly as [male] freed his kite from the [male] . and when he looked back there was land 's end just as he had seen it before . `` and fairyland 's end , too , '' he muttered . for all trace of the iron door had disappeared after he passed through . he stared in astonishment , and could not make it out .
there he took up a handful of earth . and pronounced , or rather muttered , some words which i did not understand , and threw it upon me . `` quit the shape of a man , '' said he to me . `` and take on you that of an ape , '' he vanished immediately . and left me alone , transformed into an ape , overwhelmed with sorrow in a strange country .
during the reign of one of the early stuart kings—which . is of little moment—roderick [male] ruled with a high and lordly hand within the feudal stronghold of [location] . he was a stout and stern knight . whose life had been spent amidst the turmoil of national warfare and clan strife . many a battle had he fought , and many a wound received since first he buckled on his father 's sword for deadly combat .
`` tomorrow , '' said the king , when he was told that the prisoners had arrived . `` the seven days '' [male] expires which i granted to those miscreants who insulted me . they shall go to execution with the stealers of my dinner . when the king of the peacocks entered the court of justice the old man flung himself on his knees . and declared that he would narrate all that had happened , as he told his story the king eyed the beautiful princess .
when the [female] got up in the morning , the sorry colt was not to be seen ! off she set in pursuit , at full speed did she fly in her iron mortar . urging it on with the pestle , sweeping away her traces with the broom . she dashed up to the fiery river . gave a glance , and said , `` a capital bridge ! ''
so the prince said good-bye to the friendly [male] and thanked it again . he mounted upon the horse 's back and away they went like the wind . soon they were out of the forest , and the dark was left behind them . on they went and on they went , until they came within sight of a smoking mountain . there the horse stopped , so all the rest of that day the horse and the prince lay hidden .
but whether built of metal or wood their outside surface was apparently seamless and perfectly smooth . and they shone in the dark as if coated with luminous paint . in shape they were boat like , but they were invariably decked over . for when at full speed it could not have been convenient , even if safe . for any on board to remain on the upper deck , their propelling and steering gear could be brought into use at either end .
then he burst out laughing , for that he called fun . the others joined in -- the whole party shouted and cried , while the hounds barked . while the poor girl was falling she happily caught one of the branches of the willow tree . by the help of which she held herself over the water . and as soon as the baron with his company and the dogs had disappeared through the gate .
but only for a moment was he to enjoy the unclouded delight of his new rank . raising himself from the arms of the king . he saw a rider hastening over the plain in the direction of the hill . the traveller and his horse presented a strange appearance . the animal , either from obstinacy or fatigue .
not long afterwards the two sisters went to angle in the brook , meaning to catch fish for dinner . as they were drawing near the water they perceived something . looking like a large grasshopper , springing towards the stream , as if it were going in . they hurried up to see what it might be , and found that it was the dwarf . `` where are you going ? '' said [person] , `` surely you will not jump into the water ? ''
but her father did not hear her , and instead of answering he sprang up and began drawing on the soft earth before the cave a deep . deep circle , and he ran for the long stick that had carried his game bag over his shoulder . and in the middle of the earth circle he set the stick . [female] and her mother , understanding little but trusting much , sat by his side . and together in the hot , white night the three watched the shadow of the stick travel on the dial that they had made .
annette 's home , which the two tired little travellers reached at last . was a quaint cottage , the steep moss grown roof looking twice the height of its walls . over the door grew a twisted pear tree , and all the ground around it . excepting the garden patch in a sheltered spot behind . was one waving mass of heather , strewn with gray boulders of mossy rock .
the brothers looked shyly at their mother 's friend . was it possible that she had still other rings besides those on her fingers ? could she have other gems besides those which sparkled in the chains about her neck ? when the simple out door meal was over , a servant brought the casket from the house . the lady opened it , ah , how those jewels dazzled the eyes of the wondering boys !
those who felt the care and the foreboding most deeply were [male] the poet and his wife . the fair and simple [female] , she who gathered the apples that kept age from the dwellers in [male] . [male] ceased to tell his never-ending tale , then one day . overcome by the fear and the foreboding that was creeping through [male] . [male] slipped down [male] , the world tree .
the intendant of the gardens was so overjoyed to find his adopted children so accomplished in all the perfections of body and mind . and that they so well requited the expense he had been at in their education . that he resolved to be at a still greater : for as he had till then been content only with his lodge at the entrance of the garden . and kept no country house , he purchased a country seat at a short distance from the city . surrounded by a large tract of arable land , meadows , and woods .
the damsel was so much in love with the prince . and so eager to escape from her captivity , that she consented to trust herself to him . and one night they escaped from her palace and went straight towards the desert where dwelt the dragon [female] . they agreed on the way that the girl should find out what the dragon 's talisman was . that they might destroy him that way if they could do it no other .
over them stood the chief imp , whose business it was to see that none failed in his duty . or gossiped unduly with his neighbors , and so deeply engaged in their several tasks were one and all . that none heard the sound of approaching footsteps . none knew that any but themselves were near , till quite by accident the chief imp raised his head and saw within the doorway of the chamber the ruddy form of prince [male] standing . and by his side the grey shadow witch .
then with his anger satisfied , the wind rushed back to his chimney . shrieking and howling with glee at the punishment that he had dealt out to those who had offended him . princess white flame , so pale that she could scarcely be discerned . quivered and flickered where the wind had rudely thrown her , too weak to cry out . she only sighed faintly , and sank still lower upon the ashes .
her dream placed her , alone , in this room . and there entered a grave looking man , having something very remarkable in his countenance . which impressed her , as a fine portrait sometimes will , with a haunting sense of character and individuality . in his hand this man carried a wand . about the length of an ordinary walking cane .
the apparent everydayness of it all to them was what struck the observer most . the young women brushing away the flies touched and turned the fast blackening hands of the corpse to note the rapid changes . almost always there were small children standing in the doorway looking into that blackened , swollen face . and they turned away only to play or to loll about their mothers necks . always there were women bending over other women 's heads . carefully parting the hair and scanning it , women lay asleep stretched in the shade .
then the wondering bees led him to their queen . and when he had told his tale , and begged their forgiveness . it was gladly given ; and all strove to show him that he was loved and trusted . then he asked if they could tell him where the air spirits dwelt . for he must not forget dear [male] ; and to his great joy the queen said .
thereupon everybody began closing their doors and windows . and , as it was with the others , so it was with [male] stuck 's house . it had , like all the rest , to be shut up as tight as a jug . but [male] stuck was not satisfied with that ; not he . he was for seeing the princess , and he was bound he would do so .
graceful threw himself on the pavement of the temple of [male] . and , after thanking [male] , fell asleep , with [male] at his feet . wounded , bleeding , and silent , the sleep was not long . graceful was up before daybreak , which seemed long in coming , on descending the steps of the temple he saw the ants . who had raised a heap of sand and were bringing grain from the new harvest .
then the bird sang , its song was truly wonderful . high and clear , as [male] had heard it from outside , but now that he could see the bird caged he did not like the song so well . it was all too sad , the little posies swung in their cases . the bird sang up stairs , and the beautiful wicked witch played and danced . and laughed at all his searching , she would do nothing to help him find the door .
the fairy bore this name because her beauty was so dazzling that it was hardly possible to endure the brilliancy of it . and the grandeur of her soul quite equalled her extreme loveliness . the queen arrived in a vast plain , and perceived , at a great distance . a large tower ; but although it was in sight . it was very long before she could approach it .
after i had learned my exercises , and that the king my father granted me such liberty as suited my dignity . i went regularly every year to see my uncle , at whose court i diverted myself during a month or two . and then returned again to my father 's , these several journies gave occasion of contracting a very firm and particular friendship between the prince my cousin and myself . the last time i saw him , he received me with greater demonstrations of tenderness than he had done at any time before . and resolving one day to give me a treat .
a drawing in the harleian mss , in the british museum is shewn on page 25 . illustrating a saxon mansion in the ninth or tenth century , there is the hall in the centre . with `` chamber '' and `` bower '' on either side ; there being only a ground floor . as in the earlier roman houses , according to mr. [male] . f.s.a. , who has written on the subject of anglo saxon manners and customs .
the young [female] ran quickly to a spot where , only the day before . she had seen a great many flowers , these , however , were now a little past their bloom . and wishing to give her friends the freshest and loveliest blossoms . she strayed farther into the fields , and found some that made her scream with delight . never had she met with such exquisite flowers before -- violets , so large and fragrant .
the demon dragged him to the wheel of life and he returned to earth in the shape of a girl . he was often ill , had to take medicine continually , and was pricked and burned with hot needles . yet he never uttered a sound , gradually he grew into a beautiful [male] . but since he never spoke , he was known as the dumb maid . a scholar finally took him for his bride .
she felt much better after eating and stood for quite a while watching the little fountain play and splash . away in the distance she heard a dog bark . and at the edge of the village she saw a tiny newsboy and with him a tiny dog . no bigger than a capital letter , under his arm he carried tiny newspapers no bigger than postage stamps . she was just going to stretch out , when she saw a policeman coming toward her just as fast as he could walk .
thus attired , she went forth to the throne room to greet the suitor who awaited her . the king was well pleased with her appearance and smiled encouragement to her . but alas for his hopes , the princess [female] burst into tears before the court . thereby offending the suitor and bringing down her father 's wrath . he bade the weeping [male] withdraw and commanded his youngest daughter to appear in her place .
the young man stayed there a few days , during which he received the raja 's right hand ring . and the pot and spoon , in recognition of his highness 's gratitude to him for having delivered his son . he then returned , on reaching the top of the spring he found his friends . the dog and the cat , waiting for him . they told one another all they had experienced since they had last seen each other .
all the inhabitants of the country round about stood in great crowds around the castle . almost under the very windows , to see the princess receive the suitors ; and as each stepped into the hall . his power of speech seemed to desert him . like the light of a candle that is blown out , then the princess would say . `` he is of no use , away with him out of the hall ! ''
at last they all went to work , the maidens rode -- that is , they were put in a wheelbarrow . and that was a distinction ; but still they were called `` hand rammers . '' [female] -- , they said , as they were bumped upon the pavement . [female] -- , and they were very nearly pronouncing the whole word [female] . but they broke off short , and swallowed the last syllable ; for after mature deliberation they considered it beneath their dignity to protest .
at this account , [male] ad deen was thunder struck . any other man would have sunk under the shock ; but a sudden hope of disappointing his rival soon roused his spirits . and he bethought himself of the lamp . which had on every emergence been so useful to him ; and without venting his rage in empty words against the sultan . the vizier , or his son , he only said .
by a violent effort [male] recovered the use of his limbs . took hold of the crucible , and sloped it , so as to pour out the gold . but instead of a liquid stream there came out , first a pair of pretty little yellow legs . then some coat tails , then a pair of arms stuck akimbo . and finally the well-known head of his friend the mug .
he bent his head above mr. [male] to hear what he had to say . `` follow me , '' said mr. [male] coldly ; and without more ado he turned and led the way into the depths of the forest . the giant following him wonderingly , they came before long to an old house with all the blinds drawn save at one window . through which the beams of a lamp shone dimly . mr. [male] opened the front door , which creaked angrily , he lighted a hall lamp so that he and the giant might find their way up a flight of stairs in safety .
perhaps it was to [male] , he suggested . a secret satisfaction to crown the history of his bad married life with the scandal of his absence from the funeral of his neglected and abused wife . [male] had taken on himself the direction of the melancholy preparations . he had ordered a grave to be opened for his sister beside her mother 's . in shackleton churchyard , at the other side of the moor .
and he got out of the basket , and cudgelled the parson out of the house . when the two heard that , they were frightened to death . and ran away in great haste , when the king came home they told him that the queen had been delivered of a dog . then the king said , `` what god does , is well done , '' but a fisherman who dwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while he was still alive . and as his wife had no children , they reared him .
she educated her daughter honey bee with a charming wisdom . having brought the child up only to do good , she never denied her any pleasure . whereupon [male] was seized with an ardent desire to hit [male] also with his spade . but as this presented insurmountable difficulties , he resigned himself to do what was easier . and that was to stand with his nose against the trunk of a big tree and weep torrents .
so the two rode on , he making merry with gay talk . as became a courteous knight , and she , with much modest show of bashfulness . after a while they came in their journey to two fair trees . which spread their branches across the road , lovely trees they seemed . and fair was the shade which they cast .
weeks passed by , still he was a prisoner in the cavern . serving the [male] old giant , who was very [male] . and hard to please , one evening he came home in great good humor . and , while he ate his supper , he talked and laughed with [male] very pleasantly . he told how that day he had given a quantity of gold to some miners .
in one of the many `` co eds , '' or places with this name . in ancient and forest covered wales , there was a man who had one of the most beautiful mares in all the world . yet great misfortunes befell both this co-ed mare and her owner . every night , on the first of may , the mare gave birth to a pretty little colt . yet no one ever saw , or could ever tell what became of any one .
not that the child was a fool , had she been . the wise woman would have only pitied and loved her . instead of feeling sick when she looked at her . she had very fair abilities , and were she once but made humble . would be capable not only of doing a good deal in time , but of beginning at once to grow to no end .
hoofs and carriage wheels rolled up a wonderful dust . which being caught in one of those eddies that whirl the dust up into a column . on the calmest day , enveloped the children for a moment . and passed whirling on towards [male] , the carriage . as they fancied , driving in the centre of it .
all this was soon told to the king up at the palace , and when he heard what sorrow the woman was in . and the reason of it , he said that he himself would take the child and see if he could not save it . the baby was a boy , and the king took him at once and brought him up as his own son until the lad grew up . then one day he begged to have leave to go out with his father to fish . he had a strong desire to do this , he said .
she was so lovely that painters came from many countries just to see her face . and , if possible , be allowed to make a picture of her , and one of these portraits found its way to the court of a king who was a distant cousin of her father . and who had heard the strange things said of the princess , he was very angry about it . for he had two sons , and he was afraid of their falling in love with the beautiful face . so he ordered the picture to be destroyed before the elder prince .
now , for a long while [female] lay in the coffin and never changed . but looked as if she were asleep , for she was still as white as snow . as red as blood , and her hair was as black as [female] . it happened , however , that one day a king 's son rode through the wood and up to the dwarfs house , which was near it , he saw on the mountain the coffin .
the seventeen pendle forest witches condemned in lancashire obtained a reprieve and were sent to [location] . where they were examined by his majesty himself and the council . a witch called [male] cox . aged about seventy years , was indicted at taunton . in somerset , in 1663 , for transforming herself into a [female] and for other sorcery .
then at the tap of the fairy 's wand up gushed fresh water from the rock . blue bird dropped a long stalk of grass strung with raspberries like red beads . skip scattered his best nuts ; and [male] came lumbering up with a great piece of honey comb . folded in vine leaves , he had found a wild bees nest , and this was his surprise . he was so small and [male] , and his little eyes twinkled so kindly .
the dryad sat at the foot of the tree . at her house door , which she had locked . and whose key had thrown away , so young , so fair , the stars saw her . and blinked at her , the gas lamps saw her , and gleamed and beckoned to her . how delicate she was , and yet how blooming , -- a child .
`` i , '' said fin , who stood in front of him . then began a terrible battle between fin and the old woman 's son . [male] came down from the [female] to help fin . she bit and tore his enemy 's back . stripping the skin and flesh from his head to his heels .
`` follow me , '' cried the [female] , and it ran through the wood till it came to a pool of water . and at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold was lying . and the star child took the piece of yellow gold , and put it in his wallet . and hurried to the city , but the leper saw him coming , and ran to meet him . and knelt down and cried , `` give me a piece of money or i shall die of hunger . ''
he put up first one hand and then the other to each side of his face to make sure if he were not dreaming a horrible nightmare . no , sure enough there was now a great [male] on the right side of his face as on the left . the demons had all disappeared , and there was nothing for him to do but to return home . he was a pitiful sight , for his face . with the two large lumps , one on each side , looked just like a japanese gourd .
[female] 's mother was very glad to get the money . but she did not like him to run any risk for her . but after a time [male] made up his mind to go again to the giant 's castle . so he climbed the beanstalk once more , and blew the horn at the giant 's gate . the giantess soon opened the door ; she was very stupid .
the youngest brother came home , and his brothers . who were sitting over a good supper , laughed at him , because he had taken only a few copper coins that day . and they told him he should have no supper . but when he began to shake his purse and scatter gold coins all about . they jumped up from the table , and began picking them up eagerly .

one of them was very beautiful and a great help about the house . while the other was ugly and idle , the mother loved only the ugly one . for she was her own child . she cared so little for the other daughter that she made her do all the hard work . every day the poor girl would sit beside the spring and spin and spin .

then he forsook his friends and intimates . and denying himself to his women and his family . shut himself up in the house of lamentations . where he passed his time in weeping for his sons . to return to queen [female] , when she had brought [female] into the palace .
and the third time the door will open , and you may go in . and [male] was just going on , when he remembered what he had to do . so he out with the good brand , that never struck in vain . and off went the hen wife 's head , and the third time the door did open . and he went in , and it closed with a click .

when the boy heard this he was so scared that he jumped up instantly and began playing again . by and by father bear came clambering down the mountain wall . the boy was wakened by his tearing away stone and gravel as he swung himself into the old mine . the boy was afraid to move much ; but he managed to stretch himself and turn over . so that he could see the big bear , he was a frightfully coarse .
`` oh , good lord , '' muttered sir [male] , staring hard at the wall . papa -- it 's about the dragon . and i have been wrong , very wrong , yes ; i know i have . i was foolish , she was silent again , was she going to cry , after all ? the baron shot a nervous glance at her from the corner of his eye .
next morning , before the giant set out with his goats . he again told the prince that he would find he was an easy master . all he had to do that day was to catch the giant 's horse that was feeding on the mountain side . and having set him this task , the giant said that if the prince opened one of the doors he would kill him . then he took his staff , and was soon out of sight .

but he was so old and shrivelled , and so very rheumatic in the legs . that it demanded more imagination than our watering place can usually muster . to believe him ; therefore , except the master of the `` rooms '' ( who to this hour wears knee breeches . and who confirmed the statement with tears in his eyes ) . nobody did believe in the little [female] old gentleman .
princess , said she to [female] . as soon as they were gone , you , who have heard my story . must know that it was at the sight of the talisman that i swooned . this is the thing which was the fatal cause of my losing my dear husband , prince [male] . but , as it caused our separation , so i foresee it will be the means of our sudden meeting .

the lad , too , had something to drink after the girls had left and put a tumbler . together with a twig that he broke off a tree . in his bag ; the tree trembled , and the noise was heard all over the forest . the youngest girl noticed it and warned her sisters that some one was after them . but they felt so safe that they only laughed at her .

those rites , ceremonies , and customs . which are the most commonly observed , and which most persistently keep their place amongst us . are far from being of modern origin , thus , the custom of jovially celebrating the commencement of the new year . or of devoting certain particular days to festivity , is still universally followed in every country in the world . the practice of sending presents on new year 's day is to be found among civilised nations in the east as well as in our own country .

the nurse 's words proved to be true , no one had ever seen a little girl like the princess . nothing troubled her , she never shed one tear . if she were angry she would stamp her feet and her eyes would flash . but she never wept , and she loved nobody . when her little dog died she laughed outright ; when the king her father went to the war it did not grieve her .

taking advantage of the dismay and confusion thus brought about . [female] dodged between the legs of a gigantic guard who was on the point of clutching him . butted his head into the stomach of a second , who in falling upset a third . over whom a fourth and fifth stumbled ; and , having by this time got to the brink of the broad and deep ditch beside the road . he crossed it with a flying leap .

ebn thaher , who was in the gallery . being surprised at this accident , turned towards the prince of [location] . but instead of finding him standing , and looking through the window as before , he was extremely amazed to discover him lying at his feet motionless . this convinced him of the violence of the prince 's passion for [male] . and he admired that strange effect of sympathy .

the three kings , too , rose hastily , they would have parted them or more harm was done . but they could not , for [male] and [male] were beside themselves with rage . when the king of rhineland could not stint the strife . he , also , smote many a deep wound through the shining harness of his foemen . well he showed his hardihood , then stark [male] came into the battle .
the king of this beautiful island had one son . for whom a life of adventure had been foretold at his birth . this so frightened his father and mother that in order to comfort them a fairy . who happened to be present at the time , produced a little pebble which she told them to keep for the prince till he grew up . as by putting it in his mouth he would become invisible .

now the king knew nothing about fruits except that they were good to eat . and , as for seasons , he asked for whatever fruit he wanted whenever he wanted it . and saw that he got it ; so to him [male] 's guess was like a miracle . and clear proof not only of his wisdom but of his innocence . for it was a pomegranate that he had put into the box .

when a miner 's song reached him . deadened by distance , it seemed to him to issue from the depths of the rocks . by dint of practice , his sense of hearing had acquired a fine subtlety . and sometimes putting his ear to the rugged walls , he listened with so much attention that he could catch the faintest unknown and inexplicable sounds . it was perhaps only the wrathful [male] of some imprisoned spring .
when she had done that she went away to the pig sty , but all the way as she went she wept . and was very sorrowful , then she put on the wooden gown , and walked to the king 's palace . when she got there she went into the kitchen and begged for a place . saying that her name was [female] woodengown . the cook told her that she might have a place and leave to stay there at once and wash up .

then the lad ran back and jumped into the boat and pushed it clear of the roof . and none too soon , for as the fire burned deeper into the heart . the monster felt the burn of it and began to writhe and twist . then he gave a great [male] that sent the waters surging back out of his body and into the sea again in a mighty flood .

martin took the ring , and , having thanked the king . he set out on the same road by which he had come down into the under world . when he had regained the upper air he started for his old home . and having found his mother still living in the old house where he had left her . they settled down together very happily , so uneventful was their life that it almost seemed as if it would go on in this way always .
now the grand hunting party comes back , and the castle upon the twelve golden pillars had disappeared . to the great disappointment of those gentlemen as did not see it before . that poor silly [male] is threatened by taking his beautiful young wife from him . for taking them in in the way he did . but the gentleman at last made an agreement with him .
well , this was just like a whirlpool of air , even the giant himself could hardly keep his legs against it . then he tossed [male] up , and the airy whirlpool seized her and carried her . as if on a tide of water , always round and round in narrowing circles . till she was sucked down into the hollow hill . even as she went , she seemed to remember the hill .
the lists grew amazingly , long before noon we had to get new papers . by night we had every child that we knew . save stitchy branchitt , he had a railroad pass to poynette . and he favoured the out of town celebration , but the personal considerations of economic conditions were as usual sufficient to swing the event . and the next morning i suppose that twenty five or thirty of us .
eliza was still gazing at the scene , when mountains . forests , and castles melted away , and twenty stately churches rose in their stead . with high towers and pointed gothic windows , she even fancied she could hear the tones of the organ . but it was the music of the murmuring sea . as they drew nearer to the churches .
he walked towards the castle , which he saw at the end of a long avenue he had entered . and he was somewhat surprised to find that none of his people had been able to follow him . the trees having closed up again as soon as he had passed , nevertheless , he continued to advance . a young prince , inspired by love , is always courageous , he came to a large fore court . where everything he saw might well have frozen his blood with terror .
the prince knocked , and a rasping woman 's voice told him to enter . [male] opened the door , and found himself in a smoke begrimed kitchen . in the presence of a hideous old woman who was warming her skinny hands at a fire . the prince offered to become her servant , and the old hag told him she was badly in want of one . and he seemed to be just the person to suit her .
`` wonderful , '' cried the farmer , starting up and opening the oven door . and there lay all the nice things hidden by the farmer 's wife . but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under the table . the woman dared not say anything ; so she placed the things before them . and they both ate of the fish .
there are no olives in the isle of ebene . and those which are exported hence are a good commodity there : you know i have plenty of them . take what you will ; fill fifty pots , half with the gold dust . and half with olives ; which being a common merchandise from this city to that island . none will mistrust that there is any thing but olives in the pots .
the first who saw her was the kitchen maid , and she ordered her to be gone for an ugly witch . the next was the herd boy , and he threw her a bone over his shoulder . but [male] charity , hearing the noise . came out from her seat at the foot of the lowest table . and asked the old woman to take her share of the supper .
he taught him to notice the chamois . in order to learn from them how to jump , so as to alight steadily upon the feet . if there was no resting place in the clefts of the rock for the foot . he must know how to support himself with the elbow . and be able to climb by means of the muscles of the thigh and calf .
two whole years passed since the marriage of the prince and princess . and during that time they had two children . the first , a daughter , was called `` dawn , '' while the second . a boy , was named `` day , '' because he seemed even more beautiful than his sister . many a time the queen told her son that he ought to settle down in life .
here 's a dwarf upon a snail , take him off at once to jail ! `` never mind ; we can only try , '' said the queen . so she sent out messengers into all the world . and sent the picture of the princess everywhere , and proclaimed that the beautiful princess niente . and no less than three quarters of the kingdom would be given to the prince that could find the princess and bring her home .
i looked up from the book and who should stand before me . just about to depart again , but the old man from trollhätta , whilst i had wandered about . right up to the shores of siljan , he had continually made voyages on the canal . seen the sluices and manufactories , studied steam in all its possible powers of service . and spoke about a projected railway in [location] , between the [male] and [male] .
page 294. -- the `` fire which does not burn '' is everywhere in [location] one of the attributes of [person] . in many parts of the deccan are to be found shrines consecrated to one of the local gods . who has been brahminically recognized as a local manifestation of [person] , where the annual festival of the divinity was . within the last few years , kept by lighting huge fires , through which devotees ran or jumped . attributing their escape from burning to the interposition of [person] .
`` ah , a dainty morsel , '' said he . `` which will certainly please his majesty : what wish you for the whole basket ? '' [male] set a high price upon them . and the bargain was soon struck , the kitchen master gave the basket to his slave . and went his way : meantime little [male] stole away .
the dnieper , [female] , and dvina used once to be living people . the dnieper was a boy , and the [male] and dvina his sisters . while they were still in childhood they were left complete orphans . and , as they had not a crust to eat , they were obliged to get their living by daily labor beyond their strength . `` when was that ? '' very long ago , say the old folks ; beyond the memory even of our great grandfathers .
when the gryphoness reached the land of the lovely lakes . she wandered all that day and the next night . but she saw nothing of those for whom she was looking . the princess and the absolute fool journeyed on until near the close of the afternoon . when the sky began to be overcast , and it looked like rain .
`` lion , lion , tear him to pieces ! '' cried the mighty voice from the depths of the palace . when the youth came up to the two beasts , again the youth went a hunting . and again he caught the eye of the [male] . but the sight of the youth this third time so touched the fatherly heart of the [male] that they carried him back to his palace half fainting .
geraldine yielded to the invitation in silence . she wished to discover every possible detail which could make her understand how her father . as popular with men as with women , and with every custom of good manners . had often sought this brute , doubtless it was to obtain money . probably her father had died in debt to the man .
the merchant would rather not have gone , as he did not like leaving his daughters at home . but he could not refuse to obey the king 's commands . and with a heavy heart he returned home to say farewell to them . before he left , he took three pots of basil . and gave one to each girl , saying , i am going a journey .
there ages ago in the silent swamp shaded with monster trees . one thin layer of plants after another was formed , year after year . to become the coal we now value so much . in lancashire , busy lancashire , the same thing was happening . and even in the middle of yorkshire and derbyshire the sea must have come up and washed a silent shore where a vast forest spread out over at least 700 or 800 square miles .
thus speaking , the king , with another magnificent bow . led the way upstairs to a little turret room , in a deserted part of the palace . bidding the tradesmen enter , he showed them a large collection of miscellaneous things . an old cap or two , a pair of boots of a sort long out of fashion . an old broadsword , a shabby old persian rug .
about four hundred years ago travelers returning to [location] brought back wondrous tales of rich gold mines in the country of [location] . and after a while the people of spain sent an army to fight the mexicans and [person] them of their riches . when the spanish army reached the city of [location] . which stood in the midst of a great plain , they were struck with wonder at the beauty and grandeur of all they saw . gold seemed to be everywhere , gold , gold , gold !
we must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand . no , indeed ; the most singular flowers and plants grow there ; the leaves and stems of which are so pliant . that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life . fishes , both large and small , glide between the branches . as birds fly among the trees here upon land .
so [male] followed him , and presently they came to the edge of an opening in the middle of the forest . and there , sure enough , was the kyrofatalapynx , with one of his great red tails coiled around an immense oak tree . and the other around a huge rock , he sat with his elephantine legs gathered up under him . as if he were about to spring over the tree tops , but he had no such idea . in his great hands , as big as travelling trunks , he held a long iron bar .
`` hold fast , [male] , '' shouted his uncle , and [male] clung to the tree . as they were going home in the best of humors . uncle whistling one of his songs , they suddenly heard a strange noise not far off . they looked round them , and saw that the snow on the side of the mountain was all in motion . it waved up and down , broke into pieces , and came down with a roar like thunder .
the fish swam to and fro , making the most wonderful movements , but at last he became quite still . after a while , a flash of lightning seemed to pass through him . and then the daylight approached , and a voice cried out , `` i declare here is the tin soldier . '' the fish had been caught , taken to the market and sold to the cook . who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife .
elined departed from the castle , but she did not go beyond the town . it was in her mind to lie hidden for as long a time as it would take her to go to caerleon and return therefrom . meanwhile , going about disguised , she would be able to see what the many lords were doing who would essay to woo the countess . seeing that , lovely and rich as she was , she would be a splendid prize . and things happened as she had foreseen .
here [female] put on his grand air , and was shown to the apartment he had ordered from genoa . [male] meekly followed ; and [male] brought up the rear with the luggage . [male] felt as if he had got into a fairy tale when he found himself in a fine parlor where he could only sit and stare about him . while his master refreshed in the chamber beyond , and the man ordered dinner . a large closet was given the boy to sleep in , with a mattress and blanket .
to this day victor and [female] rule the kingdom . and such is the charm of the [female] , -- so like the pure heart of the queen . that the people are becoming [female] and good , in the strange island of iceland . thrown up , by fire , from the depths of the sea . there once lived a lad who worshipped the god [male] .
overjoyed at having obtained what they wanted , the counsellors sent envoys far and wide to get portraits of all the most famous beauties of every country . the artists were very busy and did their best , but , alas , nobody could even pretend that any of the ladies could compare for a moment with the late queen . at length , one day , when he had turned away discouraged from a fresh collection of pictures . the king 's eyes fell on his adopted daughter . who had lived in the palace since she was a baby .
when he awoke , neither wood nor fire was to be seen . and he did not know where he was , he rubbed his eyes . and began to recall the events of the night , thinking he must have been dreaming . but for all that , he could not make out how he came to be in this place . suddenly a loud noise struck on his ear .
across the plain , one saw the blue sea rolling to meet the bluer sky . sending fresh airs and soft rains to keep valrose green and beautiful even through the summer heat . only one ugly thing marred the lovely landscape , and that was the factory . with its tall chimneys , its red walls , and ceaseless bustle . but old ilex trees tried to conceal its ugliness ; the smoke curled gracefully from its chimney tops .
when he came in sight of the island . the sides of the boat were covered with blossoms . the mast had put out a wealth of petals . and the sail and rigging were covered with flowering vines . then , as he passed between the high rocks and entered the harbour .
he was as big as twenty elephants . and he was green , covered with shining scales , his eyes glowed like the head lights of two engines . and revolved horribly in his head , steam and fire belched from his huge mouth . and he snapped his long , sharp teeth disgustingly , he was a terrifying sight as he writhed toward [male] . dreadfully he roared , lashing right and left with his tail , which uprooted the trees and bushes and dislodged the rocks on either hand till they came tumbling down in an avalanche .
she was [female] so that he turned instantly . and they went back to the pilleygreen lodges . getting wild raspberries for supper on the way . and after supper they sang songs . one against the other , each sweeter than the last , and told stories by turns .
well , my dear , it was a beautiful sight to see the king standing with his mouth open . looking at his poor old goose flying as light as a lark , and better than ever she was . and when she lit at his feet , patted her on the head . and `` ma vourneen , '' says he . `` but you are the darlint o ', the world . ''
meanwhile [female] and [female] had stuck their flags through the holes in the rocks . so that they were visible from the outside , now little [male] had gone straight home . and had told awful tales of the games the others were up to . and he conducted the four mothers to the dragon 's gorge where they wandered up and down looking for their boys . [male] observed the flags sticking up on the rocks .
but his powers were by no means exhausted , he was a mighty king . the mightiest of all in the enchanted island , he believed -- and ways to destroy his enemies were numerous . `` send for a hundred of my gray men , '' he suddenly cried . and a courtier ran at once to summon them . the gray men would obey his orders without question .
ah , what have i done ? he exclaimed , the young wretches shall pay for it . and that at once , he threw a jugful of water in his wife 's face . and having brought her to , said , quick , fetch me my seven league boots . that i may go after them and catch them . he set out , and after running in every direction , came at last upon the track of the poor children .
smash , crash , the precious jar lay in fifty pieces of the stone floor . and the young man stood staring at the result of his folly with bulging eyes . while his friends roared and laughed and shouted louder than ever over his mishap , and again his treasure and his gay life were gone . but what had been hard for him to do before was easier now , at the end of a week he was back at the old man 's house . rapping on the door , this time the old man asked him never a word .
when the lord mayor saw there was no help for it . he sent him away with a trader who had come thither with a ship . and he was to be cabin boy on board her . he told his wife he had sold the boy for a roll of tobacco . but before he went the lord mayor 's daughter broke her ring into two bits and gave the boy one bit .
but parker made it clear at once that that was not at all in accordance with her ideas . and so earned the lifelong gratitude of [female] , and parker too spoke out for drives . and suggested with an air of rightness that left nothing else to be done . the hire of a carriage and pair for the season . to the equal delight of the buntings and the sea lady .
heracles proceeded to the forest of nemea . where , having discovered the lion 's lair , he attempted to pierce him with his arrows . but finding these of no avail he felled him to the ground with his club . and before the animal had time to recover from the terrible blow . { 239 } [male] seized him by the neck and .
do you see the shimmer of the rainbow . which unites earth to heaven ? so has there been a bridge built between this world and the next . through the night of the grave we gaze upwards beyond the stars to the end of all things . then we glance at the [female] of sorrow . in which are concealed the wings which shall carry america away to eternal happiness , in a village there once lived two men who had the same name .
the boy grew with [male] rapidity . meanwhile the father of the widowed princess insisted that she should marry again . but she was faithful to the memory of her husband and declared that she would only marry the man who could draw the iron bow . many suitors came but they all failed to draw the bow . at length the reputed son of the ghasi woman came and pulling the bow with ease announced himself as the true husband of the princess with whom he lived happily ever after .
recall the quotation previously made from [male] ellis in this connection . evasive or untruthful answers will not do , they only fix the attention more strongly on the subject . and from this fixing of the attention a dangerously morbid interest in things sexual may develop . clearly , parents who would do their full duty by their children have no easy task before them . yet everything combines to show that unless they make a business of parenthood .
' the woman 's loch near dùn can . the highest hill in this island , derives its name from having been the scene of the abduction of a woman by the water horse that haunted it . the big smith , who lived in the neighbourhood , resolved to kill the horse . and by his success he earned himself the title of `` alastair na béisde '' he built a hut close by , with an opening like the syver of a drain .
then suddenly all the carrots that were lying about sprang up , and those that were in the duck pond sprang out of it . they were joined by those in the gardens near , and they came trooping along like an army . they could walk as well in the air as on the ground . and they whirled around [female] and pulled her hair and pinched her arms . till she cried aloud for [female] .
he never played with the other children ; he only met them . when his grandfather sent him out to sell his carvings . and [male] took but little interest in this ; he much preferred to wander about the rocks . or to sit and listen to his grandfather relate about old times and about the inhabitants of meiringen . where he came from , he said that these people had not been there since the beginning of the world .
a knotted [person] of grass is , i think , a common form of taboo sign in parts of new guinea . and dr. [person] refers ( melanesians of british new guinea , pp . 136 to 138 ) to its use by the koita for the [person] of cocoanuts and other trees and firewood . and as part of the protective sign for new gardens . the use of the [person] by the mafulu people .
when a welshman went into england to live , if he were a sister 's son . he usually added a syllable showing this , as in the case of [male] . which means sister 's son , our great [male] used to boast that he could talk [male] . so the living creatures of all sorts in wales . human beings , fairies , and animals took heart and plucked up courage .
thus gloriously arrayed he was soon seen striding { 295 } along , calling the greeks to arms . he now led the troops against the enemy . who were defeated and put to flight until , near the gates of the city . [male] and [male] encountered each other , but here , for the first time throughout his whole career . the courage of the trojan hero deserted him .
he was found ; and the fairy made him into a most respectable coachman . with the finest [female] imaginable , she afterward took six lizards from behind the pumpkin frame . and changed them into six footmen , all in splendid livery . who immediately jumped up behind the carriage , as if they had been footmen all their days . `` well , [female] , now you can go to the ball . ''
when [male] saw [male] there he knew that part of his [male] was ended . now he had to get [male] out of [location] and away to [male] . he stayed no more with the giant maid . but flew up into the high rocks of the cave , [female] wept for the flight of her pet . but she ceased to search and to call and went away from the cave , then [female] .
on arriving at our destination , we were conducted by a little gentleman clad in rich apparel to the hall of brotherhood . which we found was crowded with the principal inhabitants of the city . the prince was conducted to the chair of honour—a kind of throne . and he motioned me to occupy the vacant seat on his right hand . presently the prince asked the governor of the city if peace .
then she threw down another [female] , and a tiny lantern grew in her hand . bright as if it were lit with gold . the darkness crept back deeper into the earth , and the light shone far through the underground passages . [female] was delighted with her lantern , because it showed up all the marvels which had been swallowed by the earth in days of old . in one place she saw lordly castles .
as soon as there was wind enough , off she would fly to the närke plain for a good dance . on days when a [female] swept the plain . [female] had fun , she would stand right in the wind and spin round . her long hair flying up among the clouds and the long trail of her robe sweeping the ground . like a dust cloud , while the whole plain lay spread out under her .
the wife was charmed with her present , and , for a few days could not look into the mirror often enough . for you must remember , that , as this was the first time she had seen a mirror . so , of course , it was the first time she had ever seen the reflection of her own pretty face . but she considered such a wonderful thing far too precious for every day use . and soon shut it up in its box again , and put it away carefully among her most valued treasures .
invisible in his helmet of darkness , [male] drew near . and saw that the fragile white figure was shaken by shivering sobs , the waves . every few moments , lapped up on her little cold white feet , and he saw that heavy chains held her imprisoned to that chilly rock in the sea . a great anger stirred the heart of [male] . and swiftly he took the helmet from his head and stood beside her .
in a country , far across the sea , there once dwelt a great and mighty prince . he lived in a grand castle , which was full of beautiful furniture . and curious and rare ornaments , and among them was a lovely little glass shoe . which would only fit the tiniest foot imaginable , and as the prince was looking at it one day . it struck him what a dainty little lady she would need to be who wore such a very small shoe .
when the princess of the golden palace heard this she became more trustful . and her heart inclined favourably towards him . so that she willingly consented to become his wife , it happened . however , as they were still journeying on the open sea , that faithful [male] . as he sat in the forepart of the ship and made music .
in deadly terror [female] had sunk back on her seat . tremblingly awaiting the fate that her rashness had called down on her dear ones . they were anxious hours that they spent now in the dark upper room . almost more anxious than those of their flight and of that hard struggle with the waves . at last the morning dawned , a clear sunbeam shot through a hole in the shutter and awoke the boy .
but the old aunty held on to him bravely , and examined him from top to toe . nothing could she find , till she came to the sole of the right foot . and there was a tiny red mark like a burning torch . as soon as aunty saw this she sighed . and whispered a word in the baby 's ear .
while this was passing , poor [female] , overcome with a fear she could not recover from . fled with all her might , and had already gone far beyond the forest of tigers . notwithstanding those animals had used all their endeavours to detain her . for they were all fond of her . and several of them were even in love with her ; but she had forced her way through every obstacle .
we must first go to the sea as the distillery . or the place from which water is drawn up invisibly , in its purest state . into the air ; and we must go chiefly to the seas of the tropics . because here the sun shines most directly all the year round . sending heat waves to shake the water particles asunder .
next morning he drove the cattle still farther . and came to green woods and a strong wall , putting his back to the wall . he threw in a great piece of it . and going in , threw out another piece , then he drove the five golden cows and the bull without horns to the land inside . ate sweet apples himself , and threw down [male] ones to the cattle .
at night he told [male] what the padre had said . [male] frowned , and answered , `` the padre should not ask too much ; but this shall be as he desires . '' again they went out in the twilight , and before the rising of [location] . two more foundation stones were laid , at daybreak the padre arose . and hastened to see if the task had been accomplished , and before his wondering eyes .
without adverting to the little fraternal affection his brother had shewn for him . [male] went into the cave to find something to enshroud his remains . and having loaded one of his asses with them , covered them over with wood . the other two asses he loaded with bags of gold . covering them with wood also as before ; and then bidding the door shut , came away .
a young man was returning home after a day 's hunting . he was the son of the knight of a neighbouring castle . and his name was sir [male] of ruppertshain . it was a hot afternoon ; the sunlight made a chequered pattern through the forest trees . his bag was heavy with game , and he whistled merrily as he strode between the oak trees and bracken [male] .
now , it happened about this time that the merchant . mark , came to the monastery in the course of a journey . the monks were very polite to him and showed him their house and church and all they had . when he went into the church the choir was singing . and one voice was so clear and beautiful , that he asked who it belonged to .
on the death of [female] cantillon . [male] was determined to satisfy himself about the truth of this story of the old church under the sea . so when he heard the news of the old fellow 's death . away with him to ardfert , where flory was laid out in high style . and a beautiful corpse he made , the mourners departed .
`` you have asked , '' said she , `` for the only thing from which i can not part , '' and then she bade her maids bring her her jewel casket . and she drew out diamonds , and rubies . and pearls , and offered them , all or any , to [male] . the lightning shone on them and made them shine and flash .
for a great wish had come upon him to walk beside the sea . to listen to the roll and boom of long , grey breakers . to gaze on an unfruitful , desolate wilderness of waters ; and to forget in those sights all that he could forget . and if he could not forget then to remember all that he should remember , he was thus gazing and brooding when one day he observed a coracle drawing to the shore . a young girl stepped from it and walked to him among black boulders and patches of yellow sand .
well , well , the squire would see what he could do ; and he told the master thief a day when he would be taking a ride on a great common where they drilled the troops . so the master thief soon got hold of an old worn-out [male] of a mare . and set to work , and made traces and collar of withies and broom twigs . and bought an old beggarly cart and a great cask , after that he told an old beggar woman . he would give her ten dollar if she would get inside the cask .
they are the knights errant of early european chivalry which was a much deeper and more real inspiration than the carefully cultivated artificial chivalry of centuries later . [male] , diarmuit , [male] all pay with their lives for their obedience to the dictates of honour and conscience . and in women , for whom in those early days [male] of self was the only way of heroism . the surrender even of eternal [male] was only the sublimation of honour and chivalry . and this was the heroism of the countess [male] .
so he took leave of them and turned back . and [male] [location] and his wife and father journeyed on . night and day , with their troops . till they drew near the capital of the green country . as soon as the news of their coming became known , the folk decorated the city .
on his arrival , having informed his father of his adventures . the old sultan , eager to gratify his son , approved of his additional marriage with the fair [male] . and dispatched an embassy to mherejaun , who by this time was in the territory of sind . laying it waste with fire and sword . no troops scarcely being opposed to his sudden invasion , he received the ambassador with mortifying haughtiness .
they led in turn to stories of languages and writing . of painting and geometry , of music and of life . the names of these things may not promise good stories to you . but that is only because you do not know them as stories . if you could listen to [male] telling them .
preference was given to the day on which it entered the first quarter . or during the full moon ; the summonses were returnable by moons or quarter moons . that is , every seventh day , the summons was issued four times . after which , if the accused did not appear , he lost the right of counterplea . or was nonsuited , the salic law allowed but two summonses before a count .
not till he reached the top of the long hill a mile away . did he slacken his lively pace ; then climbing a bank . he lay down to rest under some olive trees , and ate his grapes as he watched the sun rise . travellers always left the falcone inn early to enjoy the morning freshness . so [male] knew that signor [male] would soon appear .
once upon a time the cock , the [female] . and the black cock bought a cow between them . but when they came to share it , and couldn t agree which should buy the others out , they settled among them that he who woke first in the morning should have the cow . he crew , and so pleased was he that in his excitement he awoke the [male] .
a lamp was burning brightly in a bracket on a wall of the room . on the earthen floor , near the center . the old ragpicker was kneeling before a brazier containing a brisk fire . over which hung an iron pot , her bag lay on the floor beside her . flat and limp ; it was evidently empty , presently she stopped stirring , and sniffing the contents of the pot nodded her head as if satisfied .
at this the dragon grew rather frightened , but in a moment had recollected his eighteen heads . and was bold again , `` come on , '' he cried , rearing himself up and preparing to [male] all his heads at once at [male] . but [male] jumped underneath , and gave an upward cut so that six of the heads went rolling down . they were the best heads too , and very soon the other twelve lay beside them . then [male] changed the castle into an apple .
and the wind blew fairly seaward from the spanish shore , and the parting was to be but a brief one . for in a few weeks the voyagers would reach their destination . but when they came out upon the high seas , the wind sank . the sea became calm and shining , the stars of heaven gleamed brightly . and they were festive evenings that were spent in the sumptuous cabin .
the captain now assumed the character of a merchant . and conveyed gradually a great many sorts of rich stuffs and fine linen to his lodging from the cavern . but with all the necessary precautions imaginable to conceal the place whence he brought them . in order to dispose of the merchandizes , when he had amassed them together . he took a warehouse , which happened to be opposite to [male] 's .
whenever [male] looked over the duchess shoulder to get a glimpse of [male] . he was always seen there so long as the sun was in the heavens . many times the hearts of the two women stood still when they saw him climb to the highest point of the scaffolding in order to direct the work from there . fate had only to make his foot slip one little inch or decree that a [male] should sting him on the finger to put an end to his existence . the poor mother was doubly anxious because he seemed so unconscious of the risk he ran up there and looked about him even more boldly and self reliantly than usual .
some months later the six brothers resolved to go and visit the raja . so that the princess might not feel that the dog she had married had no friends in the world . off they set and when they reached the raja 's palace they were amazed to find their younger brother and still more so when they heard the story of all that had happened to him . they immediately decided to take vengeance on their wives and when they reached home gave orders for a large well to be dug . when it was ready they told their wives to join in the consecration ceremony which was to ensure a pure and plentiful supply of water .
they took the boys into the wood . and lost them , as they said they should . and came in silence back , alas for them , [male] o my [male] at every step had dropped a crumb . and so retraced the track , while the parents sat mourning their fate he led the boys in at the gate !
`` oh , '' shrieked the imp , starting up in the cradle . and clapping his hands together , i am fifteen hundred years in the world . and i never saw a brewery of egg shells before , the [female] was by this time quite red . and mrs. [female] seizing it . ran furiously towards the cradle ; but somehow or other her foot slipped , and she fell flat on the floor .
in order to discover the man whom the gods intended her to marry . this ball was made of some soft material , wrapped round with a piece of red silk which was covered with variegated figures . worked by the damsel 's own hands and emblematic of the love by which the hearts of husband and wife are bound indissolubly to each other . it was firmly believed by every [male] of this romantic type that the man who was struck by the ball from her fair hands was the one whom heaven had selected as her husband . and no parent would ever dream of refusing to accept a choice made in this way .
soon after this a war broke out , and everybody about the palace was very busy polishing up armour and sharpening swords . for the king and his sons were to ride at the head of the army . then [male] left his geese , and came and told the king that he wished to go to fight also . the king gave him leave , and told him that he might go to the stable and take any horse he liked from the stables . so [male] examined the horses carefully , but instead of picking out one of the splendid well groomed creatures .
most of those who lined the street could have had no close relations with the dead girl . but yonder black robed mourners who followed the bier were her parents . her brothers and sisters , her nearest relatives . the members of the council , and the family servants . and she , the wretched , reckless , sinful , crippled strolling player , for whom not a soul on earth cared .
iduna , the goddess , tended the tree on which the shining apples grew . none would grow on the tree unless she was there to tend it . no one but [female] might pluck the shining apples . each morning she plucked them and left them in her basket and every day the gods and goddesses came to her garden that they might eat the shining apples and so stay for ever young . [male] , the father of the gods .
and he caught the bridle of her horse and away they went . and for the moment she forgot all about the knight . for from behind came the sound of crashing branches . and she knew that the magi were following them . but the old hunter ran in front of the horse .
during the conversation the rabbit mentioned that he was going fishing . and described how pleasant fishing was when the weather was fine and the sea smooth . then he went home and built two boats . one of wood and the other of clay , at last they were both finished . and as the rabbit stood and looked at his work he felt that all his trouble would be well rewarded if his plan succeeded .
as may be imagined , when [female] came home she had not only one . but many stories to tell ; and they are written in this book . she was sitting on the branches of a tree . which were so bent that they formed a sort of hammocky rocking chair . the tree was close to the bank of the river .
the present brood were now full grown , and were waiting for daylight to fly through the woods and mountains . when lo , just at midnight the water of the well made a splashing noise . and what appeared in the moonlight that flickered through the trees ? two fiery heads . which approached the nest , setting up such a howling and wailing that the mountains shook to their foundations and the valleys rocked to and fro like cradles . suddenly , in the twinkling of an eye , the joints of the earth and sky trembled and quaked .
for weeks the monkey and the shark breakfasted together . and it was a wonder that the tree had any fruit left for them . they became fast friends , and told each other about their homes and their children . and how to teach them all they ought to know , by and bye the monkey became rather discontented with his green house in a grove of palms beyond the town . and longed to see the strange things under the sea which he had heard of from the shark .
feeling himself wounded unto death the knight fled . and [male] pursued him till they came to a splendid castle . here the knight dashed across the bridge that spanned the moat . and entered the gate , but as soon as he was safe inside , the drawbridge was pulled up and caught [male] 's horse in the middle . so that half of him was inside and half out .
the boy knew that he was riding above a large city . for he saw spires and house roofs rising from the clouds in every direction . sometimes an opening was made in the circling mists . and he looked down into a running , tortuous stream . but no land could he see , all this was beautiful to look upon , but he felt quite distraught .
there was once upon a time a little village girl . the prettiest ever seen or known , of whom her mother was dotingly fond , her grandmother was even fonder of her still . and had a little red [female] made for the child , which suited her so well . that wherever she went , she was known by the name of little red riding hood . one day , her mother having baked some cakes .
syed [female] understood what the [male] demanded of him . the relation was painful to him , he changed colour several times . and could not help shewing how greatly he was embarrassed , however , he must resolve to tell his story . but before he spoke , he prostrated himself before the [male] 's throne . and after he rose up , endeavoured to speak to satisfy the [male] , but was so confounded .
there is no question as to the suddenness of the stroke of fate that ended [female] 's career in [location] . there is an open question as to the illuminative force of that blow . and we must wait for the answer , how glad i was to get off ! my good byes were hurried when once the brown envelope had come , i saw him on the hospital stoep ( baraza , did they call it in that alien part of [location] ? ) just as i was rushing down to the station , he had lost his blue color .
branduv called [female] out of the sea . and he asked that he renew the promise he had made to his father . the lord of the sea did not want a promise to lapse because of the death of a man . and he renewed it to the man 's son . then [male] told him he would take him and show him the kingdoms of the sea and whatever he saw that he desired there would be given to him .
emile , [female] , and [female] exchanged glances full of meaning . trying to guess what it could be that was found ever where and that they did not yet know of . they were a hundred leagues from guessing what their uncle meant . [male] took from his desk a stick of sealing wax and rubbed it rapidly over his cloth sleeve . then he put it near a small piece of paper .
`` what do you say ? what do you say ? '' said the king . dancing along , back and forth , the king held out his left hand as he passed . and i trotted along beside him , and drawing from my pouch one of my little jars . i applied to the king 's palm , with my fingers . a small portion of my salve , rubbing it in as well as i could .
thus the night passed , the moon went down ; the stars grew pale . the cold day broke ; the sun rose , the carrier still sat . musing , in the chimney corner , he had sat there . with his head upon his hands , all night . all night the faithful cricket had been chirp .
about this particular evening , however , there was something exceptional , it was one of those rare atmospheres in which a smoked glass slide seems to have been slid away from between [location] and nature . so that even dark colours on that day look more gorgeous than bright colours on cloudier days . the trampled earth of the river banks and the peaty stain in the pools did not look drab but glowing umber . and the dark woods astir in the breeze did not look . as usual , dim blue with mere depth of distance .
dr. [female] says the wood is that of a rather soft wooded dicotyledonous tree . the chirima boring instrument figured by mr. [male] ( annual report for june 30 . 1906 ) is rather of the mafulu type , but in this case the fly wheel . instead of being a flat piece of wood , appears to be made of a split reed bound on either side of the upright cane shaft . hammocks are also used in the plains and on the coast .
his ears covered the whole sides of his head . his jaws were as large around as a bushel basket . at first , after he had entered the room , he did not perceive either father time or the masked lady . he dropped one end of his bludgeon to the floor with a thump . and there he stood leering at everychild with a sinister and triumphant expression .
the third sunday the little girl appeared in a diamond dress . at the dance , again , she was the soul of the evening . but this time the young men wanted her to stay to the end of the ball . and watched her very closely , so that she might not escape , when , therefore , she tried to get away . she was in such a hurry that she had no time to pick up a shoe she accidentally dropped in the corridor .
when the princess saw that the lord of her life was beside her . she was torn between love and wonder and modesty . and did not know what she ought to do , so they were secretly married and lived there in supreme happiness . master mind lived in a double form , by day he was a girl with the pill in his mouth . by night a man without the pill .
it was some time before [male] could take his eyes from the marvel of her loveliness . fearing at last that he was rude , he turned them away . and , behold , he was in a room that was for beauty [male] ! the lofty ceiling was all a golden vine , whose great clusters of carbuncles . rubies , and chrysoberyls hung down like the bosses of groined arches .
when they saw the dog swimming across with the cat on his back . it seemed to them the funniest thing they had ever seen in all their lives . the dog was so busy swimming that he did not even notice them . but the cat , upon his back , saw everything that was going on . she herself suddenly began to think what a funny thing it was that she should be riding at ease on the dog 's back .
`` most certainly i will , if that 's all you want , '' replied the [female] . and gave the girl his hand , the bird screamed . `` swan , hold fast , '' said [male] , and the black man was added to their number . they soon came to a village where a fair was being held . a travelling circus was giving a performance , and the clown was just doing his tricks .
his arms flapped like windmills , and the uncouth scholar counted himself the happiest man on earth as he began to arrange the great volumes on the shelves . not that he got on very quickly , for he wrote out the catalogue in his best running hand . he put the books on the shelves as carefully as if they had been old and precious [location] . yet in spite of the [male] 's zeal . his labours advanced but slowly , often he would chance to open a volume when halfway up the [male] .
[female] , the toy merchant . was well known in the neighborhood , many people called him [male] and [male] . the name of the firm when [male] was [male] 's partner . although [male] had bought out [male] 's interest years before . the name still remained , it was odd that such a man should have been a toy maker .
the next thing he did was to summon all the gold beaters in the kingdom . which he did easily enough with the king 's letter . for directly they saw the words `` i will cut off your head if you do not ! '' and the king 's signature beneath . they came running as fast as their legs could carry them .
if one of the board was seen passing , we hid behind everything and . as we were never clear just who belonged to the board , we hid when nearly all grown folk passed . that the building and grounds were ours . paid for by our father 's taxes , and that the school officials and even the tyrannical janitor were town servants to help [location] to make good use of our own . no more occurred to [location] than it occurred to [location] to find a ring in the ground .
he could handle a spear too , and his thrusts went straight at the mark . while he could sing a song , or touch the lute as delicately as a [male] . his father was proud of him , and it went sore with him when [male] the emperor . who had had a bitter quarrel with the king of denmark . demanded that [male] should be sent as a hostage to his court of [location] .
`` then tomorrow we shall ride thither , '' said the princess . next morning accordingly they set out together , and when they had come to the place . the princess drew forth a small bottle that she had brought with her . and sprinkled the body with some drops of the water so that immediately he became alive again . when he stood up , his brother said to him .
joy reigned through the whole house , as well as in the [female] 's nest . although there the chief cause was really the good food . especially the quantities of frogs , which seemed to spring out of the ground in swarms . then the learned men hastened to note down , in flying characters , the story of the two princesses . and spoke of the arrival of the health giving flower as a mighty event .
the next day [male] the hen wife 's son stood outside the cook house and he heard a tremendous rattling within . `` that is the cook 's son preparing to go out to battle , '' said one of the grooms , `` he is striking the ladles upon the pot lids to show how fierce he is . '' just as that was being said the cook 's son walked out of the cook house . he looked around him very haughtily , then he walked away with his big sword trailing behind him and his breast plate all to one side .
modesty will not allow , nor is it necessary to relate , what passed betwixt the blacks and ladies . it is sufficient to say , that [male] saw enough to convince him that his brother had as much cause to complain as himself . this amorous company continued together till midnight and having bathed all together in a great pond . which was one of the chief ornaments of the garden , they dressed themselves . and re entered the palace , by the secret door , all except [male] .
the delighted girl immediately did as she was directed , and the two heads were united to the bodies . so that she once again saw her husband and father alive , but no sooner did they begin to speak than she found that she had made a terrible mistake . for , in her eagerness to restore the heads to their bodies again . she had not noticed that she had united her husband 's head to his father 's body . and [female] 's head to her husband 's body .
and so it lay quite quiet , while the shots rattled through the reeds and gun after gun was fired . at last , late in the day , silence was restored ; but the poor duckling did not dare to rise up . it waited several hours before it looked around . and then hastened away out of the moor as fast as it could , it ran on over field and meadow . there was such a storm raging that it was difficult to get from one place to another .
[male] heard the cheers , but scarcely heeded them . for his heart went out through his eyes that were fastened on the princess . and a wild hope stirred him that his glance was not ungrateful to the loveliest lady of the land . and the princess was sad and sorry for her vow . for she believed that it was beyond the power of [female] to bring her a robe of all the colours of the rainbow .
`` nay , '' said death , pointing to the medals on the dead man 's breast . i taught him whilst he was doing his duty . i can not teach you , and so saying he vanished from her sight . she went out from the church down to the sea shore . there was a high sea , and a great wind , a little child had been playing on a row of rocks .
once upon a time there was a poor woman who had an only daughter . named [female] , a very lazy girl , one day when she had refused to do a single thing . her mother took her down to the banks of a stream and began to strike her fingers with a flat stone . just as you do in beating linen to wash it . the girl cried a good deal , a prince .
those who did not see grew more and more furious , crazy people , they cried , loons , silly babblers ! will you teach us ? then some began to beat [female] . others to belabor young [female] , at which [female] ran to her rescue . and being as brave as he was good , laid about him with his fists . and cried shame on you , to hurt a woman .
`` you can not bind me , '' shouted [male] . rushing upon him and striking with his hammer , but the river giant was so slimy that the blow slid harmlessly off his green chest . and as [male] stumbled and tried to regain his balance , the giant swung one of his long hairs around him and tripped him up . for a moment [male] was [male] . but remembering the power of the flame spirit which had entered into him .
this was enough to make the [male] reflect , he plainly perceived . that if what he had heard was true , his favourite must be innocent , and that he had been too hasty in giving such orders against [male] and his family . being resolved to be rightly informed in an affair which so nearly concerned him in point of equity . on which he valued himself , he immediately returned to his apartment . and that moment ordered [male] to repair to the dark tower .
in an edict of [male] , mention is also made of the muscatel . [male] , and the wine of lieppe . generally , the malmsey which was drunk in [male] was an artificial preparation . which had neither the colour nor taste of the cyprian wine . olivier de serres tells [location] that in his time it was made with water .
on the following morning , when the viceroy called his daughter for the last stage of their journey . he greeted fox sprite without suspecting that anything unusual had happened since he had last seen [male] . so well did this crafty spirit perform his part that the father was completely deceived . by look , by voice , and by gesture . the next day the travellers arrived at the capital and [male] presented himself before [male] .
they were charmed with these verses , and the overseer invited them to his house . but they declined and resumed to their own lodging , to rest from the great heat of the bath . they took their ease there and ate and drank and passed the night in the greatest comfort and delight . till morning , when they arose from sleep and making their ablutions . prayed the morning prayer and drank the morning draught , as soon as the sun had risen and the markets and shops were open .
they traversed the forest in all directions , and visited every cave . and rock , and mountain , for at least three miles round the palace . but they could not find a trace of either the robbers or the prince and princess . the king , however , could not rest , and caused further search and enquiries to be made . for weeks and months ; and he sent messengers into all the countries he could think of .
the windows were very high up ; the glass was red , blue , and green . and the sunlight shone through quite wondrously in all sorts of colors . on the table stood the most exquisite cherries , and [female] ate as many as she chose . for she had permission to do so , while she was eating . the old woman combed her hair with a golden comb .
immediately on the accession of [male] , in 1314 , a reaction commenced . the higher clergy re entered parliament ; but [male] long took care that the laity should be in a majority . and did not allow that in his council of state the titled councillors should be more numerous than the lawyers . the latter succeeded in completely carrying the day on account of the services they rendered . and the influence which their knowledge of the laws of the country gave them .
the hands are strong and short , the waist line is firm and smaller than the shoulders or hips . the buttocks usually appear heavy , his legs are generally straight ; the thighs and calves are those of a prime pedestrian accustomed to long and frequent walks . the ankles are seldom thick ; and the feet are broad and relatively short . and , almost without exception , are placed on the ground straight ahead , he has the feet of a pedestrian . not the inturned feet of the constant bearer of heavy burdens on the back or the outturned feet of the man who sits or stands .
after travelling for a long time , he descried a tent of fine gauze . fastened to a cedar tree by silver cords . with knobs of emeralds ; upon the tent was represented a silver kingdom . and on the top was a silver ball , at the entrance lay two immense tigers . to which he in like manner gave to drink , and they permitted him to pass .
now convinced that the goblin bird would return no more , [male] , full of pride and hardiness . returned to his father 's dwelling , on his arrival there . he was surrounded by all the villagers , who , full of curiosity . gathered around him , in admiration of the rich flock . and praised his good fortune , but the first impulse of their curiosity satiated .
king [male] mounted a stone table one end of which was laden with flagons . candelabra , tankards , and cups of gold of [male] workmanship . he signed to honey bee and to [male] to approach , at these words the dwarfs burst into a mighty shout . but not knowing if they ought to grieve or to rejoice , they were torn by conflicting emotions . with an expression sublime in its tenderness .
and in a voyage to portugal two of his sons did die . and to conclude , himself was brought to want and [male] : he pawned and mortgaged all his land ere seven years came about . and now at last this wicked act did by this means come out , the fellow that did take in hand these children for to kill . was for a robbery judged to die , such was god 's blessed will . who did confess the very truth , as here hath been displayed : the uncle having died in jail .
merrymineral tried hard to stop it , but he might as well have tried to stop a mad bull . as he could not stop , and the owl was catching him up . he turned in his saddle and hurled his heavy battle axe at the owl . but the owl caught it as it flew . and flung it back with such good aim and force that it hit the dragon on the back and cut it clean in half .
once upon a time there was a [male] little elf named dumps . who lived all by himself in a dark little house down in a valley . ever since he could remember , things had gone wrong with him . he shivered in the cold and kicked the coal bucket when the fire would not burn . he howled when he stumbled over his own dinner pots that he had left in the middle of the floor .
the mark of a great sin can not be erased , miss [female] was kind enough to put into english verse for me the following ballad . in some districts of armenia this tragic story of [female] and [female] is told as a prose tale as are the other tales of this volume . in some other districts , especially near the foot of mount [female] . it has the form of a versified ballad and is sung with great relish by both the armenians and the kurds . according to the tradition of the natives , [female] was an armenian youth and [female] a kurdish [female] .
and when the fish had returned the same answer that the others had made before them . without more ado the negro overturned the pan upon the fire and departed as he had come . when the sultan 's eyes had seen that marvel . he said to his vizier , here is mystery set before us ! surely these fish that talk have a past and a history .
now , if thessaly is the country of magic , it is also the country of robbers . and [male] soon noticed that everybody he met was in fear of them . indeed , they made this fear the excuse for all sorts of mean and foolish ways . for instance , [male] , who loved money and could not bear to spend a farthing . refused to have any seats in his house that could be removed , and in consequence there was nothing to sit upon except two marble chairs fixed to the wall .
his wife , as he came up the steps . had been taking another long , earnest , almost awe stricken gaze at the little white stranger . she hardly knew whether it was a dream or not . but she could not help fancying that she saw the delicate print of violet 's fingers on the child 's neck . it looked just as if , while violet was shaping out the image .
the tree certainly came forward well ; but everything else belonging to the castle went very rapidly back . what with feasting and gambling -- for these two things are like wheels . upon which no man can stand securely , six years had not passed away before the noble lord passed out of the castle gate . a beggared man , and the mansion was bought by a rich dealer . and this purchaser was the very man who had once been made a jest of there .
fatigued with his journey and with the excitement of his return . [male] lay down to rest , while he slept his mother came in and kissed him on both cheeks . instantly [male] 's curse was fulfilled and all memory of [male] left him . poor [male] waited for his return but he never came . then she knew what must have happened , heartbroken and lonely she found a spot near a farmhouse that commanded a view of the castle .
what happened ? the little sausage went out towards the wood , the little bird lighted the fire . the mouse stayed by the pot and waited alone until little sausage came home and brought wood for next day . but the little sausage stayed so long on the road that they both feared something was amiss . and the bird flew out a little way in the air to meet it . not far off , however , it met a dog on the road who had fallen on the poor sausage as lawful booty .
the dwarf , however , was really quite irresistible , and even at the spanish court . always noted for its cultivated passion for the horrible , so fantastic a little monster had never been seen . it was his first appearance , too , he had been discovered only the day before . running wild through the forest , by two of the nobles who happened to have been hunting in a remote part of the great cork wood that surrounded the town . and had been carried off by them to the palace as a surprise for the infanta .
or they left bavaria , swift [female] sought out the bishop . what greeting he sent to his friends by the rhine i know not . but he gave his red gold to the envoys out of love . and let them ride on , [male] said , right gladly would i see my sister 's sons here . seldom , alack , can i win to them at the rhine .
startled creatures hurried out of their path , and the very landscape appeared insignificant in their presence . monarchs of all they surveyed , this at last was splendid freedom . at a river , sparkling like glass in the burning sun . they stopped and slaked their thirst , lapping up the water greedily . then they turned again into the tangle of vegetation and laid themselves down to rest .
the wise men of the village were called together to hold an inquest . after summoning witnesses , and cross examining them and studying the strange creature . their verdict was that it could be nothing less than a hersen schim . that is , a spectre of the brain , they meant by this that there was no such animal . in years long gone , too many for the almanac to tell of , or for clocks and watches to measure .
so his wife gave him the sheath knife . and by and by the bird became very quiet , so that they almost hoped he was dead from old age . but one night , at the dead of night . into the birds wings came the longing to be once more in lands oversea . he stretched out his wings , and the man woke with a loud cry .
well , he put it into all the papers to find out who saved his daughter . and who had the dragon 's tongue and the princess 's diamond ring . and was without his forefinger , whoever could show these signs should marry his daughter and have his kingdom after his death . well , any number of gentlemen came from all parts of england . with forefingers cut off , and with diamond rings and all kinds of tongues , wild beasts
the man who had buried the treasure , conscious of his fault . fancied directly that these words bore reference to him . and that the secret had been betrayed , this was quite natural ; for whoever has a bad conscience . always interprets the most indifferent words as an allusion to himself . the second man then stumbled over [male] , likewise wishing him .
now think : out of that cauldron , where all the bubbles would be as big as the alps if it could get room for its boiling . certain bubbles have bubbled out and escaped -- up and away , and there they stand in the cool . cold sky -- mountains , think of the change . and you will no more wonder that there should be something awful about the very look of a mountain . from the darkness -- for where the light has nothing to shine upon .
the wax doll upon the easter wand seemed to become taller and stouter . and whirled itself round above the paper flowers on the wand . and exclaimed , quite loud , is that the nonsense to stuff a child 's mind with ! it is stupid fancy , -- and the wax doll was precisely like the cross old chancellor with the broad hat . and looked just as yellow and ill tempered as he did ; but the paper flowers knocked him on the thin legs .
and there the good whales lay , the happy sleepy beasts . upon the still oily sea , they were all right whales . you must know , and finners , and razor backs . and bottle noses , and spotted sea unicorns with long ivory horns . but the sperm whales are such raging , ramping , roaring , rumbustious fellows .
at this particular time our sloop was becalmed , and not far from the shore . the bank of the river , covered with mammoth trees . rose up several hundred feet in beautiful fashion , we seemed to be on the edge of some primeval forest that doubtless stretched far inland . finally , the leader motioned as if to ask whether we were willing to leave our craft to go on board their ship . `` what say you , my son ? '' asked my father .
altogether he was a very interesting beast , and his master was fond of him no end . and with the exception of compelling mr. [male] to remove to the centre of the state to avoid double taxation upon him . he was not wholly unprofitable ; for he was the best sheep dog in the country . he always kept the flock well together by the simple device of surrounding them . having done so , he would lie down , and eat , and eat .
in the reign of the [female] alraschid . there was at bagdad a druggist , called [male] thaher . a very rich and handsome man , he had more wit and politeness than those of his profession generally have . his integrity , sincerity , and jovial humour . made him to be loved and sought after by all sorts of people .
the market for sheep passes off like the other two ; and away they go . by their allotted road to [location] , my way being the railway . i make the best of it at twenty miles an hour . whirling through the now high lighted landscape ; thinking that the inexperienced green buds will be wishing . before long , they had not been tempted to come out so soon ; and wondering who lives in this or that château .
and now nothing was visible but the wings ; the fairy had changed into a moth . with large brown wings freckled with dark eyes , and it stood [person] upon the table . till at length , when the children had watched it some time . it fluttered toward the window and beat against the panes . as if it wished to be released , so they opened the casement and let it out in the wind and cold .
the queen was not to be jested with , she knew that a power as great as her own must have assisted them . and her rage increased to such a pitch , that without hesitating an instant . she determined on effecting their ruin by a final and most cruel trial . [female] was condemned to go on the morrow to the fair of time . to fetch the rouge of youth , and [female] than a fairy to proceed to the wood of wonders .
but as he came to the foot of the hill . there , sitting right in his way , was a beautiful fairy holding out towards him a crystal cup . over the rim of which flowed water as clear as crystal . unable to resist the temptation , the prince seized the cold . bright goblet , and drank the water , when he did so his thirst vanished .
the prince ran with him , and when they came on tip toe to the chink in the wall . he looked and saw his dear princess , then so great was his joy that he could not be restrained . he went and knocked at the door , resolving to see his princess at once . [female] , thinking it was the old woman . opened the door , and the prince immediately dashed into the room and threw himself at the feet of the princess .
so first they made their way to folkvang , [organization] , where [female] dwelt . the loveliest of all in [female] , she was [female] than fair . and sweeter than sweet , and the tears from her flower eyes made the dew which blessed the earth flowers night and morning . of her [female] borrowed the magic dress of feathers in which [female] was wont to clothe herself and flit like a great beautiful bird all about the world . she was willing enough to lend it to [male] when he told her that by its aid he hoped to win back the hammer which he had lost .
the little boy could remember what beautiful things he had seen there . but to night everything shone in its brightest colors . here stood the figure of a beautiful woman , as beautifully sculptured as possible by one of the great masters . her graceful limbs appeared to move ; dolphins sprang at her feet . and immortality shone from her eyes .
potent monarch , to whom i am so much indebted , replies the king , you think then that you are very near your capital . yes , says the sultan , i know it . it is not above four or five hours journey . it will take you a whole years journey . says the prince ; i do believe , indeed , that you came hither from your capital in the time you spoke of .
but what increased the gruesomeness tenfold , was that , from constant domestic , or indeed rather family association with the goblins . their countenances had grown in grotesque resemblance to the human , no one understands animals who does not see that every one of them . even amongst the fishes , it may be with a dimness and vagueness infinitely remote . yet shadows the human : in the case of these the human resemblance had greatly increased . while their owners had sunk toward them , they hod risen toward their owners .
then [male] knew that he had been hopelessly beaten , and the prince and princess continued their journey without any more adventures . how much a fool that 's sent to roam excels a fool that stays at home . [female] , for this was the youth 's name . mounted a horse , and set out for [male] , hoping to find a ship there that would take him to [male] . after he had ridden for some time he saw a man standing at the foot of a poplar tree .
the last scene of all makes one long to have a play based upon this story . who would not be proud to act king [male] and have such a lofty mind ? it would be difficult , of course , to get together such a wedding present as he gave [male] . but the players could easily agree to play the game of `` let 's pretend , '' as [male] did when he hung up a card .
when the man was safe in the bathroom she told her daughters to make a sack exactly like his . as quickly as possible , then she changed the two sacks , and hid the man 's sack away . the man enjoyed his bath , slept soundly , and set off early next morning . taking what he believed to be the sack the crane had given him . all the way home he felt in such good spirits that he sang and whistled as he walked through the wood .
there is another world under this earth , it is like this one in every way . the animals , the plants , and the people are the same . but the seasons are different , the streams that come down from the mountains are the trails by which we reach this underworld . the springs at their head are the doorways by which we enter it . but in order to enter the other world , one must fast and then go to the water .
but the stranger went on to the village and told all he met that he had seen an old woman who lived in a shoe . and soon people came from all parts of the country to look at the [female] house . and they usually went away laughing , the old woman did not mind this at all . she was too busy to be angry , some of the children were always getting bumped heads or bruised shins . or falling down and hurting themselves , and these had to be comforted , and some were naughty and had to be whipped .
then the monk cried : brother , leave your hut . i will bring the dear girl back to life . and while they eagerly questioned him , he opened the book . and read the magic spell , and sprinkled holy water on the ashes . and [female] immediately stood up , alive , and the girl was more beautiful than ever .
and one of them arose ; and as he came upon the road to meet her she passed by . and he followed as fast as he could , being on foot . and the greater was his speed , the farther was she from him . and when he saw that it profited him nothing to follow her . he returned to [male] , and said unto him .
at the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of black velvet . powdered with suns and stars , the king 's favourite devices . and broidered on the colour he loved best , perhaps she was hiding behind that ? he would try at any rate , he ran across the soft moorish carpets . and opened the door , no , she was not here either , the room was quite empty .
so when the giants had gone he swept and tidied the camp and put some venison on the fire to roast . at midday , when the sun was right overhead . he heard a rumbling noise from the river . and looking up he saw the head and shoulders of an enormous man emerging from it , and behold ! right down the river bed and up the river bed , till they faded into the blue distance .
the boy sat on a small oriental rug , and by his side stood a very peculiar lamp . the boy was clad in a purple garment made of silk . with slippers to match , he wore a very fine skull cap . also of silk , and a pig tail hung down his back . his eyes were very peculiar , they were placed in his head a little on end .
when she saw her own face she was quite frightened . it was so brown and ugly ; but when she wet her little hand and rubbed her eyes and forehead her white skin shone through again . then she took off all her clothes and went into the fresh water . a more beautiful royal child than she could not be found in all the world . it was a very dark night , not a single glow worm sparkled in the marsh .
within the past year , owing to the extensions of the great eastern railway premises at bishopsgate street . an old house of antiquarian interest was pulled down , and generously presented by the company to the south kensington museum . it will shortly be arranged so as to enable the visitor to see a good example of the exterior as well as some of the interior woodwork of a quaint house of the middle of the seventeenth century . this was the residence of sir [male] . diplomatist , during the time of [male] .
sir [male] knew the outrageous injustice of this remark as well as you or i do . and so did the portrait of his ancestor , which he happened to be passing under . for the red nose in the tapestry turned a deeper [male] in scornful anger . but , luckily for the nerves of its descendant , the moths had eaten its mouth away so entirely . that the retort it attempted to make sounded only like a faint hiss .
the prince promised to inquire , and went on his way , he wandered about for three days more . and at the end of the third day saw a little town . it was quite late when he reached it . but he could discover no light anywhere , and walked almost right through it without finding a house where he could turn in . but far away at the end of the town he saw a light in a window .
after speaking of several works by miss mcmanus . a notice from [location] says : a more difficult or at least a more intricate series were the designs cut on wood for the altar service book , just issued in [location] by that newly founded venture , the de la more press . which has drawn unto itself such scholars as dr. [female] . professor [female] , and [female] .
she returned to her own country in due time . found all her old acquaintances and friends slaughtered or trampled upon , and scourged by the blood thirsty and cruel cummings . all the ancient possessions of the shaws ruled by and , apparently , in the everlasting possession of the inveterate enemies of her kith and kin . years and days passed away , and those days and years added growth and vigour to the young heir . who , until he attained to years of discretion .
waupee , or the white hawk , lived in a remote part of the forest . where animals abounded , every day he returned from the chase with a large spoil . for he was one of the most skillful and lucky hunters of his tribe . his form was like the cedar ; the fire of youth beamed from his eye . there was no forest too gloomy for him to penetrate , and no track made by bird or beast of any kind which he could not readily follow .
`` i wonder , '' said he , `` if the little grey [male] can help me now. '' so he whistled on his fingers , just as it had told him . then who should come hopping and skipping along but the little grey [male] itself . `` what do you want , [male] ? '' it said . after that he slept like a flat stone , for one can sleep well even in the straw .
`` they are very hard conditions , '' said the devil . but there was no other way out of it -- if the devil wanted to be set free . he would have to promise it , he bargained . however , that he should have the first soul that went across the bridge . that was to be the toll , yes , he should have that , said the youngster .
the genie then showed him the treasury . which was opened by a treasurer , where [male] ad deen saw heaps of purses . of different sizes , piled up to the top of the ceiling . and disposed in most excellent order , the genie assured him of the treasurer 's fidelity . and thence led him to the stables .
prince [male] was now called on to speak , he admitted that the reward was offered for bringing the horns and tail . not for killing the monster , but were the king 's intentions to go for nothing ? when a subject only meant well , of course he had to suffer . but when a king said one thing , was he not to be supposed to have meant another ? any fellow with a waggon could bring the horns and tail .
while they were on the road the serpent stopped at a spring and said to the youth . `` wait while i bathe in this water , and whatever may happen , fear not ! '' with that the serpent plunged into the water , and immediately there arose such a terrible storm . such a tempest , such a hurricane , with lightning flash upon lightning flash , and thunder bolt upon thunder bolt . that the day of judgment could not well be worse , presently the serpent came out of the bath .
`` this is to remind you of me , '' said [male] . `` when you have gone home again , '' and as he spoke he hung it around the princess 's neck . hardly had the last stroke sounded when every light was snuffed out , and all was instantly dark and still . then , before she had time to think , the genie of good luck snatched the princess up once more and flew back to the palace more swiftly than the wind . and , before the princess knew what had happened to her , there she was .
leaving the [female] of the house and her daughter in law alone . presently , the two began to talk and the elder woman said `` well what with the pigs and the goats that have been sacrificed during this sohrai we have had plenty of meat to eat lately and yet i do not feel as if i had had any . '' that is so , answered her daughter in law ; fowls and pig 's flesh is very unsatisfying . `` then what are we to do ? '' rejoined the old woman , `` i do not know unless you do for the father of your grandchild . '' when he heard this [male] shivered with fright and hid himself further under the rice shelf .
said he , ` it 's not in the least good of me . i could not be comfortable otherwise , after this he said nothing for a while . and i laid myself on the floor of his garret . and stared up and around at the great blue beautifulness , i had forgotten him almost . when at last he said : ` ai not you done yet ? ` done what ? ', i asked .
so he was frightened , and went ; but he was quite dazed , he shivered and shook . and his knees trembled , so there he stood gazing at her . and it was like looking at a shining sun , she looked at him so wildly that it caused a shudder to run through him . did you ever hear the story of the three poor soldiers who . after having fought hard in the wars , set out on their road home .
i went home very melancholy at the loss of my money , i was obliged to buy a new turban . which diminished the small remainder of the ten pieces ; for i had laid out several in hemp . the little that was left was not sufficient to give me reason to indulge the great hopes i had conceived . but what troubled me most , was the little satisfaction i should be able to give my benefactor for his ineffectual generosity . when he should come to hear what a misfortune i had met with .
but it is now time to return to the fate of the third baby . this time a princess , like its brothers . it was found by the intendant of the gardens . and adopted by him and his wife , and all three were brought up with the greatest care and tenderness . as the children grew older their beauty and air of distinction became more and more marked .
but [female] did not appear at his house that night . in surly mood , and without a shilling in his pocket . he was making his way homeward . his bottle of [male] , his last investment . half emptied , with its neck protruding .
the outlaw leader had pity on their distress . and gave them food ; and as they ate ravenously the outlaws whispered one to another . `` this is [male] , '' `` this is [male] , '' understanding all the evils that had befallen him . their leader soon made [male] his second in command . and when after three weeks the outlaw king was pardoned and allowed to return home .
when the two brothers got to the glass hill all the princes and knights were trying to ride up it . and their horses were in a foam ; but it was all in vain . for no sooner did the horses set foot upon the hill than down they slipped . and there was not one which could get even so much as a couple of yards up . nor was that strange , for the hill was as smooth as glass windowpanes and as steep as the side of a house .
`` oh , my true son , '' cried the king as he clasped the prince in his arms . whilst all the pachas and emirs shouted , `` long live prince [male] ! '' in the midst of all the noise and rejoicing [male] slipped off with his little box under his arm . he went to the stables , saddled his old horse . [male] , and rode out of the gate towards [location] .
the duke pretended to be unconcerned but in his heart he was deeply shaken . the voice of the astrologer sounded to him like the voice of judgment and for the first time conscience began to trouble him . as for the governors , they could not eat a bite of food and were carried from the palace half dead with fright . they piled their ill gotten wealth into wagons and rode away to their castles . where they barred all the doors and windows in order to keep the devil out .
and so it was done , and the heart of [female] rejoiced . for by this time she loved her husband dearly . when [male] saw that , he knew that [male] was indeed the son of [male] . his friend , and the rightful king of denmark . and , waking the sleeping man , he bade him sit up and receive his homage .
leander had travelled a journey long enough to give him a good appetite . which made him draw near the table , where the very smell of such viands was agreeable and refreshing . the princess had a curious tabby cat , for which she had a great kindness . this cat one of the maids of honour held in her arms . saying , `` madam , [female] is hungry , '' with that a chair was presently brought for the cat .
he found also meadows and lanes . islands and lakes , where the birds sang sweeter . and the flowers were more brilliant and fragrant than anything he had ever seen on earth . there was a breeze , and yet one did not feel the wind ; it was quite clear and bright . but there was no heat ; the waves were dashing , still there was no danger .
she cried , and her voice grew thin and chill like a piercing winter wind . her form grew vague as a snow wreath or a white vaporous cloud . for an instant it hung upon the air . then it rose slowly through the smoke hole in the ceiling and was no more seen . the wise poet sat reading by the light of his [male] .
to show that what he said was true , he unlocked the gate . and set the captives all free , then he led them to the great room . placed them round the table , and placed before them two quarters of beef . with bread and wine ; upon which they feasted their fill . when supper was over , they searched the giant 's coffers .
then the children said good by to the mermaid . and the rocks opened for them and they passed through . and soon they found themselves in a meadow starred with flowers . and through the meadow sped a sunlit stream , they followed the stream until it led them into a garden of roses . and beyond the garden , standing on a [person] hill .
`` no , you must not die , '' said [female] , as she kissed the flowers . then the door of the room opened , and a number of beautiful flowers danced in . [male] could not imagine where they could come from , unless they were the flowers from the king 's garden . first came two lovely roses , with little golden crowns on their heads . these were the king and queen , beautiful stocks and carnations followed .
the smith made a second lance , and that also flew up into the air and broke to pieces when it came down again . then the youth shook himself in the ashes a third time . and such a hurricane arose that there was scarce a ploughshare in the whole country-side that was not carried away . it was only with great difficulty that the smith could make the third lance . but when that came down on the youth 's finger it did not break in pieces like the others .
thanks to the enchanted necklace , [male] became a truthful child . long before the year had passed , [male] came for his necklace . he needed it for another child who told falsehoods . no one can tell today what has become of the wonderful necklace of truth . but if i were a little child in the habit of telling falsehoods .
the difficulties he met with -- huge rocks to be climbed . deep rivers to be crossed , and thorny tracts to be avoided -- only served to make his heart beat quicker . for he was really brave all through , and not merely when he could not help himself . like a great many people , but in spite of all his efforts he could not find his way out of the forest . and he began to think he should have to pass the night there .
at which [female] smiled , and because his great-grandfather was a cheshire cat . his smile gave him a wise and jovial look . as if the sphinx of [location] should suddenly see a joke . with a good heart he went daintily on his way . shaking the snow from his paws at times .
he tried the key , it fitted , it turned . a great clang and clash , as of iron bolts on huge brazen caldrons . echoed thunderously within , he drew out the key , the rock in front of him began to fall . he retreated from it as far as the breadth of the platform would allow . a great slab fell at his feet , in front was still the solid rock .
so the hornet is now an oriole , a bird that is loved by every one . his nest looks like that of a hornet because he learned how to build his home before he became an oriole . [female] , queen of the gods . had the fairest cow that any one ever saw , she was creamy white . and her eyes were of as soft and bright a blue as those of any [male] in the world .
when the [male] awoke the next morning , the prince as well as the castle had disappeared . she lay in a green opening in the midst of a thick . dark wood , and beside her lay the bundle of poor belongings she had brought from home . and when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes . and had cried her fill , she set out and wandered many , many days .
the door was just a wee crack open , as she peeped in . [female] saw that there was a light in the room . and the sight which met her eyes almost made her cry out . on the floor stood [female] in her very best frock . and mr. [male] was asking her to dance with him , [male] was at work on the big drum .
the gazelle kept silence for a few moments . then it said , the elders said , one that does good like a mother , and i have done him good , and i have got this that the elders said . but go up again to the master , and tell him the gazelle is very ill . and it has not drunk the gruel of red [male] .
so he set off , and hunted and hunted up and down for the shoe . but no shoe did he find ; and at length he had to go back with the one he had . but , meanwhile the youth had taken the ox and gone off with it . and when the man came and saw his ox gone , he began to cry and bewail . for he was afraid his old [male] would kill him outright when she came to know that the ox was lost .
on and on went the buffalo , until at last , in the deepest and darkest part of the forest . he paused and allowed [male] to slip from his back . this was the spot where he and his followers had their camp . and it was here he intended to keep [female] until she consented to become his wife . he spoke to her in the softest voice he could manage .
the father looked less bent and weary and his eyes were clear and good , as if at last he had found the answer to that which had troubled him so long . [male] , the goose girl , did not glance longingly about , for she had found some one to care for her . and now she could be a child again , the boy sat on the [male] 's back and rode up amongst the clouds . some thirty geese , in regular order , flew rapidly southward , there was a rustling of feathers and the many wings beat the air so noisily that one could scarcely hear one 's own voice . [female] from kebnekaise flew in the lead .
all the wolves and hyenas , fast asleep in the wood . heard her voice , and shivered in their dreams . no wonder then that the princess trembled , and found herself compelled . she could not understand how , to obey the summons , she rose . like the guilty thing she felt , forsook of herself the hiding place she had chosen .
but he said `` no , '' his luck was gone , his sword was broken . and he must die , and he told her that she would have a son . and that son would be a great warrior , and would avenge him on the other king , his enemy . and he bade her keep the broken pieces of the sword . to make a new sword for his son , and that blade should be called [male] .
his name was [male] , you may see . plainly enough , that it was a very difficult business to fight with such a fellow . for , as often as he got a knock down blow , up he started again . stronger , fiercer , and abler to use his weapons than if his enemy had let him alone . thus , the harder [male] pounded the giant with his club .
out of the proceeds of his specially allotted lands the inca had to keep up the army . the roads throughout the whole empire , and all the machinery of government . this was conducted by a special governing class all more or less closely related to the inca himself . and representing a civilization and a culture much in advance of the great masses of the population . the remaining fourth -- the lands of the sun -- provided not only for the priests who conducted the public worship throughout the empire .
`` it repenteth me sorely , '' said sir [male] . and he was heavy in spirit thereafter , and was eager to get whole again and to go away . in four or five days he made a plot with sir [male] . that he should rise and clothe himself in his armour and get upon his horse . and in this way show to the hermit and to the maid [male] that indeed and in truth he was strong enough to ride forth .
a danish legend relates that a poor man , who was working near [location] . a haunted hill , lay down on it to rest himself in the middle of the day . suddenly there appeared before him a beautiful [male] . with a gold cup in her hand , she made signs to him to come near . but when the man in his fright made the sign of the cross .
they came out after a while from among the grasses . vines , and undergrowth , the [female] climbed heavily up a rocky slope . trudged on over an open and level space of snow , across an icy yet faintly stirring stream . and came at length to a low wooden house drifted deep in snow . in front of which a big fire was burning , showering up sparks into the starry sky .
some called themselves the band of [male] . and would fight all comers ; and among them was sir [male] . sir [male] of [male] , sir [male] . sir [male] the seneschal . sir [male] , sir [male] .
and the earth said so much , and the little girl 's heart so strongly beat mother . that she could not help going to see , and as she looked up , she saw the tops of the high buildings across the street . and below them the windows hung thick as pictures on a wall , and thicker . the shop doors were open like doors to wonderful . mysterious palaces where you went in with your mother and she picked out your dresses and said , `` wouldn ''
the dream fairies showed [female] how to get to the edge of the moon . and when she had crawled there she held on to the edge very fast and peeped over as cautiously as if she had been a timid little mouse instead of the bravest [female] in all the world . she was very cautious and quiet , because the dream fairies had told her that she must be very sure not to awaken any of the little babies . for there are no mothers up there on the other side of the moon . and if by any chance a little baby is awakened -- why , as you would easily suppose .
nillywill and hands pansy were the most unimportant and happy pair of lovers the world has ever gained or lost . with them it had been a case of love at first blindness since the day when they had tumbled into each other 's arms in the same cradle . and hands pansy , when he first saw her , did not discover that [female] was a real princess hiding her birthright in the home of a poor peasant . nor did [female] , when she first saw hands . see in him the baby beginnings of the most honest and good heart that ever sprang out of poverty and humble parentage .
transported with eagerness and delight , he dashed his sword through the crystal and succeeded in breaking a small opening . to which she put up her beautiful rosy mouth , but it was in vain . prince wish could not approach it . he twisted his neck about , and turned his head on all sides . till at length , putting up his hand to his face .
ivan remembered his dying father 's command . and took deeply to heart the evident warning of god that a fire should be extinguished in the beginning . if any one wronged him he did not seek revenge . but instead made every effort to settle the matter peaceably , if any one spoke to him unkindly . he did not answer in the same way , but replied softly , and tried to persuade the person not to speak evil .
in due time , he became a priest and a [male] and was even called to rome and was created a cardinal . he wore a red cap and cloak . people kneeled to him and sought his blessing . and all spoke of him as the wisest , kindliest and most scholarly man in the church . he had not spoken of his boyhood for years .
the king let him have all that he wanted . and then the little grey [male] took [male] and the three barrels of soft pitch and the bag of barley corn and the pot of good tallow on its back . and off it went till the wind whistled behind [male] 's ears . then up came a great river pike , and on his back he took [male] and the little grey [male] and the three barrels of pitch and the sack of barley corn and the pot of good tallow . and away he swam till he had brought them from this side to that .
some flower pieces by this artist are in the collection of the grand duke of [organization] . others belong to the hereditary grand duke and to the queen of saxony . still others are in various private galleries , a recently published design for the wall decoration of a school . `` fingerhut im walde , '' was awarded a prize , [female] ley receives young women students in her atelier in karlsruhe .
at last they struck a bargain , the genie swearing by [male] that he would make the fisherman rich . and then the fisherman cut the seal again , and the genie came out of the vase . the first thing he did when he got out was to kick the vase into the sea . which frightened the fisherman , who began to beg and pray for his life , but the genie kept his word . and took him past the city , over a mountain and over a vast plain .
then sadly she left him , he was alone on his tower and night was coming . he tried to think of his vow , but her eyes called him . her lips brushed his like the light wing of a nesting bird . hour after hour he endured the pain . and at last tears rolled from his eyes and melted his armor .
occasionally , however , there was one fairy , so wise , so learned , and so able to tell what was going to happen tomorrow . or next year , that the other fairies looked up to such an one with respect and awe . yet these honorables would hardly know what you were talking about , if you asked any of them how old they might be . or spoke of `` old '' or `` young , '' if , by any chance . a fairy did use the world `` old '' in talking of their number .
then for the last figure of all she drew out the dagger . [female] gratitude to [male] for thus preserving his life a second time . knew no bounds , he took her in his arms and embraced her as a daughter . now , said he , the time is come when i must fulfil my debt . and how better can i do it than by marrying you to my son ?
mr. [male] stood waiting for a minute . then he faintly heard [male] call `` now , '' it sounded like he had run way off in the woods . not sure what the game was , mr. [male] walked back to the bridge and started to cross it . just then there was the most awful noise he had ever heard , he stopped to look around . and [male] came running and screaming up from under the bridge , mr. [male] stood there for a moment with his mouth wide open .
the emperor , contrary to his usual custom , did not hunt long that day . presuming that the princes possessed wit equal to their courage and bravery . he longed with impatience to converse with them more at liberty . he made them ride on each side of him . an honour which , without speaking of the principal courtiers who accompanied him .
they loosened their moorings , and made for the middle of the stream . and when they were at some distance from the bank . the [male] took his oar , and struck such a heavy blow at the other boat . that it broke in two , the tanuki fell straight into the water . and was held there by the [male] till he was quite dead .
the commentary lay on the table and , to all appearances . it was not changed ; but there must have been something [male] about that too . for he could not manage to read a single word of it . without actually standing right in the book itself , he read a couple of lines . and then he chanced to look up , with that , his glance fell on the looking glass .
george looked in front of him . he certainly seemed to be seated on something like a broomstick . and right in front of him sat the yellow cat . flashing its red eyes into the darkness like searchlights . [female] was seated quite close to her , looking as pleased as punch , [male] looked behind him and heard the noise of an engine .
he was silent , and so were [male] and [male] . all three pale and cold like images of the dead . at length the fearful narrator added in a low voice , and as if he were quite exhausted . he has visited me since that time . but he will never again come through the little door , have i not established peace and order in my castle ?
and one of them ran faster than his mate , and outstripped him . and forced his way through the willows , and came out on the other side , and lo ! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow . so he hastened towards it . and stooping down placed his hands upon it , and it was a cloak of golden tissue .
meanwhile the queen [female] , in a peasant 's dress . with a straw hat on her head , and a canvas sack on her shoulder . began her journey : sometimes on horseback , sometimes on foot . sometimes by sea , sometimes by land , wandering ; evermore after her beloved king charming . one day , stopping beside a fountain , she let her hair fall loose .
he put on his spectacles , but could not see through them . taking them off and rubbing them he saw that the glass had become plates of gold . as he went down stairs , he put his hand on the railing . it turned to gold , he opened the door and went into the garden . the roses were nodding in the fresh morning breeze .
what changes it has undergone , and what work it has been doing during all the long ages that water has lain on the face of the earth ? it is a drop now , but it was not so before i lifted it out of the basin . then it was part of a sheet of water . and will be so again if i let it fall , again , if i were to put this basin on the stove till all the water had boiled away . where would my drop be then ? where would it go ? what forms will it take before it reappears in the rain cloud .
judas , however , suggested that the crosses should be carried to the midst of the city . and that they should pray for another miracle to reveal the truth . this was done at dawn , and the triumphant band of christians raised hymns of prayer and praise until the ninth hour . then came a mighty crowd bearing a young man lifeless on his bier . at [male] 's command they laid down the bier .
it appears most dangerous opposite to sigtuna , [location] 's old royal city . the lake is broad here ; the waves rise as if they were the waters of the ocean . the boats rock -- it is fearful to look at ! but here there must be a calm ; and sigtuna , that little interesting town where the old towers stand in ruins . like outposts along the rocks , reflects itself in the water .
but on the morrow , when the time grew near , the king 's daughter and this hero of arms went to give a meeting to the beast . and they reached the black rock , at the upper end of the loch . they were but a short time there when the beast stirred in the midst of the loch . but when the general saw this terror of a beast with three heads . he took fright , and he slunk away .
the fisherman cast anchor , and threw overboard his lines . suddenly his boat moved uneasily , and close to its side the oily surface of the pale sea broke into a tumbling mass of foam . in the heart of the troubled waters , the fisherman beheld . to his great astonishment , a man clad in a strange garment of gleaming black scales . struggling with an enormous scarlet fish , a battle of life and death they fought .
no , let me rather die , said the prince . for what signifies it whether i die here or elsewhere ? for die i know i must very shortly . it may be , this very minute that we are talking , [female] is no more ! and why should i endeavour to live after she is dead ? the jeweller at length prevailed on him to go . but they had not gone far before they came to a mosque .
but the young king had witnessed everything , and not knowing why the faithful [male] had done this was very angry . and called out , `` throw him into prison , '' the next morning the [male] was brought up for trial . and led to the gallows ; and as he stood upon them . and was about to be executed , he said , every one condemned to die may once before his death speak . shall i also have that privilege ? yes , answered the king .
after this the prince could no longer doubt that she was quite as clever as he was . and now he felt bound to perform the vow that he had made . which was just what he most wished to do , so he rode forth with all his royal train to the cottage in the wild wood . and he told the old people that he had come to woo their daughter for his bride . if she were willing , and she was willing , the old folk were very down hearted at parting from their child .
that honest voice -- oh , could i hear it now , that honest face . oh , could i see it again , and , oh , that once more i could feel the clasp of that brave hand and the cordial [female] of that dear , noble presence ! it was in the fall of the year . the nights were long , yet this night sped quickly , long before daybreak significant sounds in the back room betokened that miss [female] was up and moving around . through the closed door and from behind the improvised rampart of wood box and small trunk the young lady informed her chivalric protectors that they might go home .
when [male] saw that the ape had turned himself into so contemptible a creature as a buzzard . he would no longer play the game of changing form with him . he reappeared in his original form , took up his crossbow and shot at the bird . the buzzard slipped and fell down the side of the cliff . at its foot the ape turned himself into the chapel of a field god .
the maid stayed beneath the lime tree until sunset , but he did not return . she sat three days from morning till evening . waiting for him , but in vain , as he still was not there by the fourth day . she said , some accident has assuredly befallen him . i will go out and seek him , and will not come back until i have found him .
now the prince had a most beautiful voice and used also to play on the one stringed lute . he used often to sit up half the night singing and playing to himself . one night as he sat singing . he heard a laugh and looking round saw a beautiful bonga girl . he asked who she was and how she had come there .
on hearing this the old man and his wife were very happy , they had cried night and day for sorrow at having no child to help them in their lonely old age . and now that their prayer was answered they were so lost with joy that they did not know where to put their hands or their feet . first the old man took the child up in his arms . and then the old woman did the same ; and they named him [male] . or son of a peach , because he had come out of a peach .
aïdes , who was universally worshipped throughout [male] , had temples erected to his honour in [male] . [male] , and also at athens , his sacrifices . which took place at night , consisted of black sheep . and the blood , instead of being sprinkled on the altars or received in vessels . as at other sacrifices , was permitted to run down into a trench , dug for this purpose .
but there is a proverb which says that ill gotten gains never prosper , and the prince found that the stolen ring brought him ill luck after all . the witch maiden had never rested night nor day until she had found out where the ring was . as soon as she had discovered by means of magical arts that the prince in the form of a bird was on his way to [location] . she changed herself into an eagle and watched in the air until the bird she was waiting for came in sight . for she knew him at once by the ring which was hung round his neck by a ribbon .
the other fairies came , and they said that [female] should be the kindest and the cleverest princess ever seen . her eyes should be as blue as forget me nots , her smile as bright as the morning . her hands as delicate as snowdrops , and her heart of pure gold . moreover , she should sing like a lark . and ride wild horses , and do needlework better than all other princesses , towards the end of the feast .
nay , said [female] , if this be the case . i will kill you at once , so saying , he slipped nimbly behind him . and jumping upon the block of timber , as the giant rose from it . he stabbed him in the back . when , after a few howls , he dropped down dead , [male] cut off his head .
he was carried off to the prison where the heathen king kept his captives . and now our poor friend had a very bad time indeed , all night long the prisoners were chained up . and in the morning they were yoked together like oxen and had to plough the land till it grew dark . this state of things went on for three years before the king found any means of sending news of himself to his dear queen . but at last he contrived to send this letter : sell all our castles and palaces .
the prince of [location] then asked her . if she knew what became of the horse , after the death of the hindoo magician . to which she answered , that she knew not what orders the sultan had given . but supposed , after the account she had given him of it . he would take care of it as a curiosity .
when king [male] heard the news . and how so many of his best knights had been put to death by his page . he was beside himself with fury . and gave orders that [male] should be instantly beheaded , but [male] . his daughter , pleaded so hard for the young page that the king agreed to hear his story .
little by little the freshened air and the stir of leaves began to foretell the coming of the dawn . finally , just as the dawn star began to pale , [male] and [male] hurried out of the prison through the twenty doors . and fled to the highroad , the poor prince picked up the [male] and hobbled forward as fast as he could go . forgetting the dreadful pain it caused him . but the dogs were running a hundred times faster than he .
they were two young people with heads hot enough and hearts true enough to believe that the world was well lost for love . and they were chinese , they sat beneath the shade of a cluster of tall young pines forming a perfect bower of greenness and coolness on the slope of [male] . their eyes were looking ocean wards , following a ship nearing the misty horizon . very serious were their faces and voices , that ship , sailing from west to east . carried from each a message to his and her kin—a message which humbly but firmly set forth that they were resolved to act upon their belief and to establish a home in the new country .
`` somerset house , '' ordered [female] . after quickly lifting [female] in , and [female] had closed the door smartly . on the way there they behaved much better than they usually did when they drove out . no one fidgeted ; no one complained of feeling hungry , or thirsty . or tired , or anything , when they alighted the cabman was told to wait .
i stepped forward and looked there , on an end of wood pile which we children had pulled down so as to make a slope to ascend its heights . a man was sitting , his head and shoulders were drooping . his legs were relaxed , and his hands were hanging loose , as if they were heavy . his eyes were closed and his lips were parted , yet about the face . with its fair hair and beard , there was something singularly attractive and [male] .
leaving the other three to watch over , feed , and protect their wounded brother . the travelers set forth , sorry to leave home . but resolved that the first promise of spring should bring them back again . at the close of day , the three brothers who remained . mounting to the very peak of the tree , and bearing gray eagle in their arms .
but in this case no thing would have passed from me to you but a movement or wave . which passed along the boards of the floor , again , if i speak to you . how does the sound reach you ear ? not by anything being thrown from my mouth to your ear . but by the motion of the air , when i speak i agitate the air near my mouth .
her father agreed at once , as he always did agree to any of her wishes . and sent a messenger in haste to the farmer 's house to ask if his daughter would come to the castle to be the princess 's waiting maid . and , of course , the farmer was very pleased at the piece of good fortune which had befallen the girl . and so was her mother , and so were her six brothers . all except poor [male] , who looked with [male] eyes after his sister as she rode away .
he would have been less anxious to enter on this perilous course , had he known that the innocent looking traders who preceded him were every one of them demons who had changed themselves into the semblance of men in order to lure him to his destruction . [male] and his companions had not proceeded more than five or six miles . when ominous symptoms of coming disaster began to manifest themselves . the extreme cold in the air suddenly ceased , and a warm south wind began to blow . the surface of the ice lost its hardness .
these arakkaboans only gloated on him , and slowly turned their round heads . still twitching their ears at one another , as if in some strange talk , and nod fell into a munza rage at sight of them . he danced and gibbered , and at last caught up his long water pole , as if to strike at them . but it was too heavy for him after his long thirst ; he over balanced . threw out the pole , and fell headlong on to the raft , [male] muttered in his sleep .
now brave little [female] did not know the sly cunning of his foes . the fleeing ones scattered broadly as they made for their home . the strongest among them , however , stopped a moment and , hiding themselves . noticed that [male] was riding almost alone , having outridden his own troop , then they ran as fast as they could to their home . where they found a swarm of slaves awaiting the results of the main battle .
the boy stood still for a moment , looked first one way and then another . but could see nothing , of course the truth was that the fairies were there . and [male] knew it , but had no means of letting his master know . for he did not happen to understand english or french , and even in dog latin would have made but a poor hand in conversing with human beings . but animals , as is well known , can often see fairies and such creatures when they are invisible to human eye .
but the princess took no part in any of the rejoicings . she sat and grieved and grieved , the horse would not eat and the bird would not sing . the king was greatly distressed over all this , he could not guess what ailed them all . the fox then let its tail hang down in the well . the prince caught hold of it .
it could not be possible that the cottage had grown , but why was he obliged to take so many more steps than usual to get to the table ? and what was the matter with the chair ? it looked no bigger than it did a while ago . but now he had to step on the rung first , and then clamber up in order to reach the seat . it was the same thing with the table . he could not look over the top without climbing to the arm of the chair .
the rebel vizier had entertained a mortal hatred against me for a long time upon this occasion . when , i was a stripling , i loved to shoot with a cross bow . and being one day upon the terrace of the palace with my bow . a bird happened to come by ; i shot . but missed him , and the ball by misfortune hit the vizier .
but after a while , the children began to think it was time to have another story . and to wonder if their old friend had forgotten them , or possibly gone away . there was no use hunting any more for the hidden door ; they had hurt their fingers and tired themselves to no purpose in doing so already . and at last they came to the conclusion that if mrs caretaker did not want them to find it . it was no use trying , and that if she did .
what 's the good of my saving money ? can i take it away with me when i die ? my father and grandfather did not do so , and they had enough to live on till they died . i have enough for what i want , and i have plenty poor relations . they all come to me , asking for money . and i give it them , i thank our saviour there are enough good christians here to give me a slice of bread and cup of water when i can not work for it .
the hero still grasped his sword and looked warily along the walls of the water dwelling . lest some other foe should emerge from its recesses ; but as he gazed [male] saw his former foe . [male] , lying dead on a bed in some inner hall . he strode thither , and , seizing the corpse by the hideous coiled locks . shore off the head to carry to earth again , the poisonous hot blood of the monster melted the blade of the mighty sword .
on the eleventh stroke of the old church bell . the park street church at brimstone corner took up the [female] . [female] by a mighty effort recalled the charm before the second sonorous voice had died on the still air . suddenly another electric light on the path below sprang into brightness . and sent a light streak across the shadow of the elms .
so young hamish [female] led [female] across the mountains to the place where his father 's captors . the horsemen of the lennox , had taken up their position on a rocky eminence . where they would be safe from any sudden attack of the mountaineers . before parting he made [male] promise not to reveal . either who had guided him thither , or where he had parted from his conductor .
it was only by immense leaps to right and left that [male] could save his head from the sturdy blows which fell about him on every side . like pine.trees , from the hands of the manito . he was badly bruised , and at his very wits end , when a large woodpecker flew past and lit on a tree . it was a bird he had known on the prairie .
after this came a millstone , then an egg , then a duck . then a pin , and at last a needle , who all seated themselves in the carriage . and drove with them , when , however , they reached the house of [female] . [female] was not there , the mice drew the carriage into the barn . the hen flew with the cock upon a perch .
by this time the people of the house were all gathered at the gate . but [female] stood alone in front of them . when the horseman pulled up , she ran to the side of the white horse . and held up her arms , the king stooped , and took her hands . in an instant she was on the saddle , and clasped in his great strong arms .
in her sudden joy at learning that her lover was alive and near at hand . [female] forgot all , and , as the gibbous moon was already brightening the horizon . she arose and cloaked herself and stole down the stairway of the palace . she reached the side door unobserved . she passed out and closed it behind her .
the demon rejoiced that he was allowed to be in the room along with the damsel . and in his happiness asked her what he should give her to help her to while away the time . the damsel was now more curious than ever about the talisman , and she coaxed and coaxed till at last she persuaded the demon to tell her about the talisman . but not till she had granted his request that he might sit down quite close to her . the damsel could not refuse him that happiness .
i ran down the cypress alley to the deserted audience chamber . i looked through the cobweb at urban , and by the dim light of the high window saw him sitting there motionless as stone . in the same attitude as before , `` i am here , '' i cried . but he neither moved nor spoke , i applied the shears . and in a moment the cobweb was hanging in shreds .
the great setchene frowned , and waved his wand over his head . instantly the sky became covered with clouds , the fire went down . snow fell in large flakes , an icy wind howled round the mountain . amid the fury of the storm [female] added curses against her step-sister . the pelisse failed to warm her benumbed limbs , the mother kept on waiting for her .
when the sun rose , the palace was still astir , none had slept . so none had dreamed ; therefore , when eyes met eyes . the truth was known : a terrible thing had happened , but none knew how it had happened . all sought to find some clue to explain the disappearance of the eldest princess . but there was no clue to the midnight mystery of the thing .
the moon up yonder shone and shone . just as she does now , and when she shone she lighted up the bog pools . so that one could walk about almost as safe as in the day , but when she did not shine . out came the things that dwelt in the darkness and went about seeking to do evil and harm . bogles and crawling horrors , all came out when the moon did not shine .
the new cowboy drove the cattle to pasture , and when near the land of the giant . he saw it was covered with woods and surrounded by a high wall . he went up , put his back against the wall . and threw in a great stretch of it ; then he went inside and threw out another great stretch of the wall . and put the five golden cows and the bull without horns on the land of the giant .
during the night the fire died down and a village dog which was on the prowl came and coiled itself up on the warm ashes and also went to sleep alongside [male] . meanwhile the headman who had bought the dog sent for his labourers and told them of his luck in finding such a valuable animal . he bade them tie it up at the door of the hut on the threshing floor in which they slept . and in the morning to lead it round with them as they drove the oxen that trod out the grain . and then they would none of them feel cold .
but as he fell , he ceased to be a frog . and became all at once a prince with beautiful kind eyes . and it came to pass that , with her father 's consent . they became bride and bridegroom , and he told her how a wicked witch had bound him by her spells . and how no one but she alone could have released him .
this task for a man whose only tools are sticks is no slight one . a huge bowlder in the ground means hours . often days -- of patient , animal like digging and prying with hands and sticks before it is finally dislodged . when the ground is leveled the soil is put back over the plat . and very often is supplemented with other rich soil , these irrigated sementeras are built along water courses or in such places as can be reached by turning running water to them .
the busy [female] toiled all day over her duties in doors . and when evening came , would go out on the rocks to await [female] 's return . the greatest pleasure she now had was in singing . her voice grew strong and firm , and every day at sunset it might be heard . in waves of melody , mingling with the sound of the breakers on the shore .
no beauty , no talent , has power above some indefinite charm discern would only by love . the princes were much surprised at the fancy of their father to have a little dog . yet they accepted the proposition with pleasure . and accordingly , after taking leave of the king , who presented them with abundance of money and jewels . and appointed that day twelvemonth for their return , they set off on their travels .
after having walked half the day they reached a town that was called `` trap for blockheads . '' as soon as [male] entered this town he saw that the streets were crowded with dogs who were yawning from hunger . shorn sheep [male] with cold , cocks without combs begging for a grain of indian corn . large butterflies that could no longer fly because they had sold their beautiful colored wings . peacocks which had no tails and were ashamed to be seen , and pheasants that went scratching about in a subdued fashion .
so he took down the golden saddle and laid it on the horse . as soon as he did so , the horse began to neigh and stamp . the sound awoke the stableman , and he called the guard . the soldiers came running in haste and seized the prince and carried him before the king and told him the youth had been trying to steal the golden horse . well , the prince did not see how he was to find the princess of the golden castle .
on the next audience day , when [female] 's mother went to the divan . and placed herself in front of the sultan as usual . the grand vizier immediately called the chief of the mace bearers . and pointing to her bade him bring her before the sultan . the old woman at once followed the mace bearer , and when she reached the sultan bowed her head down to the carpet which covered the platform of the throne .
there lay the great fiery dragon in the sun . sound asleep , and so the faithful servant had time to look about him . not far away was a great deep trench like a drain in a swampy field . that was a path that the dragon had made by going to the river for a drink of water every day . the faithful servant dug a hole in the bottom of this trench .
shortly after the marriage of [female] and [female] . [female] went to live with her daughter , the dike by the sea was splendidly repaired without any dispute . for the estate once more belonged to the two brothers in common , and [female] found in praxilla a new , kind mother . the marble seat , on which the young people 's fate was decided . was called by the grandchildren of the wedded pair , who lived to old age in love and harmony .
the count had often urged [female] to marry , but in vain . the lady had no mind to lose her freedom . dancing was the one passion of her life . when , said she , i can find a knight who shall be able to dance continuously with me for twelve hours . with no break , to him i promise to give my hand !
he heard at once , through the servant , of his neighbor 's good luck in losing the lump on his face . so he called that very evening and asked his friend to tell him everything that concerned the loss of it . the good old man told his disagreeable neighbor all that had happened to him . he described the place where he would find the hollow tree in which to hide . and advised him to be on the spot in the late afternoon towards the time of sunset .
the brothers came forward affectionately to welcome him , and his inauguration was as a sunday feast . heaven seemed to him to dwell in the [male] of the church . and to beam upon him from the holy pictures and from the cross . and when , in the evening , at the sunset hour . he stood in his little cell , and , opening the window .
this my poor brother had not expected ; already , before this , he had determined to go in search of his sister and her friend . after having asked the blessing of his father upon his efforts . and now that father had sent him forth into the world . laden with his curse , as , however , his former grief had bowed him down . so this consummation of misfortune , which he had not deserved .
when the wicked [female] heard the sweet singing of the apple . her grief was excessive , for instead of doing harm to these lovely children . she only did them good by her perfidious counsels . she allowed some days to pass by without showing herself . and then once more made the princess unhappy by saying that the dancing water and the singing apple were useless without the little green bird that tells everything .
in the corner where he had stood the three umbrellas . he saw the three wild babylonian baboons on the floor . sleeping , with umbrellas over their faces , `` the umbrellas were so big they couldn '' t get through the door , said hatrack the horse . for a long time he stood looking at the bangs hanging down the foreheads of the baboons while they were sleeping .
instantly others fell to fighting hand to hand , striking on targe and helm . but sir [male] , sir [male] and sir [male] surrounded the king . and all hurried back to the army approaching them , so likewise did sir [male] . then came the crash of battle , as line on line . with flashing swords held high , the ranks of war closed .
when the dwarf had come to the end of his story . he very politely bade me goodbye , and bowed me out of his castle . a week or two later we went to saltzburg , and there i had a real adventure . the professor with whom we were staying had not a single grandchild . and as all his books were old and dusty , to say nothing of being written in german .
a silver key once admitted me to a private inspection of the relics . we were ushered , my friend and myself . into a back apartment of the spacious temple , overlooking one of those [female] miniature gardens . cunningly adorned with rockeries and dwarf trees . in which the japanese delight , one by one , carefully labelled and indexed boxes containing the precious articles were brought out and opened by the chief priest .
then the poet stood up and told them one of his poems . it was about the people who lived on the dark side of the city . and it was very fierce , and bitter , and passionate . and when he had finished telling it , he expected to be thrust out of the palace and banished from the country . for that was what usually happened to him , there was a great silence when he sat down again .
at last the king hit upon a plan , in some woods close by there lived two giants . who were the terror of the country side . they robbed all the travelers , and if any resistance was offered they killed the men on the spot . the tailor chose ten strong men , and told them to await him on the border of the wood . while he went on quite alone , he could hear the giants snoring for quite half an hour before he reached them .
several years had passed , and the spring festival was returning . all was green and blooming ; the trees and hedges were already in full leaf . and rock , vale , [person] and [person] were clothed with their new dress . the rootmen had already quitted their dark winter quarters , and betaken themselves to their summer abodes by the cool brook . which now once more ran purling merrily along , all awaited with eager expectation the appearance of the winged guests .
my old granny lived till she was nearly a hundred ; when she got very old she rather lost her memory . and often made mistakes in the stories she told us . telling a bit of one story and then joining on to it a bit of some other . for we children bothered her too much about them . and sometimes she used to get very tired of talking , and when we asked her for a story .
faster and faster , they chirped and they chattered , chased and romped all over the place . they scattered the salt ; they spilt the barm . they upset the flour—all for sheer fun . the fire on the hearth blazed and shone . crackled and glowed ; and the old woman gazed and gazed , she never regretted the salt nor the barm .
still , she felt she would like to pay him out . all the same -- he would had such a lovely time being fairy godmother ! so she decided , like the weather , that it was not grown-up to cry . and she dried her eyes . then all at once she smiled and laughed outright , for an idea had come to her .
the sultan of kashgar no sooner heard these words than he ordered an usher to go to the chief of police and to bring all the persons concerned in the hunchback 's death . together with the corpse , that he wished to see once again , the usher hastened on his errand . but was only just in time , for the tailor was positively swinging in the air . when his voice fell upon the silence of the crowd . commanding the hangman to cut down the body , the hangman .
well , the kitchen maid gave him leave to go , but he must promise to be back by the time the roast was turned . and he was to mind and bring a big bundle of wood with him . so shortshanks had scarce got down to the strand , when the ogre came tearing along in his ship . so that the wind howled and roared around him ; he was twice as big as the other ogre . and he had ten heads on his shoulders .
and , as he prayed , [male] more and more in size . falling to the ground , where he lay writhing to and fro like a worm . `` gently , master [male] , '' cried [male] . retreating a step and holding up the cross in front of him . i laid the trap for you this time .
then they all went on to another bazar and bought dried rice and sweetmeats and curds and had a grand feast . then their father proceeded to point out to his sons how , except the youngest . they were all useless ; they had been unable to cross the channel or to make anything of their own pice of capital . they had nothing to answer , and all went home and from that day nothing was heard of any proposal to divide the family until the old father and mother died . there were once seven brothers and they had one sister who was the youngest of the family .
therewith sir [male] put his spear in its rest . and ran straight upon him , and fair hands came on just as fast with his sword in his hand . and so he put away his spear with his sword . and with a foin thrust him through the side . so that sir [male] fell down as if he were dead .
gold and silver had been scattered as they travelled . and for each piece that fell there formed later a splendid mine . the precious metal , melting and filtering through the earth in slender veins . reached finally the heart of the deepest mountains , there it spread and grew . until today the earth is full of its treasures in gold and silver mines .
when i had all things completed , i presented them to the king . and put them upon one of his horses , his majesty mounted immediately . and was so mightily pleased with them , that he testified his satisfaction by large presents to me . i could not avoid making several others for his ministers and principal officers of his household . who all of them made me presents that enriched me in a little time .
at last the stricken man poured forth his tale , and the red cross knight learned that once he was happy and free . like other men , till on an ill starred day he and a friend had fallen in with a cursed wight who called himself `` despair , '' who had plucked all hope from their breasts , and bade them seek death . the one with a rope , the other with a knife . his friend , whose love had been disdained by a proud lady .
so they parted from sir persaunt and rode onwards . and the lady spoke now full friendly to [male] , in a little while . when they had passed through a fair forest , they came upon a plain . and in the distance was a high castle with many tents about it . and men passing to and fro between them , and as they rode under some withered trees by the edge of the forest .
fearful of disturbing the dead , he did not dare to visit the place where he had deposited her remains . he , however , engaged his son to entice the boy to a dead tree . by the edge of a wood , where they could kill many flying squirrels by setting it on fire . he said that he would conceal himself near by . and take the boy , the next day the hunter accordingly went into the woods .
when any one asked him anything and so they called him [male] ' . one day when he was out , he met atoukama . [female] 's wife , who was going along driving an ox . but the ox would not walk , so atoukama asked [female] to help her ; and they got on pretty well . till they came to a river , when the ox would not cross through the water .
by that time he hoped he would have so many things to think about that he would have forgotten to trouble about the little son who never came . the country the king reigned over was very large , and full of high , stony mountains and sandy deserts . so that it was not at all easy to go from one place to another . one day the king had wandered out alone , meaning to go only a little distance . but everything looked so alike he could not make out the path by which he had come .
the soldiers and men at arms slumbered as they stood . the page boy fell asleep writh his mouth wide open , and a fly that had just been going to settle on his nose fell asleep too in mid-air . although the sun had been shining brightly when the princess took the spindle in her hand . no sooner did she prick herself with the point than deep shadows darkened the sunny rooms and gardens . this sudden darkness had been caused by a magic wood which had sprung up all around the palace and its grounds .
the sultan was much concerned at the vizier 's affliction . approved his resolution , and gave him leave to travel , he caused a passport also to be written for him . requesting in the strongest terms all kings and princes in whose dominions [male] ad deen might sojourn . to grant that the vizier might conduct him to [male] . [male] , not knowing how to express his gratitude to the sultan .
in the middle of the twelfth century , the nobles of the court . who went to the wars , all blackened their teeth ; and from this time forth the practice became a fashion of the court . the followers of the chiefs of the hojo dynasty also blackened their teeth . as an emblem of their fidelity ; and this was called the odawara fashion . after the castle town of the family , thus a custom .
little [male] , however , was not disconcerted by their laughter , he proudly walked forward . supported by his cane , and awaited his opponent , at [male] 's own desire . the overseer of the slaves had selected the best runner . walking in , he placed himself near the dwarf . and both looked for the signal , thereupon the princess [female] made a sign with her veil as had been preconcerted .
nancy followed [male] 's movements with breathless interest as he flitted to each little sleeping occupant of the hospital ward . for such it was -- placing here a toy horse of skin and harness with a long wavy tail . there a lovely picture book with a green cover , on which the title was printed in large gold letters . twice only did [female] heave a little sigh , quickly repressed , and her eyes filled with longing . once when a skipping rope was loosely tied round the clasped hands of a little girl who was convalescent .
or sometimes when he could manage it he would get behind her chair . put on a pair of spectacles , and imitate her very cleverly to make the people laugh . by and by he began to mimic the speech and gait of persons in the street . all that was peculiar or disagreeable in a person he would imitate directly , and people said . `` that boy will be very clever ; he has a remarkable genius . ''
so they made a great wedding feast , which lasted seven whole days . and who so happy as [female] and [female] ? and [female] rose to give her the sword . and the cap , and the sandals ; but he woke . and his dream vanished away , and yet it was not altogether a dream . for the goat skin with the head was in its place ; but the sword .
the su pa la' do continue to eat meat , but wash and cleanse it thoroughly before cooking . they are said also not to hold any of the ceremonials associated with the old faith . they keep a white flag flying from a pole near their dwelling . or at least one such flag in the section of the pueblo in which they reside . they also believe that [male] will return to them in the near future .
no answer , another old man , in bed . turns himself and coughs , that old man says nothing . but another old man , a tall old man of very good address . speaking with perfect correctness , comes forward from somewhere , and volunteers an answer . the reply almost always proceeds from a volunteer .
the lad stretched back his arm and poured the water out from the jug . but his haste was such that three drops fell upon the horse 's flanks . immediately a great lake rose about them , and because of the three drops that had fallen on the horse . the lake was not only behind them but about them , too . the steed had to swim for it , the trolls came to the edge of the lake .
alas , her father had then deceived her that he might keep her at home . her heart had told her the truth , and she . instead of listening to its entreaties , had weakly yielded to persuasion , and broken her sacred promise , and now ? too late , too late -- all was over , full of grief and despair . she hastened out of the house to pour out her heart in bitter weeping amid the stillness of the night .
since the beginning of the world the serpent has been regarded as the most mystic of reptiles . he was called `` more subtil than any beast of the field , '' from the day on which he spoke to [female] and said that if she ate of the fruit of the tree of life . her eyes should be opened and she should surely not die , and he has been endowed with human powers again and again . worshipped as a god in every part of the world and depicted in ancient art as possessed of human form and attributes .
armagnac and brun instantly stood up ; but they were too late , men were already running from the street corners . there was a small but ever clustering crowd , with the prompt french instinct for the politics of the street . the man with the black [male] had already run across to a corner of the cafe . sprung on one of the tables , and seizing a branch of chestnut to steady himself . shouted as [male] desmoulins once shouted when he scattered the oak leaves among the populace .
on midsummer [person] , when the bonfires are lighted on every hill in honour ofjohn . the fairies are at their gayest , and sometime steal away beautiful mortals to be their brides . on november [person] they are at their gloomiest , for , according to the old gaelic reckoning . this is the first night of winter , this night they dance with the ghosts . and the [person] is abroad , and witches make their spells .
not without gifts went [male] 's men forth . that they might fare the better on the road , [male] commended him to [male] and her sons . never margrave was so true to them as he , to [male] . likewise , they commended their true service and their steadfast faith and love . when the envoys had heard the message , they set out again .
the little maid , who was still watching the geese , nodded kindly to him as he passed through the gate . days and weeks passed , and it was seen that the broken willow branch which the peddlar had stuck into the ground near the ditch remained fresh and green . nay , it even put forth fresh twigs ; the little goose girl saw that the branch had taken root . and was very pleased ; the tree , so she said , was now her tree . while the tree was advancing , everything else at the castle was going backward .
what i can say on the word of a historian is that the feast . interrupted for a moment , went on gayer than ever , early the next morning they went to the church . where , to the joy of his heart , [male] married [male] . who was no longer afraid of evil spirits ; after which they ate . drank , and danced for thirty six hours , without any one thinking of resting .
i may say here , as regards these colours . that , so far as my observation went , the colours of the decorative patterns were always black and red . and the general staining was always yellow ; and indeed the last mentioned colour does not show up against the natural colour of the cloth sufficiently clearly to adapt it for actual design work . i am not , however , prepared to say that this allocation of the colours is in fact an invariable one . and , as i know that red is used for general staining of perineal bands and dancing ribbons .
farmers know too well of the many restless nights the cows and horses [female] through rats . i have seen when trapping all night at a farm the rats running over the cows and horses whilst sleeping . and when horses have been working in the field all day they want better rest in the night . i have known when farmers would not let the rat catcher ferret their buildings gratis . simply because they have a few hens sitting , they do not consider that when the hens have hatched the eggs the rats will take the chickens .
the wizards of [female] are said to be able to become hyanas at will . and in `` the life of nathaniel [male] '' the story is told of a man called coffin who was asked by a servant for leave of absence . no sooner had he granted the request than one of the other servants called out . `` look , look , he has turned himself into a hyana ! '' coffin gazed in the direction in which the first servant had disappeared .
there are many persons who differ in their account of this part of the story . and who pretend that little [male] never committed this robbery , and that he only considered himself justified in taking the ogre 's seven league boots . because he used them expressly to run after little children . these people assert that they have heard it from good authority . and that they have even eaten and drunk in the woodcutter 's house .
and the moon rose and illumined the river , the waves beat against the banks . and the forest rustled , but they still sat there and talked , suddenly it seemed as if a small black cloud was passing over the moon . and all at once something like a large folded shawl fell at their feet . then the moon stood out again in her full glory , they lifted up the cloth and began to spread it out . but they took a long time over this , for it was very fine and folded many hundred times .
thus , poor as ever , wandered the little fellow forth through the land , cursing the folly which had led him astray . and prevented his playing an important part at court , the land from which he was banished . was fortunately not extensive , and accordingly eight hours brought him to the frontier . but travelling , now that he was used to his dear slippers , came very hard to him . having arrived at the border , he chose the usual road for reaching the most lonely part of the forest .
for two days she floated hither and thither over the sea . soaked to the skin , nigh dead with cold , and so nearly benumbed that but for little [female] . who snuggled to her bosom , and kept a little warmth in her , she must have perished a hundred times . she was famished with hunger , but on seeing some oysters in their shells she took and ate as many as would appease her . [male] did the same , but only to keep himself alive , for he did not like them .
now as he lived there happily , lovely 's brother came to visit , and when they had all asked him about his health and his sister had greeted him with a kiss . and after he had rested , he said : `` my father sent me to invite lovely and white to a festival in our house . '' and all the relatives said it was a good plan and entertained him that day with appropriate things to drink and eat . the next morning white set out for his father in law 's house . together with his brother in law and lovely , and when he came to the city beautiful .
all the birds who had sung to her so sweetly were flown away , and the trees and the flowers had withered . the large clover leaf under the shelter of which she had lived . was now rolled together and shrivelled up , nothing remained but a yellow withered stalk . she felt dreadfully cold , for her clothes were torn , and she was herself so frail and delicate . that , poor little thing , she was nearly frozen to death !
stepped out faster , for both the diamonds were just grandly obedient , and diamond soon found that . as he was obedient to his father , so the horse was obedient to him . for he had not ridden far before he found courage to reach forward and catch hold of the bridle . and when his father , whose hand was upon it . felt the boy pull it towards him .
and they begin to fight , after a long combat , this giant also shared the fate of the former two . and the lad cut his throat , then he brought together the three maidens . who told him that they were daughters of three princes and had been stolen by these giants . who nourished them with the apples of life . then they showed him their houses .
thus she lamented ; and although the king wrote daily to her , and sent her good news of the progress of the siege . she grew more and more unhappy , and at last determined that she would return to him . knowing , however , that the officers who were in attendance upon her had received orders not to take her back . unless the king sent a special messenger , she kept her design secret . but ordered a small chariot to be built for her , in which there was only room for one .
the corollary to the above sentence , and which with it completes the abstract statement of [location] 's whole policy . is : the west of [location] shall not dominate the east . to the russian people belong the myth tales in the first division of this volume . i had hoped to include specimens from little and white [location] . that is , from those parts of [location] that were once under the dominion of [location] .
then they went to bed , but very early in the morning . when it was neither dusk nor dawn , there was a noise in the doorway like `` durrrrrr ! ', ', daddy ! '' cried the old woman , there 's some one scratching at the door . go and see who it is , the old man went out , and there was the bear carrying a whole hive full of honey . the old man took the honey from the bear .
on the second afternoon the prince , in his impatience . came early to the shadowy garden , the princess [female] was not to be found . so [female] wandered away into the dark alleys by the pools . suddenly he found himself looking at his own reflection in a huge round mirror which two marble statues supported between them . one at each side , happening to move a little , the prince discovered that his reflection did not move !
the general certainly seemed to grow an inch taller , assumed a more stately demeanor . and took two steps backward and one step forward , as if he were dancing a minuet . and then came as much gravity and expression into the face of the general as the general could contrive to infuse into it . but he replied , i never retract my words ! you are invited , professor , and he bowed with a glance at the king .
the cowboy did as he was told , and threw the pin into the fishing bag . where it remained without harm to any one . the cowboy went back to his cattle , and the prince fished on as before . the three swans were out in the middle of the lake swimming around for themselves in the water . and the prince moved on , fishing , till he came to a bend in the shore .
the king held out his sceptre to her ; and again the mist came up from the ground and enwrapped the [male] throne . and the figures of the king and the chancellor wavered and became dim before her . were they the king and the chancellor ? was not what she saw , so dim through the mist , the figures of the shepherd who had helped her on glenollisdal and his black collie ? but the mist was wavering again about them , and again all was a blur .
and accordingly [female] the dullard was made a king . and received a crown and a wife , and sat upon a throne . and this report we have wet from the press of the head clerk and the corporation of printers . but they are not to be depended upon in the least , in the high road which led through a wood stood a solitary farm house . the road , in fact , ran right through its yard .
when [female] heard this terrible threat . he took to his heels , and ran from the most enormous house of [male] the giant . and he ran , and ran , till his coat was torn and his ears were red . and he never rested till he reached his cottage door . and got inside , [male] laughed till he cried to see the little gnome run .
br'er fox crept up a little nigher . he did , and he listen , but he hear nothing . and he kept on getting nigher , and yet he hear nothing . by and by he get up close , he peep down . he see nothing , and he hear nothing .
this agreement being made , [female] brought in supper . and after the room was set round with tapers that were mixed with aloes and ambergris . which gave a most agreeable scent , as well as a delicate light , she sat down at table with her sisters and the porter . they began again to eat and drink , to sing and repeat verses . the ladies took pleasure to inebriate the porter .
then noodle laughed softly and dropped his ring , the sweetener , into the hand that held the grain . and barely had he offered the corn before he felt the silver plough nozzling at his palm . and eating as a horse eats from the hand of its master . then he whistled again , placing the sweetener back between his lips . and the galloping plough sprang after him .
the shock of that morning had so told on the health of [female] 's wife that she died shortly afterwards . leaving him with one daughter , [female] -- a proud . sprightly , sentimental girl , whom he had brought home . and placed under the care of a friend named [female] . whose house stood upon one of the cumberland lakes .
happily , the practice was very bad ; for had the men of bizen been good shots . almost all the principal foreign officials in the country , besides many merchants and private gentlemen . must have been killed : as it was , only two or three men were wounded . if they were bad marksmen , however , they were mighty runners . for they soon found that they had attacked a hornets ', nest .
there remained a laughing and crying and loving servant who wanted to tie himself into knots if that would please the son of his great captain . [male] went home on the robber 's shoulder . and the robber gave great snorts and made great jumps and behaved like a first rate horse . for this same [female] was the husband of [female] . [female] 's aunt , he had taken to the wilds when clann baiscne was broken .
so the old woman took her up to a hut in a wood . and left her there as a punishment ; and she took her food every day . one day it happened that the king 's servant . going that way , saw the beautiful girl come out of the hut . next day he went again and saw the same beautiful girl again .
i wish i could describe the king , so that you could see him in your mind . he had [male] blue eyes . but a nose that made him look like an eagle . a long dark beard , streaked with silvery lines . flowed from his mouth almost to his waist , and as [female] sat on the saddle and hid her glad face upon his bosom .
sometimes she tried to sing , but she found her voice was not in the least like the nightingale 's . one day she heard some of the maids talking together . they were speaking of the wise man . the magician , who lived in the dark cave on the side of the hill . and could do the most wonderful things , in fact , they said .
you might bring me one or two. [female] turned round to pluck them . and found herself face to face with the gardener . who caught hold of her , exclaiming , what are you doing here . you little thief ? ' about call me names , she said , or you will get the worst of it ,
carroll [female] used to go roving about from one place to another . and the fear of nothing stopped him . he would as soon pass an old churchyard or a regular fairy ground . at any hour of the night as go from one room into another . without ever making the sign of the cross , or saying , `` good luck attend you , gentlemen . ''
in summer , he 's pinched for a living and cowers o'er the fire pot in winter . for warmth and for light , the curs of the street dog his heels . as he goes , and the scurviest rascal may rail at the wight , if he lift up his voice to complain of his case . he finds not a soul who will pity his plight . since such is the life and the lot of the poor , it were better he lay in the graveyard forthright !
alla ad deen waited till the three months were completed . which the sultan had appointed for the consummation of the marriage between the princess [female] al buddoor and himself . and the next day sent his mother to the palace . to remind the sultan of his promise , [male] ad deen 's mother went to the palace . and stood in the same place as before in the hall of audience .
and without another word the little creature disappeared , leaving [female] still lamenting on the ground . it were too long a tale to tell how the three animal friends met and planned together . how they went at night to the palace of the wicked merchant . crept to his room , and how the ape and the bear waited breathlessly outside while the mouse climbed through the keyhole and stole the talisman from the breast of the sleeping man . they had little trouble in passing the many guards .
the beginning was in broad daylight on a bright blue day in august and in full sight of the windows of half a dozen houses . at first sight this alone is sufficient to make the popular want of information almost incredible . but of that you may think differently later , mrs. [female] two charming daughters were bathing at the time in company with their guest , miss [female] . it is from the latter lady chiefly . and from mrs. bunting , that i have pieced together the precise circumstances of the sea lady 's arrival .
so she bathed herself in a crystal waterfall . and then put on her coat of silver cloth . and hastened away to the ball , as soon as she entered all were overcome by her beauty and [male] . while the young lord at once lost his heart to her , he asked her to be his partner for the first dance . and he would dance with none other the live long night .
) , which gives excellent advice respecting the training of dogs . only speaks of traps and nets for capturing wild animals . amongst the greeks arrian and oppian , and amongst the romans . gratius faliscus and nemesianus , wrote on the same subject . their works , however , except in a few isolated or scattered passages , do not contain anything about venery properly so called .
`` i will pluck them , '' squeaked the youngest sparrow . who had as yet no feathers of his own , in the cottage dwelt two young married people . who loved each other very much and were industrious and active so that everything looked neat and pretty around them . early on sunday mornings the young wife came out , gathered a handful of the most beautiful roses . and put them in a glass of water .
but the gooseherd was never seen again , and no one knew what became of him . while the old lord went home once more to his palace by the sea . for he could not stay at court , when he had sworn never to look on his granddaughter 's face . so there he still sits by his window , -- if you could only see him . as you may some day -- weeping more bitterly than ever , and his white hair has bound him to the stones .
but the wizard with three dragons only laughed as he gazed into his crystal globe . for in it he could see everything that was happening in any place in the world . and i do not need [male] wise man to tell me that a globe like that is worth having ! now , when the prince had left the princess in fairyland . he lost no time in riding back to the west .
moreover , christians did not feel any scruple in parting with their most valued treasures . and giving them as pledges to the jews for a loan of money when they were in need of it . this plan of lending on pledge . or usury , belonged specially to the jews in [location] during the middle ages . and was both the cause of their prosperity and of their misfortune .
but the sprightly tailor gained his reward : for [male] paid him handsomely for the trews . and never discovered that a few of the stitches were somewhat long , there was a man in [male] once who was called [male] harper . the man was a right good man , and he had a goodly share of this world 's goods . he had a wife , but no family . what did [male] hear but that a soothsayer had come home to the place .
the judge then decreed that he should be dropped into the sea which covered his victims . when he heard this decision , he said that he had taken leave of his mother supposing that his head was to be cut off . and that , if he was to be drowned , he must go to her and make known his fate . and get her blessing anew , permission being given , he went and told his brothers what had happened . and the third brother took the place of the second , and presented himself before the judge as the criminal that was to be sunk in the sea .
after the tempest , it fell cold and very still , with sometimes a moaning in the air . strange weather was in the sky at rise and set of sun . and the three brothers , looking out , and seeing the numberless flights of birds winging with cries all in one direction . and hearing this moaning , hardly knew what to be doing , they went out every day to gather great bundles of wood and as many nuts and fruits and roots as they could carry . and they found everywhere wise creatures doing the same -- i mean , of course .
thinking seriously of what he should do , he began to fancy , for what reason he could not imagine . that some good spirit had made this mansion a present to him . with all the riches that it contained , this idea seemed like inspiration . and without further delay , making a new inspection of it . he took possession of all the treasures he could find .
of course somebody was forgotten , now it does not generally matter if somebody is forgotten . only you must mind who , unfortunately , the king forgot without intending to forget . and so the chance fell upon the princess makemnoit . which was awkward , for the princess was the king 's own sister . and he ought not to have forgotten her , but she had made herself so disagreeable to the old king .
king [male] , grateful for the love and devotion shown to him by his subjects under these trying circumstances . returned from captivity with the solemn intention of lightening the burdens which pressed upon them . and in consequence be began by spontaneously reducing the enormous wages which the tax gatherers had hitherto received . and by abolishing the tolls on highways , he also sold to the jews . at a very high price , the right of remaining in the kingdom and of exercising any trade in it .
as the lady [female] took her leave . there was a rustling of wings in the air . the chariot of [female] , with its attendant cockatrices . appeared on a level with the window : the fairy sprung into her seat . and , preceded by a cloud of lantern flies , each insect sparkling with a different coloured flame .
i ought to say , ere i forget , she was uncommon comely . ( who ever read a [female] tale yet , in which the girl was homely ? ) and so the king 's announcement drew nine princes in a column . but all in vain , the princess grew , if anything , more solemn . one read her `` innocents abroad , '' the next wore clothes eccentric .
suppose , then , that our [person] has begun to drink in water at its roots . how is it to get this water up into the stem and leaves . seeing that the whole plant is made of closed bags or cells ? it does it in a very curious way . which you can prove for yourselves , whenever two fluids .
the changeling was converted into the stock of a tree by saying a powerful rhyme over him . or by sticking him with a knife , he could be driven away by running at him with a red hot ploughshare . by getting between him and the bed and threatening him with a drawn sword . by leaving him out on the hillside , and paying no attention to his shrieking and screaming . by putting him sitting on a gridiron , or in a creel .
far from reproaching her for her long absence , the monster , as if the pleasure of seeing her had made him forget his past distresses . appeared , on entering beauty 's apartment , to have no other anxiety but that of ascertaining if she had been much amused . if she had been well received , and if her health had been good , she answered these questions . and added politely that she had paid dearly for all the pleasures his care had enabled her to enjoy . by the cruel pain she had endured on finding him in so sad a state on her return .
this wreck took place near sable island . and as most of the supplies for the expedition went down in the flag ship . the men in the remaining vessels grew so impatient as to compel a return . there were two vessels , the golden hind of forty tons . and the squirrel of ten tons , this last being a mere boat then called a frigate .
vyjhan , who accompanied [male] on his journey . was far from being a common mortal , he had a wonderful voice . if he cried in the east his voice would be heard in the west . after traveling for a long time , [male] and [male] came to a city and encamped upon a meadow outside the town . [male] was sleeping , when [male] heard a terrible uproar in the city and went there to inquire the cause of the trouble .
the rivals immediately descended to the palace court . on the stairs they saw a magpie and a [male] . the [male] cried ; `` fight it out , fight it out ! '' the magpie , `` do not fight , '' this made the prince laugh . the rivals scarcely noticed the two birds , the combat began .
with this he cut a piece off the beak . and there came a voice which said , `` oh , oh , you cut my little finger ! '' next moment [male] bright eye stood there . as lovely and beautiful as he had seen her when he was home , this was his sister now , he said . and the whole story now came out of how the other had behaved to her .
having parted with her lord , o toyo retired to her own room and went to bed . at midnight she awoke with a start . and became aware of a huge cat that crouched watching her ; and when she cried out . the beast sprang on her . and , fixing its cruel teeth in her delicate throat .
[female] therefore went down alone , and began to clean out the well , but the men had arranged how they were to act . and immediately each of them seized a stone from a heap of huge blocks . and threw them down above him , thinking to kill him with these . [male] , however , gave no more heed to this than to shout up to them . to keep the hens away from the well , for they were scraping gravel down on the top of him .
the rabbit , seeing that the farmer was growing calmer . went back to his home to lay his plans for the punishment of the badger . the next day the weather was fine , and the rabbit went out to find the badger . he was not to be seen in the woods or on the hillside or in the fields anywhere . so the rabbit went to his den and found the badger hiding there .
bahader , as usual , came in disguise , and without attendants . a little while before the time appointed for his friends coming . and was not a little surprised to see the door of his house broken open . he entered without making a noise ; but hearing some persons talking and making merry in the hall . he crept along by the side of the wall .
and just as [female] 's cruel blade was descending on her head . in rushed the brothers with their swords , -- they cut the murderer down . and saved their sister 's life , and gained much glory and renown . and then they all with gold and plate and jewels rare made free . and ever after lived content on [female] 's property .
all the skill of the household in their simple medicines was exhausted . and they stood looking on or moved about the lodge with whispered steps . awaiting the departure of the spirit , as one of the last acts of kindness . the skin door of the lodge had been thrown back to admit the fresh air of the evening . the poor man felt a momentary return of strength .
indeed by the situation of the stairs , he must be a good way from the tower itself . but those who work well in the depths more easily understand the heights , for indeed in their true nature they are one and the same . miners are in mountains ; and [male] . from knowing the ways of the king 's mines . and being able to calculate his whereabouts in them , was now able to find his way about the king 's house .
so all the young people were married in the golden temple of the sun . and all the earthquaker 's nurses who were under thirty were wedded to the young men who had been fond of them before they were sent into the hollow hill . these young men had never cared for any one else , everybody wore bridal favours . all the unengaged young ladies acted as bridesmaids , and such a throwing of rice and old shoes has very seldom been witnessed . as for the happy royal pair , with their fathers .
his breast swelled , he felt something so lofty . so holy , so elevated within him , yes , something so great and good . that he longed to create and chisel like forms from marble blocks . he desired to give expression to the feelings which agitated his heart . but how and in what shape ? the soft clay allowed itself to be modeled into beautiful figures by his fingers .
she now gave orders for a great hunt to be held . and intimated her wish that every one should attend , she herself was to be present in her chariot . and she proposed that every follower of the chase should choose a different line . and so close every avenue of escape to the quarry . the arrangements were carried out according to the queen 's plan .
when the animal saw ( for the bull had so much intelligence that it is really wonderful to think of ) . when he saw that [male] was no longer afraid of him . he grew overjoyed , and could hardly contain himself for delight . he frisked about the meadow , now here , now there , making sprightly leaps . with as little effort as a bird expends in hopping from twig to twig .
at that time [male] was in dire extremity . hence , when he heard these words he was greatly pleased . he begged the neighbor to act as a go between in the matter . so the latter visited the old beggar king and talked with him . and the beggar king talked over the matter with little golden daughter .
no little elf lay hidden there , and she turned sadly from them all . saying , i will go out into the fields and woods . and seek her there , i will not listen to this tiresome music more , nor wear this withered flower longer . so out into the fields she went , where the long grass rustled as she passed . and timid birds looked at her from their nests .
from below , unseen in the blackness of the deep night shadows . the water roared and boiled round the jagged rocks . he could picture the place as he knew it . only ten times more pitiless and forbidding in the visionless darkness . the wind soughed through the gorge with fearsome sighs .
seeing this , the bird grew restless , and craning its neck forward . seized the prince with its beak and placed him again between its wings . then it sprang upwards and soared swiftly into the sky . soon they were back in the cave , and the prince . dreading to return to the prison tower , spent the hours of daylight in his warm nest between the fire bird 's wings .
they are spent in play and amusement from morning till night . when night comes you go to bed . and recommence the same life in the morning , what do you think of it ? ', [male] ! said [male] , and he shook his head slightly . as much as to say , `` that is a life that i also would willingly lead . ''
far , far from here there once lived a king , who had three beautiful daughters . but he had no sons , and therefore he grew so fond of the three princesses that he granted their every wish . but in time the enemy invaded the country . and the king had to go to war , when he set out . the oldest princess begged him to buy her a ring that would prevent her dying as long as she wore it .
now it happened that a band of robbers had just broken into a castle near by and taken out a great lot of plunder . and they came under the very tree to divide it , and when they began to settle how much each should have they began to quarrel and woke up the farmer and his wife . they were so frightened when they heard the robbers underneath them that they tried to get up farther into the tree . and in doing so let the door fall down right on the robbers heads . the heavens are falling , cried the robbers , who were so frightened that they all rushed away , and the farmer and his wife came down from the tree and collected all the booty and went home and lived happy ever afterwards .
the nurse had taken all the pains imaginable to deck out her daughter . she put on her [female] 's prettiest frock . and covered her with diamonds from head to foot . but she was so ugly that nothing could make her look nice . and what was worse , she was sulky and ill tempered , and did nothing but [female] all the time .
his grandmother would have discouraged him , saying it was a long distance to the place where his father . ningabinn , or the west , lived , this information seemed rather to please than to discourage [male] . for by this time he had grown to such a size and strength that he had been compelled to leave the narrow shelter of his grandmother 's lodge and live out of doors . he was so tall that , if he had been so disposed , he could have snapped off the heads of the birds roosting on the topmost branches of the highest trees . as he stood up , without being at the trouble to climb , and if he had at any time taken a fancy to one of the same trees for a walking stick .
how wonderful the loneliness was up there , when he looked down there was an undulating floor of leaves . green and green and greener to a very blackness of greeniness . and when he looked up there were leaves again , green and less green and not green at all . up to a very snow and blindness of greeniness ; and above and below and around there was sway and motion . the whisper of leaf on leaf .
when i found myself thus hemmed in i felt that my last hour had come but i ran on till i came to some jungle . looking back from there i saw that the two bands had joined together and were coming after me . i did not feel safe there for i knew that there were bongas in the jungle who might tell the witches where i was . so i ran on to the tola where an uncle and aunt of mine lived . as i ran down the street i saw two witches at the back of one of the houses .
his life was a series of distracted compromises between the proprietor of the paper . who was a senile soap boiler with three ineradicable mistakes in his mind . and the very able staff he had collected to run the paper . some of whom were brilliant and experienced men and sincere enthusiasts for the political policy of the paper . a letter from one of these lay immediately before him .
so he bought for the two step daughters fine clothes . pearls , and jewels , and on his way back . as he rode through a green lane , a hazel twig struck against his hat . and he broke it off and carried it home with him . and when he reached home he gave to the step daughters what they had wished for .
in 1607 a witch of the name of [male] grierson was burnt after being accused and convicted of entering the house of [male] . in prestonpans , in the likeness of his own cat and in the company of a mighty rabble of other cats . which by their noise frightened [male] , his wife . and their maid , the last named being dragged up and down the stairs by the hair of her head . presumably by the devil in the shape of a black man .
on her death her story was forwarded to the capital . and his majesty was so much moved by it that he gave his sanction for an arch to be erected to her memory . in order that for ages to come the crowds passing daily under its shadow might read the record of her self sacrifice . and might learn how an admiring community had built this imperishable memorial of her wifely and motherly virtues . but of all the numerous arches spanning the road there was one which attracted more attention than any other in the long line .
s—mates and skippers always snoring great guns . and being dead sure to be hard at it if they had turned in and were asleep . hearing the double fire , down went the rangers into the skippers ', cabins . groped for the skippers inexpressibles , which it was the custom of those gentlemen to shake off . watch , money , braces , boots .
presently the full moon , which had been hiding behind a cloud , came out . and they saw their shadows , which fell straight before them . so they ran on hand in hand very merrily till the half moon came up . and the shadows she made them cast fell sideways . this was rather awkward , because as long as only the full moon gave them shadows .
`` oh , you wise woman , '' whispered [female] ( and [female] colored with satisfaction . because she was turned seventeen ) , `` what would poor men do without your help ? '' then he kissed very respectfully the hand that had pricked him . on the back and on the palm and on the four fingers and [male] and on the wrist . and then he began looking for a new place , but before he could make up his mind [male] had taken her hand and herself away .
and the more he ate the more he wanted , until he had eaten it all up . and he threw the bones under the table . then [female] went to her chest of drawers . and took one of her best handkerchiefs from the bottom drawer . and picked up all the bones from under the table and tied them up in her handkerchief .
his wife shortened the journey for him . she ran to meet him , and pulling the fish out of his hands . rushed off to the palace like a crazy woman , the king was waiting . and ran out the moment he saw her . when he looked at the fish he gave her two handfuls of gold .
however , the fact remained that strange things did happen there , and the king of sweden . to whom this part of the country belonged , more than once gave orders to cut down the haunted wood . but there was no one with courage enough to obey his commands . at length one man , bolder than the rest , struck his axe into a tree . but his blow was followed by a stream of blood and shrieks as of a human creature in pain .
breathless , he dashed through the doorway . fearing every minute that some one would notice the open gates and close them before he could enter . just in front of the giant turtle he fell in a little heap on the floor . which was covered inch deep with dust , his face was streaked , his clothes were a sight to behold . but [male] cared nothing for such trifles .
this tale has many variants in russian , and resembles the brünhilde and [female] story in the `` niebelungen lied . '' this story is remarkable for the change or metamorphosis of [male] . the great power , into a common [male] after his defeat by [male] tsarevich and the surrender of the feather staff . [male] is a great personage in [location] mythology . especially in that of the modocs , whenever he appeared and uttered his spell with an ominous laugh .
[male] tsarevich lay down and slept that minute ; he slept the day . slept the night , the bells rang for early prayers . the backyard grandmother ran to him . fell to beating him with whatever she found at hand . but could not rouse him , the morning prayers were over .
so they made haste , and all that night they journeyed beneath the moon . and all the next day they journeyed beneath the sun . and on the evening of the day they came to a city . and his soul answered him , it is not this city , but another . nevertheless let [location] enter in .
i wander through the halls , the halls where [female] lived . and kiss the lifeless walls that of her passage tell . it is not for the house that i with passion burn . but for the cherished ones that erst therein did dwell , may god be good to him who brought me news that they were come . for never more delightful news unto my ears were borne , if he would take a worn-out weds for boon .
upon this they despatched ambassadors into the enemy 's camp . and whilst these were protracting negotiations during the night , the thebans . with their wives and children , evacuated the city . next morning the argives entered thebes and plundered it . placing [male] , the son of polynices .
next day the [female] -- for it was a [female] as clear as day . asked if the old [male] would stay and keep house for him a few days . and as the day went on he took a great iron crowbar . and asked the lad if he had a mind to go with him up the hill and quarry a few corner stones . with all his heart , he said , and went with him .
aladdin was carried before the sultan , who waited for him . attended by the grand vizier ; and as soon as he saw him he ordered the executioner . who waited there for the purpose , to strike off his head without hearing him . or giving him leave to clear himself , as soon as the executioner had taken off the chain that was fastened about [male] 's neck and body . he made the supposed criminal kneel down , and tied a bandage over his eyes .
she would find the daughter of the sultan . she said , for if she was not here , she must be beyond the sea . so they made ready the great casket , put the old woman inside it . put food for nine days beside her . and cast it into the sea , the casket was tossed from wave to wave .
i should never have tired in examining and admiring so delightful a place ; nor have left it . had i not conceived a still higher idea of the other things which i had not seen . i went out at last with my mind filled with the wonders i had viewed . i shut the door , and opened the next , instead of an orchard . i found here a flower garden , which was no less extraordinary in its kind .
trap was friends with him directly . some people have no spirit -- but i hope i know my duty to myself too well for that . i snarled at the base intruder till he was quite ashamed of himself . i knew from the first that he would be taught jumping and begging , and things like that . i hate those things myself , but that 's no reason why every low dog should be taught them .
the mongoose boy could talk like any man but he never grew bigger than an ordinary mongoose and his name was [male] . one day the raja called all his sons to him and said that he wished . before he died , to divide his property among them . but the sons said that they had rather he did not do so then . they wished to go abroad and see the world , and if he would give each of them some capital to start .
a boat was sent to rescue me , and very soon i found myself on board surrounded by a wondering crowd of sailors and merchants eager to know by what chance i found myself in that desolate island . after i had told my story they regaled me with the choicest food the ship afforded . and the captain , seeing that i was in rags . generously bestowed upon me one of his own coats , after sailing about for some time and touching at many ports we came at last to the island of salahat . where [male] wood grows in great abundance .
so [female] took some of the bones lying about , and fashioned them into dice . and these he put into his pocket , then , bidding adieu to the headless corpse . he went on his way to play chaupur with the king . now , as raja [male] , tender hearted and strong , journeyed along to play chaupur with the king . he came to a burning forest .
and so the time came all too soon , when the child looked out alone . and when there was no face on the bed ; and when there was a little grave among the graves . not there before ; and when the star made long rays down towards him . as he saw it through his tears . now , these rays were so bright , and they seemed to make such a shining way from earth to heaven .
so spoke the toothless old woman , and the duchess . having comforted her with words and money , again took the road to the castle with her two children . one day , not long after this , [female] and [female] . without being seen , climbed up the stairs of the keep which rises in the middle of the castle . on reaching the platform they shouted loudly and clapped their hands .
all this time [male] and his brothers were looking about . in spite of the reproaches of the kind little [male] . but just as [male] was giving up his search , [male] , the youngest boy . trod on [male] 's tail . and gave him such a pang , that he could not help mewing most piteously .
once upon a time the youngest son of a king became filled with the desire to go abroad and see the world . he got his father 's permission to depart . kissed his parents good-bye , mounted his black horse , and galloped away down the high road . soon the gray towers of the old castle in which he was born hid themselves behind him . the prince journeyed on , spending the days in traveling .
and the little toad went and brought out a great chest , then they gave her food and drink . and led her to a beautifully made bed of silk and samite . on which she lay down and slept soundly , when the day dawned she arose . and the old toad gave her three things out of the huge chest to take with her . she would have need of them .
now we must go back to the king 's son after he had been put in charge of the nurse . one evening , after she had lit a candle and was holding the child . several planks sprang up in the floor of the room . and out at the opening came a beautiful woman dressed in white , with an iron belt round her waist . to which was fastened an iron chain that went down into the ground .
the dog ranks last in the list of regular flesh foods of the [male] man . in the benguet area it ranks second , pork receiving the first place . the ibilao does not eat dog -- his dog is a hunter and guard . giving alarm of the approaching enemy , in [male] the dog is eaten only on ceremonial occasions . funerals and marriages are probably more often celebrated by a dog feast than are any other of their ceremonials .
from several of my relatives -- and they without exception made use of the elixir when they received it on their twenty fifth birthday . i have heard many particulars concerning the [male] . but there was only one who ever said that he had been happier and more contented because of it . and that was my sainted father , the painter , [male] . he lost his father very early . and was brought up and educated in poverty and distress by his good mother who remained a widow .
although [female] 's mother wished nothing but ill to art . she yet treated him with the courtesy proper in a queen on the one hand and fitting towards the son of the king of [male] on the other . therefore , when art entered the palace he was met and kissed . and he was bathed and clothed and [organization] , two young girls came to him then . having a cup in each of their hands , and presented him with the kingly drink .
when they reached the bank the three friends consulted what they were to do in this fresh misfortune . as the otter was the only one who could swim it volunteered to look for the ring . so it plunged into the water and searched the bottom of the river in vain . then it guessed that a fish must have swallowed the ring and it set to work to catch every fish it saw and tore them open . at last in the stomach of a big fish it found the ring .
but still old duke [female] snored a drowsy hurricane . then little [male] sprang upon his knee . and seizing him by the head , pulled to move its dead weight . and finding he could not , struck him full on the mouth . crying , [male] , [male] , old [male] !
the next day he was forced to keep his bed . and his wife nursed him , and diamond attended to the baby . if he had not been ill , it would have been delightful to have him at home . and the first day diamond sang more songs than ever to the baby . and his father listened with some pleasure , but the next he could not bear even diamond 's sweet voice .
when she found a place where the berries grew thick and large . violet would call her mother to pick there ; and old [female] . [female] 's wife , said that `` somehow she never could find such splendid places as violet did . '' so , leaving her there , the little girl would move on ; and no matter how low she found the bushes . or how thinly covered with fruit , fairy contentment , hovering over her head .
then the family plans had to be discussed , the ex giant was very happy in his professorship . and talked enthusiastically of the courses that he was to give , and an annotated text book that he had been asked to edit . [male] and the family , after some intelligent discussion of this point . agreed with him , [male] was feeling quite at home with his new acquaintances by this time . the professor sat in a big [male] chair with the beauteous [male] on a cricket at his feet .
one may morning , as the children of [male] floated in the air around the island of inis glora . they heard a faint bell sounding across [location] . the mist lifted , and they saw afar off , beyond the waves . a vision of a stately white robed priest , with attendants around him on the irish shore . they knew that it must bepatrick , the tailkenn .
the sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves . but the clouds were tinted with [female] and gold . and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty . the sea was calm , and the air mild and fresh , a large ship . with three masts , lay becalmed on the water , with only one sail set .
the eldest princess had now reached her fifteenth birthday . and was to venture above the water , when she came back she had hundreds of things to tell them . but the most delightful of all , she said , was to lie in the moonlight . on a sandbank in a calm sea , and to gaze at the large town close to the shore . where the lights twinkled like hundreds of stars .
his godmother placed the little fellow gingerly on the table and next to him she put a drop of milk and beside it a crumb of bread . little [female] gulped the milk eagerly and ate nearly the whole crumb . when she placed near him a tiny bit of cloth for a pillow . [female] lay down and fell asleep , she watched the little fellow tenderly as he lay there so quietly and all worn out with his hard work . he was now a fullgrown lad , finely built and with black hair .
it is particularly painful to a woman , whenever her husband is unkind enough to say a lessening or harsh word of any member of her family . invectives against herself are not half so wounding , should illness , or suffering of any kind . assail your wife , your tenderness and attention are then peculiarly called for . and if she be a woman of sensibility . believe me , a look of love .
at that moment a hundred succulent chops which were saying `` eat me ! '' began to balance themselves in space , being neither stupid nor lazy , [female] tried to get hold of the nearest . but they all began a frantic career round the room . in the centre of the latter appeared a table covered with appetising eatables . but as soon as [male] went near they once more took to flight as if on invisible wings .
the dwarfs also have lenses of a diaphanous substance . unknown to men , these allow the eye to pierce through walls and rocks as if they were glass . others , more wonderful still , reproduce as faithfully as a mirror all that time has carried away in its course . for the dwarfs can recall , from the infinite vastness of the ether back into their cavern the light of former days together with the shapes and colours of vanished ages . they enjoy this view of the past by collecting the showers of light .
all these things were that the prince might have delight and beauty ever around him . to his eyes summer was perpetual , without end . and nothing died save to give out new life on the morrow . so through many morrows he lived , and trod the beautiful soft ways devised for him by cunning hands . and did not know that there was winter , or cold , or hunger to be borne in the world .
he looked forward with the greatest horror to dinner time . a feeling which had hitherto been as strange to him as to any other schoolboy . so it was now , however , for he knew he should have a terrible ordeal to go through . his father , having returned from another unsuccessful ride , would not only feel angry . but hurt , if his son made no inquiries as to whether any news had been heard of his sister .
between the towns of sion andmaurice the valley bends in the shape of an elbow . and belowmaurice it is so narrow that it hardly allows room for more than the river itself and a narrow road . an old tower stands here on the mountain side . as a sentry to mark the boundary of [organization] . opposite the stone bridge by the toll house .
but what made them mad beyond measure was the trick which the monster often played upon them by breaking the river banks . and the dykes which with great [person] they had built to protect their crops . then the waters overflowed all their farms , ruined their gardens and spoiled their cow houses and stables . this sort of mischief the afang liked to play . especially about the time when the oat and barley crops were ripe and ready to be gathered to make cakes and flummery .
well , the master shoemaker did as the fiddler said . and you may guess how the princess opened her pretty eyes when she heard that her sweetheart was thereabouts . nothing would suit her but that she must see that journeyman shoemaker . but when they sent to fetch him , he was gone . and now the shoemaker and the [female] began to talk again ; the princess had been promised to the man who saved her from the [female] .
but the pirates once safely out of the way , [male] and his friends went back to the rock to attack the captain . who was now single handed , a fierce fight ensued , [male] using his iron prong to some purpose on poor [male] . while the boys , seizing [male] 's boat . rowed off with [male] in it , at last , finding himself outdone . the captain gave up the fight , and in all haste swam back to his ship .
the harvest was stored in the barns , and a good harvest it was . there had been none such since the day that [male] had fared from lithend with [male] . and had returned to his ruin , one day , when [male] and [male] . [male] 's sons , had ridden away to holar to see their children . who were at nurse there , they heard strange tidings from some poor woman .
he gradually grew to regard its brilliance with a certain amount of suspicion . and more than once , when the [female] laid her head upon his shoulder . he felt as if a fiery eye shone guardian over her and watched unsleepingly his every movement . when in his vexation [male] allowed himself to speak harshly for the first time to his young wife . [male] tearfully deprecated his displeasure , she assured him her life was bound up in her talisman .
after tea more excitement , for there was mr. [male] and his company . who were in excellent form , `` oi , oi , oi , '' repeated that gentleman for the dozenth time . as he bobbed about aimlessly , in his anxiety to hit the clown and take the patient toby between his jointless arms . [female] dreamt that she was alone in a boat on a ruffled lake . on a white flag in the prow was a motto printed large .
and when he saw her brazen claws that still were greedy and lustful to strike and to slay . his face grew stern , and he paused no longer , but with his sword he smote her neck with all his might and main . and to the rocky floor the body of [female] fell with brazen clang . but her head he wrapped in the goatskin . while he turned his eyes away , aloft then he sprang .
his wife , she did the same , and between them they finished all the food there was . and so they went on , just as they were used to doing in beechtown . and it did not take the robbers long to find out the mistake they had made . the beetles had never done a day 's work in their lives . and they had no notion of beginning now , just because the robbers expected it .
frisk did as he was told , and as he knew of no better kitchen than the king 's . he went in softly , and when the cook 's back was turned took everything that was upon the spit . as it happened it was all done to a turn . and looked so good that it made him hungry only to see it . he carried his basket to the princess .
by and by the moon began to disappear behind a cloud , this was her polite way of saying that it was time for her to go to bed . because the sun was just getting up , the party was at an end . and soon over the top of the hill peeped the sun . very red in the face , ready to begin his day 's work . from gossamer and flowers bloom the fairies weave their dainty little handkerchiefs .
at about ten o'clock the same night , however , the ghostly shepherd flung himself at the young man . who drew a knife from his pocket and made five or six cuts at his adversary 's face . a few days later the shepherd came to the house and confessed that he was a sorcerer and had persecuted m. [male] . he had transported his double into the young man 's chamber . as well as the phantasmal doubles of his black dogs , the existence of the living phantom .
the white velvet curtains before the tall casements shut out the stars . but all the heavens seemed recorded by the glowing wax candles , down the center of the room ran the banquet table with dishes of gold . and plumage of rare birds nesting strange viands . and the sweet cheeks of summer fruits showing through the heaped blossoms of rose . [location] , and [person] , there were sweetmeats on dishes of pierced silver and between these played into broad glass bowls jets of scented water .
when our baby was two years old i used to sit of mornings . before going to my work , on the front steps , watching the baby playing on the sidewalk . this pleasantest half hour of the day i divided between the little one and my pipe . one morning , as i sat there smoking and as the little one was toddling to and fro on the sidewalk . a portly , nice looking old gentleman came down the street , and , as luck would have it .
anxiously the queen and princess awaited the king 's return . at last he came , untied the bag , and reached in for the horn , alas ! it had disappeared , and there in the distance came [male] and the rabbits . the king sent word for [male] to appear before the royal family . tell me about that horn of yours .
there were stalls on which lay all sorts of tempting things . cakes , sweet and toys . [female] felt sorry that she had no money . at the flower stall they paused ; the flowers were exquisitely arranged . and out of each peeped a little fee , as green ears asked boldly for engagement rings .
then [male] took leave of [male] and told him that if in two days he did not return . certain it would be that he would return no more , the hearts of all who said farewell to him were heavy . but [male] laughed , and bade them be of good cheer . then into the black waters he dived , sword in hand . clad in ring armour , and the dark pool closed over him as the river of death closes over the head of a man when his day is done .
a pound to set him up in life for ever . a pair of boots to take him to the coast of [location] . a hat to get him into a permanent situation under government . he has frequently been exactly seven and sixpence short of independence , he has had such openings at liverpool—posts of great trust and confidence in merchants houses , which nothing but seven and sixpence was wanting to him to secure—that i wonder he is not mayor of that flourishing town at the present moment .
the tailor felt a little afraid at first , and held back , but when he saw how merrily all was going . he plucked up his courage , and followed , the circle closed again directly . and the little folks went on singing and dancing with the wildest leaps . the old man , however , took a large knife which hung to his girdle . whetted it , and when it was sufficiently sharpened , he looked round at the strangers .
at that [female] the rash would have struck them . but [male] held him back , till one of the merchant kings spoke to them . a tall and stately man , so they went up across the square . and wondered still more as they went ; for along the quays lay in order great cables . and yards , and masts , before the fair temple of [male] .
the dervish took the box i had extended to him . and , bidding me shut my left eye , touched it gently with the ointment . when i opened it again i saw spread out . as it were before me , treasures of every kind and without number . but as all this time i had been obliged to keep my right eye closed .
what a [male] of delight arose ! king [male] embraced his wife and daughter . the duchess clung to [female] in a spasm of joy . prince [male] and his brother wept in each other 's arms . while prince [male] 's fifty sailors all crowded around them .
as we approach a period that our older contemporaries can remember . it is very interesting to turn over the leaves of the back numbers of such magazines and newspapers as treated of the industrial arts . the art union , which changed its title to the art journal in 1849 . had then been in existence for about ten years , and had done good work in promoting the encouragement of art and manufactures . the `` society of arts '' had been formed in [location] as long ago as 1756 .
so [male] was left alone with the dead hen , and he dug a grave himself and laid her in it . then he made a mound over it . and seated himself upon it and grieved till he died . and then they were all dead , there was once a man who had three sons . the youngest of them was called simpleton ; he was scorned and despised by the others .
among the mountains of carmarthen , lies a beautiful and romantic piece of water . named the van pools , tradition relates . that after midnight , on new tear 's [female] . there appears on this lake a being named the spirit of the van . she is dressed in a white robe , bound by a golden girdle .
they lay down that night , and if it was early that [female] rose . it was earlier than that that the queen was on foot making ready . he got the brown horse and his sack full of gold and silver and stones of great price . and then [male] and his three sons went away , and they returned home to the erin realm of gladness . he left the gold and silver in his house .
the mother let him in , and he gave her the gold pieces . and , `` wait now , '' says he , `` till you hear the music i will play . '' he buckled on the pipes , but instead of music . there came a sound as if all the geese and ganders in [male] were screeching together . he wakened the neighbours , and they were all mocking him .
when the queen was absent , one day , the men took the boat and compelled [female] to leave the island with them . but the queen rode after them and flung a rope . which [male] caught and which clung to his hand . she drew them back to the shore . this happened thrice , and the men accused [male] of catching the rope on purpose .
in the third place i am of opinion that another consequence of the false light in which `` falling in love , '' and what it leads to , are viewed in our society , is that the birth of children has lost its pristine significance . and that modern marriages are conceived less and less from the point of view of the family . i am of opinion that this is not right , this is my third [person] . fashionable dress today , the course of reading .
as soon as the formal invitation has been sent the people of the community giving the feast begin to bring in the yams from the gardens . which they do day by day . singing as they do so ; and these yams are stored away in the houses as they are brought in . when the yams have all been collected , they are brought out and spread in one . two , or three long lines along the centre of the village open space .
as soon as they had cast anchor and hauled down the sail . the negroes went into the hold and brought up a long rope ladder . heavily weighted with lead , the master of the galley threw it over the side . making the ends fast to two iron stanchions . then the negroes seized the youngest of the slaves and knocked his gyves off .
at last the company targets were decided , and [male] . as was expected , led the score , having made six exact centers in succession . [male] of the white hand followed with five , and [male] with four . two other captains had touched their center four times . but not roundly , while in the other companies it so chanced that the captains had been out shot by some of the men under them .
so for yet another week the king 's nose was kept to the grindstone . and it would have irritated most men to find their good work repeatedly condemned . but [male] was , as you may have observed , singularly sweet tempered , besides which he desired nothing so much as to remain where he was . and for another five days he slept and ate and worked . until the muscles of his arms began to swell , and he swung the hammer with as much ease as his master .
α , a man is enticed into their abode . where he unites with a woman of the underground race . now , there is scarcely a collection of folk lore which does not contain a story founded on this root . it appears in every branch of the aryan family . and examples might be quoted from modern greek , albanian , neapolitan , french , german , danish .
in this car the root king seated himself with the princess . nor was it forgotten to place in it also a delicate repast of juicy berries . honey , and tender young buds . two cranes , who had practised their task for a week previously . took up the nest with their bills , and flew with it through the air to the nearest large town inhabited by men .
when they of the table round heard sir [male] say so . the most part of them arose , and made such avows as sir [male] had made . anon as king [male] heard this he was greatly grieved . for he wist well that they might not gainsay their avows . and he should be bereft of the fairest fellowship and the truest knighthood that ever were seen together in any realm of the world .
he stamped his feet , he tore his hair . he swore at her , and i believe , he even struck her . but when the next child was born , -- a particularly wonderful one , -- mrs. [female] had not the strength to resist the temptation of knowing how the new born wonder would impress the countess [female] markenstein . another terrible scene followed , the poor woman could never understand that she was no longer the wife of a waiter . and that she must not be paying visits to the great folks in their kitchens .
then , if anybody was glad , it was the two elder brothers . `` here is something to stay our stomachs , '' said they . but the two elder brothers were deaf in that ear . they had gone without their dinners long enough , and they were no such foolish fellows as to throw it away . now that it had come to them , but [male] begged and begged .
sometimes he will make the pot boil over and put out the fire . then again he will make it impossible for the pot to boil at all . he will steal the bacon flitch , or empty the potato kish , or fling the baby down on the floor . or occasionally will throw the few poor articles of furniture about the room with a strength and vigor altogether disproportioned to his diminutive size . but his mischievous pranks seldom go further than to drink up all the milk or despoil the proprietor 's bottle of its poteen .
the human octopus tightened his cruel grip . [male] 's head fell back , her golden hair streamed over her shoulders . her eyes distended , and she could not get her breath . delighted beyond measure were all the brownies with prince [male] 's most amazing feat . and their pleasure manifested itself in broad smiles upon smug faces .
so the next morning when they were leading the man to be hanged to the gallows made of lumber and the rope made of hemp . where they were going to hoist him high because he sneezed in the wrong place before the wrong people . he used his fingers winding up the watch and pushing on the stem winder . there was a snapping and a slatching like a gas engine slipping into a big pair of dragon fly wings . the dollar watch changed into a dragon fly ship .
they flew a long distance , until they reached a great forest . when they had come to the middle of it . down flew the fairy , and in a minute more the young prince was standing on the green grass beside a beautiful pink marble palace that looked something like a good-sized summer house . this is your home , said the godmother , in it you will find everything you need . and you can do just as you choose with your time .
the crowd pressed around her to destroy her work . but just then eleven white swans flew down and perched upon the cart flapping their wings . the crowd gave way before them in terror . it is a sign from heaven ! she is innocent , they whispered , but they dared not say it aloud .
disguising himself as a merchant , [male] obtained an introduction to the royal palace . where he offered to the king 's daughters various trinkets for sale . the girls , with one exception , all examined his wares with unfeigned interest . observing this circumstance [male] shrewdly concluded that the one who held aloof must be none other than the young [male] himself . but in order further to test the correctness of his deduction .
oft times a party of gentlemen have sent for me in the summer . having arranged with me to bring four or five ferrets and ratting appliances . and we have gone 50 miles up the country . they would bring their terrier dogs , and we would hunt all along the brooks and rivers . and round the corn and wheat fields .
at the end of four months he reached marseilles . resolved to embark for the indies , at the sight of the raging sea . however , his brave and faithful servants were seized with an epidemic . called by the physicians stay at homeativeness in hebrew , and the headache in the feet in latin . to the great regret of these honest people , they were forced to quit their good master and remain quietly on shore .
even while he was speaking , an old man came in , clothed all in white . and none of the knights knew who he was or where he came from . with him was a young knight in red armor . without sword or shield ; but an empty scabbard hung by his side . when the old man departed twenty squires met him .
the stone of patience has a yellow colour , and the knife of patience has a brown handle . bring them both to me , said the damsel . so the bey went on his way , and got the negress her garment . but the stone of patience and the knife of patience he could find nowhere . what was he to do ? -- he could not return home without the gifts .
so it was , on the seventh day of the seventh moon came the magpies from far and near . and they spread their wings for a frail bridge . and the weaving [female] went over by the frail bridge . her eyes were like stars , and her heart like a bird in her bosom . and the herd boy was there to meet her upon the farther shore .
primordial elephants loomed by your side , and our clay painted children danced by your path . chanting the death of the kingdoms of wrath . you wrought until night with [location] all . the fierce brutes fawned at your call , then slipped to their lairs , song chained . and thus you sang sweetly , and reigned : immortal is the inner peace .
just as the lad got to where the apple tree stood he looked over his shoulder . and there he saw the grey master coming over the hills . the lad did as he was told , and the apple tree drooped its branches about him . until one could see neither hide nor hair of him , no , the apple tree had seen nobody go past that place . so back went the master home again to have another look into his book of knowledge .
The Light Princess & Other Fairy Tales by [male] at [organization] once upon a time . so long ago that i have quite forgotten the date , there lived a king and queen who had no children . and the king said to himself , all the queens of my acquaintance have children . some three , some seven , and some as many as twelve ; and my queen has not one . i feel ill used , so he made up his mind to be cross with his wife about it .
not a very long time passed away , and then this thing befell the tsarevich [male] . the other son of [male] the soldier . there was once upon a time an old man and an old woman . the old woman was not a bad old woman , but there was this one bad thing about her . she did not know how to hold her tongue , whatever she might hear from her husband .
it happened one day that i passed a tree under which lay several dry gourds . and catching one up i amused myself with scooping out its contents and pressing into it the juice of several bunches of grapes which hung from every bush . when it was full i left it propped in the fork of a tree . and a few days later , carrying the hateful old man that way . i snatched at my gourd as i passed it and had the satisfaction of a draught of excellent wine so good and refreshing that i even forgot my detestable burden .
mr.

she had to stay at court now ; she had her own cage . and permission to walk out twice in the day and once at night . she was given twelve servants , who each held a silken string which was fastened round her leg . there was little pleasure in flying about like this , the whole town was talking about the wonderful bird . and when two people met each other one would say `` nightin , '' and the other `` gale , ''
as she could not see him , either in the stables . or the walk lined with fig trees trained upon espaliers beside the house . she turned quickly away , repressing out of pride her desire to call him . on her way to the sea she met her uncle 's high shouldered slave . [male] stopped and questioned him , [male] had told no lie .
he had been plying his trade for some time . and had earned some little reputation , when [male] reached the city and began his search for him . but the days and months passed away , and , after a year 's fruitless seeking . [male] , who had spent all his money without obtaining a clue to the whereabouts of his enemy . was sorely perplexed , and was driven to live by his wits as a fortune teller .

thus , by daily repeating these deceptions , he impressed on the inhabitants so great an idea of his sanctity that he was universally revered . and , when he passed , the people of ujjayini reverentially bowed and [male] before him . exclaiming , `` this is , indeed , a holy man , '' meanwhile , his friend [male] had . through his spies , received intelligence of all these doings . and now , magnificently dressed like a rajput he also entered the city .
mine are no new views of the noble savage . the greatest writers on natural history found him out long ago . [male] knew what he was , and showed why he is the sulky tyrant that he is to his women . and how it happens that his race is spare in numbers . for evidence of the quality of his moral nature .
and the mill began to grind salt so that it poured out like water . and when the skipper had got the ship full he wished to stop the mill . but whichever way he turned it . and however much he tried , it did no good . the mill kept on grinding , and the heap of salt grew higher and higher .
it came from the next apartment -- the sound of a woman weeping . he listened , and in the stillness of the palace the sound came clearly . he knew that voice : it was the voice of his dear princess [female] . just as he used to hear it when , as a blue bird . he spoke with her at her window .
then the spirit touched may 's eyes , and looking down she saw the little path by which she had come grow wider and smoother . till it wound round and round the mountain like a broad white ribbon . and up this pleasant path came many people , some were pale and sad ; some [female] , some ill . some were children in their mothers arms ; some old and bent . but were climbing eagerly up toward the fairy spring , -- sure of help and health when they arrived .
when the baker returned he flew into a terrible rage . he gave poor [female] a beating and turned her out into the street . she walked about the city and at last found work as shopkeeper in a little shop on a corner . the owner of the business went away next day . leaving her in charge of everything , as soon as he was gone she shut the door and all the windows .
my [female] , answered the lad -- 'the princess that was under the spell and is now free . by this the irishman knew that she had sent the lad to wait on him . the lad also told him that his [male] wished him to be ready next morning at nine o'clock . when she would come for him with the carriage . as she had promised , he was greatly pleased at this , and next morning .
it was now too late for the one of them , but she peeled the other and then ate it too . in due time it happened as the woman had said . but the first that the queen gave birth to was a hideous [female] , or serpent . no one saw this but her waiting woman , who threw it out of the window into the forest beside the castle . the next that came into the world was the most beautiful little prince , and he was shown to the king and queen .
[male] realized this when he saw [female] hold her dead baby in her arms and smile through her tears . and yet this was her `` little [female] '' that she loved with such an intense delight and devotion . because in him , all the day long , she saw that wonderful life of god manifested in such a heavenly innocence and purity . as in a tiny image of her own [female] , yet , when the spirit of the child was gone . she adorned the clay form in which it had dwelt .
when the prince heard that he drove her away at once . for he was in an awful rage ; and then he asked the stone how it all was with these princesses who had stepped on it . for he could not understand it at all , he said . so the stone told him how they had cheated him . and sent little [male] the goose girl to him in their stead .
the sun shone most brightly ; and the sound of the great unknown bell was heard more distinctly than ever . they had a mind to go thither , all except three , one of them wished to go home and try on her ball dress . for this very dress and the ball were the cause of her being confirmed this time . otherwise she would not have been allowed to go , the second , a poor boy . had borrowed a coat and a pair of boots from the son of his landlord to be confirmed in .
the most popular work in the later dynasties was that which has been called the book of the dead by modern writers . we must not conceive { 77 } of it as a bound up whole . like our bible ; but rather as an incongruous accumulation of charms and formulae . parts of which were taken at discretion by various scribes according to local or individual tastes . no single papyrus contains even the greater part of it .
so pleased was [female] with this horrid plot . that he could have danced for joy , that very night . the magician filled [male] 's flask with the poisonous water . and departed , thinking that nobody had noticed him , the yellow bird . however , had seen everything , and followed the magician to note where he hid the real water of healing .
[male] had become quite a celebrity , and great ladies . leaders of society , found him so interesting and touching . that they all cried out as he passed by , oh , do come to dinner at our house . do come in the kennel , all the newspapers had asked him to write the cricket and football news for them . and his picture postcards were to be seen in every shop window .
you failed again today , said she -- failed just at the very moment when you were about to step on the [location] of erin . i can give you only one chance more . it will be your last , the queen will go hunting in the morning . join the hunt , and when you are separated from the rest of the party in the wood throw your reins upon your horse 's neck and he will lead you to the edge of the lake .
by this time the fame of princess [male] 's beauty had reached the ears of the emperor . and he sent one of the court ladies to see if she were really as lovely as report said . if so he would summon her to the palace and make her one of the ladies in waiting . when the court lady arrived , in spite of her father 's entreaties . princess [female] refused to see her .
he was a stranger , they had never seen him before . the [male] played upon his shining limbs like fire . his eyes were bright and piercing , and above his forehead waved a plume of gorgeous feathers . for a moment he stood looking in upon them . then he laid a deer down upon the threshold .
she scolded all day long from morning until night . and she was never wrong and he was never right , oh , she could bake and bile . and she could clean and mend , but since she scolded all the while . he left her in the end . by the end of the third verse the queen was looking very strained and anxious .
with these remarks , the aged hag set off at a pace . which , considering her years , was truly wonderful , putting the prince to his best endeavors to keep up with her . the underground avenue in which they ran seemed of great length . and very shortly the old lady varied the exercise by introducing certain gymnastics . sometimes , as she stretched out her staff , the ground would suddenly open before her .
at night , when they were at supper together . they all agreed to travel for a year , and to meet at that inn . and that the first that came should wait for the rest ; that , as they had all three taken their leave together of the sultan . they might all return together , the next morning by break of day . after they had embraced and wished each other good success , they mounted their horses and took each a different road .
[male] was too old to change his mode of life . he would not hear of going to live in town , although they had money sufficient for that purpose . he also still continued the making of wooden shoes . those which rose wore in winter were trimmed with lamb's wool , which she wrought very dexterously . she was clever and ingenious but , it must be confessed .
he lives in the pantry or in the barn . at night he washes the dishes and sweeps the kitchen floor . or threshes the farmer 's corn and looks after his sheep . oh , the tomt is a very friendly elf , but his feelings are easily hurt ! and if any one is impolite to him , he runs away , and is never seen again .
plate 71 shows a little girl upon whom the perineal band ceremony has just been performed . she has a string of dogs teeth over her forehead , and a belt of dogs teeth round her waist , an enormous crescent shell ornament . some long pigtails , and on her head is the feather ornament .
rich tapestries hung about the walls , they presented certain stories from mythology in the form of pictures traced in golden threads . there were golden candlesticks , and even the chairs and tables were of gold . at the far side of the room , which was very large , there appeared to be a sort of alcove before which a damask curtain was closely drawn . before this curtain sat a lady of honor . she seemed a very great person indeed , her dress being inferior only to that of a queen in richness and elegance .
his frock coat , made of good west of england broadcloth . had , in consequence of many years wear , become a dark blood colour . in his hat were placed two rows of feathers . arranged in the form of the prince of wales ', plume . he was certainly a most singular looking figure , and from the hour when he commenced to expatiate on the virtues of his wares until the dusk of the evening .
there are very few husbands so bad as to be destitute of good qualities . and probably , very decided ones , let the wife search out and accustom herself to dwell on those good qualities . and let her treat her own errors , not her husband's , with severity . i have seldom known a dispute between man and wife in which faults on both sides were not conspicuous . and really it is no wonder ; for we are so quick sighted to the imperfections of others .
the paharias had a discussion as to who should sleep on the bed and in order to avoid any ill feeling about it they decided that they would all sleep on the ground and put their feet on the bed and then they could feel that they had all an equal share of it . this they did and in the morning the [male] raja came in and found them all lying in this strange position and was very much amused . he explained that he had sent the bed for the use of the chief man among them and asked whether they had no distinctions of rank , `` yes '' they said we have in our own villages . but here we are in a foreign land and as we do not all belong to one village who is to decide which is the chief among us .
the lord mayor himself went to the largest shop in [male] and in the name of the children of [male] purchased a royal lion doll . nearly as big as a real baby lion , with a patent voice inside which made it cry `` gr r ! gr r , '' when you twisted its luxuriant tail , and this was to be the toy of the little princess hope . with this wonderful toy under one arm and a basket under the other . which contained among other things a green and gold volume from the library .
they quickly saw the dead serpent and the young prince standing over it . and the old mother [organization] said to him . `` dear boy , for many '' years all our young ones have been devoured by that cruel serpent . you have now saved the lives of our children . whenever you are in need therefore , send to [location] and we will help you .
but it was no use , neither words nor blows would get the secret out of the boy . and when her arm was quite tired and she had to leave off , the child . sore and aching , ran into the garden and knelt weeping beside his little sword . it was working round and round in its hole all by itself . and if anyone except the boy had tried to catch hold of it .
dobrunka remained the sole [female] of the house . the cow , and the garden , to say nothing of a piece of meadow adjoining the house . but when a good and pretty girl has a field under her window . the next thing that follows is a young farmer , who offers her his heart and hand . [male] was soon married , the twelve months did not abandon their child .
the woodman , however , was not to be moved , his wife , he was sure . would not like such a guest , and who could say what he might take it into his head to do ? besides , he should lose his dog and his cat . his ducks and his geese ; for they would all run away for fright . whether the bear was disposed to be friends with them or not .
[person] sat on deck , and saw the sand hills gradually appearing in the distance . the church and lighthouse looked like a heron and a swan rising from the blue waters . if the wind held good they might reach home in about an hour . so near they were to home and all its joys . so near to death and all its terrors , a plank in the ship gave way .
by the time she was ready to undress the sun was quite gone . and the shoes she took off were common ones again . for midsummer day was over , but [female] never forgot the little lessons she had learned . she tried to run willingly when spoken to ; she remembered the pretty steps and danced like a fairy . and best of all , she always loved the innocent and interesting little creatures in the woods and fields .
she could not be mistaken ; so closely were his features engraved on her memory . yes , and , it may be , on her heart , she slipped the bracelet on her wrist . without stopping to think that it did not belong to her , and went on to explore further . she passed into a long picture gallery . and there again she met the prince's face .
miss [female] had never seen any young men except when they came to dine on sir [male] 's invitation . and his manner on those occasions so awed them that they always sat on the edge of their chairs . and said , `` no , thank you , '' when the baron said . have some more capon ? then the baron would snort , nonsense ! [male] . bring me master [male] 's plate ,
at the close of his third day , the squire 's son found himself at the gates of a noble city built of cedar green glass on an open hill in the heart of the wildwood . now as it was late in the day when the youth arrived at the city . it came to pass that he went to an inn for supper and the night . the [male] of the tavern , i must tell you . was a lonely orphan [female] named [female] , surely there was never a [female] or a kinder little maid !
she felt curiously calm , and very wide awake , there was not the very slightest sound to be heard . a complete contrast to the surrounding forest -- not a rustle , not a [female] . never had [female] before realised what utter silence could be , she almost felt as if she herself should not move a finger . scarcely even breathe , and when in a little she became conscious that her heart was again beating much faster than its wont . she felt as if she must press it tightly to make it be quiet .
by and by the farmer and his men came up , and found the fool eating the plums . with the goose on the grass beside him . they hurried him off to the justice . where his own story met with no credit , the woman of the next farm came up also . and recognized him for the man who had begged at her door the day she lost a [female] and two new loaves .
one moment he sat silent and gazed into the mist . with an unutterably weary expression , then he began to talk to his companion . then the other one took out some bread and cheese from his knapsack . to eat his evening meal , he answered scarcely anything . but listened very patiently , just as if he were thinking : `` i might as well give you the pleasure of letting you chatter a while . ''
so all came again into the other room , and [male] was made sit down . and everybody drank his health , and he drank everybody 's health at one offer . and six stout fellows saw himself and the master home . and waited in the parlour while he went up and brought down the two hundred guineas . and double wages for [male] himself .
thus did the unkind step mother humble herself and ask forgiveness of the girl she had so wronged . such was the sweetness of the girl 's disposition that she willingly forgave her step mother . and never bore a moment 's resentment or malice towards her afterwards . the father saw by his wife 's face that she was truly sorry for the past . and was greatly relieved to see the terrible misunderstanding wiped out of remembrance by both the wrong doer and the wronged .
he met with some difficulty in finding his way out of the house . but , at last , he reached the road in safety . he easily found his way to the beanstalk and descended it better and quicker than he had expected . his mother was overjoyed to see him , he found her crying bitterly . and lamenting his hard fate , for she concluded he had come to some shocking end through his rashness .
[female] told him that he had come down to see him . when he did , without knowing how ill he was . he had had a letter from him . at his store up in rosebery last month . and for old sakes sake he had driven down when he had a chance to come away .
her visitor was not discouraged , he called to her again , and told her that he was flying soot . finding that she still made no reply . he assured her that he was a friend . and began at once to give her what news he could of king red flame and the princess . at that the earth fairy answered him willingly .
such is the description of the two daughters of the noble house of [female] . as given by a pigmy writer of eminence at that time . and such were the charms against which king [male] had to contend at the beginning of the campaign . the prime minister had intended that his entertainment should take the shape of a banquet . but the ladies insisted upon a ball , and a ball it was consequently to be .
in 1580 , the youngest son of lord doune [female] ( as the name was generally spelt after queen [male] 's return ) . received from [male] , the ward and marriage of the two daughters of the regent moray . and a few days thereafter he married the elder . lady [male] , and assumed the title of the [male] of moray . as this claim to the earldom was doubtful , a charter was given to him in 1592 .
the voice of nature , however , cries aloud in behalf of [male] . my infant son , it is for him that i wish to utter a few plaintive household words . i am not at all angry ; i am mild—but miserable , i wish to know why . when my child , [male] , was expected in our circle . a provision of pins was made , as if the little stranger were a criminal who was to be put to the torture immediately .
but even while he was so thinking he heard fierce and angry snortings . and , coming swiftly from the island to the shore , he saw the swimming and prancing steeds . sometimes their heads and manes only were visible , and sometimes , rearing , they rose half out of the water . and , striking it with their hoofs , churned it into foam . and tossed the white spray to the skies , as they approached nearer and nearer their snortings became more terrible .
[female] was very much troubled at this , he feared there was some enchantment about the place that made him visible in spite of his cap of darkness . however , none of the other animals paid any attention to him . so he hoped it was only the doe that could see him . [male] raised the horn to his lips and blew a blast so loud and clear that the castle echoed with it . at once a wonderful change came over the garden , the doe beside him changed into a [male] more beautiful than any [male] had ever dreamed of .
she started to climb through the window , and saw that it was raining very hard . a steady downpour that promised to last all day , she returned to the chest . laid the note carefully aside , and again lifted out and unfolded each garment , how beautiful they were ! time had given them the delicate . mellow tint of old ivory , dolores dearly enjoyed pretty clothes .
but the horse guessed this new danger and told the princess how to escape it . but it is one thing to receive advice when we feel safe and comfortable . and quite another to be able to carry it out when some awful peril is threatening us . and if the wolf had made the girl quake with terror . it seemed like a lamb beside this dreadful lion .
so they all set off to the wood together , and built a house . the pig hewed the timber , and the sheep drew it home . the [person] was carpenter , and gnawed pegs and bolts and hammered them into the walls and roof . the goose plucked moss and stuffed it into the seams . the cock crew , and looked out that they did not oversleep themselves in the morning .
she followed , he made straight for the boat . clambered into it , and held out his hand to help her in , then he caught up the little boat hook . and pushed away from the shore : there was a great white flower floating a few yards off . and that was the little fellow 's goal , but , alas , no sooner had [female] caught sight of it . huge and glowing as a harvest moon , than she felt a great desire to have it herself .
it was difficult for him to grasp the idea that the fresh . green pines could burn , if it really were the forest that was burning , perhaps the fire might spread all the way over to him . it seemed improbable ; but he wished the eagle would soon return . it would be best to be away from this , the mere smell of the smoke which he drew in with every breath was a torture . all at once he heard a terrible crackling and sputtering .
when he was tired of walking , a mother bear carried him on her back . her cubs ran to greet him , and romped and wrestled with him . sometimes [male] would climb up the smooth barked monkey tree , and sit on the topmost bough . and laugh at the vain efforts of his shaggy cub friends to follow him . then came the bears supper time , and the feast of golden liquid honey !
why did she go about at night ? why did she appear only now and then . and on such occasions ? one went on to tell how one night when his grandfather had been having a jolly time of it with his friends in the market town . she had served him so upon his way home that the poor man never drank a drop of anything stronger than water after it to the day of his death . she dragged him into a bog . and tumbled him up and down in it till he was nearly dead .
`` oh , you darling , '' sang the blackbird ; and golden hair laughed with glee . for she liked to be loved , as to the butterflies , they flew after her . and rested on her hair , and tickled her cheeks . but she never tried to catch them , then golden hair went upstairs . and there she saw three beds all in a row .
`` she is already here , '' said the enchanter , and he touched [male] with his wand . immediately there was a flash of flame , and out of it . [female] no longer , but her own self , appeared [female] . her hair had grown long again , and the enchanter had clad her in the most magnificent of gowns . never was there a lovelier girl to be seen on earth , you may be sure that the prince stepped forward .
now , the king 's swineherd was in want of a lad . and as there was nothing better to do in that town . [male] took the place and went every morning to help drive the pigs into the forest . where they might eat the acorns and grow fat . one day there was a mighty stir throughout the town .
king [male] lost no time in marrying his dear and lovely [male] . and his joy was complete when the good queen appeared at his wedding . she assured him that the fairy of the mountain had henceforth lost all power over him . and after spending some time with the young couple , and bestowing the most costly presents on them . she retired to her own country , king [male] insisted on his brother sharing his throne .
each country possesses certain stories which have special reference to its own manners and customs . and by collecting such tales as these , something approximating to a picture of its national life may be laboriously pieced together . but the stories of this class are often nothing more than comparatively modern adaptations of old and foreign themes . nor are they sufficiently numerous , so far as we can judge from existing collections . to render by any means complete the national portrait for which they are expected to supply the materials .
the poor little babies had found no rest even in their graves , in the place where they had been buried there sprang up two beautiful young aspens . and the stepmother , who hated the sight of the trees . which reminded her of her crime , gave orders that they should be uprooted . but the emperor heard of it , and forbade the trees to be touched . saying , let them alone ; i like to see them there !
`` sometimes , '' he replied , `` when they are very young -- 'children , '' the mortals call them -- i have stopped to rescue them from [male] . the men and women i dare not interfere with ; they must bear the burdens nature has imposed upon them . but the [male] infants , the innocent children of men . have a right to be happy until they become full grown and able to bear the trials of humanity .
loki made himself busy putting more and more logs on the fire . at last he called to [male] , and the father of the gods came and sat down near the fire to eat the meal . but when the meat was taken off the cooking spits and when [male] went to cut it . he found that it was still raw , he smiled at [male] for thinking the meat was cooked . and [male] , troubled that he had made a mistake .
to [male] , the valiant knight , he gave a coat of mail . that did the rich king honour , albeit he seldom took gifts . he bowed before [male] and thanked him . [male] offered [male] a fair gift . as was fitting , since the king had taken one , that he might not fare to the hightide without a keepsake from her .
it took much urging for the young man to gain permission from her to relate his story . but , when she had once heard it , everything sounded so logical that she decided to receive him as her brother . she asked how he had ever found her home . and how he had come through the thicket which surrounded her palace . the young man told her about his magic boot .
presently the portals were once more swept apart , revealing [male] and his followers . not a sound rose from the assembly , growling for rage beneath a huge pair of dragoon 's [male] . the wicked marquis made his way to the dais and the coronation chair . the noise of bells and cannon ceased . an official in blue advanced with the royal robe .
once upon a time there was a young man of the weaver caste , named [male] . he was an orphan and lived all alone , one summer he planted a field of pumpkins on the sandy bed of a river . the plants grew well and bore plenty of fruit . but when the pumpkins were ripe , a jackal found them out and went every night and feasted on them . [male] soon found out from the foot marks who was doing the damage .
their happiness seemed complete , when a sudden sense of horror struck them both at the same moment . and hardly had they realised it when they noticed something very large which had been poised above swooping towards them . striking terror into their souls as it came . it was a sparrow hawk , and death was upon them . instinctively they swerved out of its terrible course , and commenced a series of short .
the men of icefirth were wont to drive their sheep into the mountains during the summer . leave them there till autumn , and then , collecting the scattered flocks . to restore to each man his own branded sheep , one autumn the flocks were wild and shy . and it was found that many sheep had strayed in the hills . when those that had been gathered were divided [male] had lost at least sixty wethers .
it was bright day and the office was but a few hundred yards from the house . all the same , as they walked along , she was glad to hear a sharp metallic clicking a little distance behind them . and turning her head , to see [male] ambling along with his clumsy . bow legged gait , dragging a lawn mower , little [male] was this poor oaf with the scars of his master 's whip upon him . but [male] had seen a doglike devotion light up the dull eyes in those few minutes up in her room .
it was , indeed , a wondrous land which stretched far and wide before him in fresh and fragrant beauty . it was his native land shining in unimagined splendour . [male] lakes gleamed in the distance . and the snow crowned mountain peaks glowed in the morning sunlight like the roses in king [male] 's magic garden . but there was no palace here , no lovely [female] among her flowers .
presently as she stood [female] in the dark . wondering if help would come , she heard something calling in the distance . calling , calling , and then dying away with a sob , till the marshes were full of this pitiful crying sound . then she heard steps floundering along , squishing in the mud and slipping on the tufts . and through the darkness she saw a white face with great feared eyes .
`` my own weight in gold , '' cried the rat catcher . in a frenzy ; but the gnome would not close the bargain till he had wrung from the rat catcher the promise of his last penny . so the gnome carried away all the sacks of gold before the rat catcher 's eyes . and when he had them safe underground . then at last he let the old man go , then he called [male]
though the widening battle of millions and millions of men threatens to night to [female] the whole of the earth . back of the smoke is the promise of kindness again . [male] is plowing yet , when the smoke clouds break , high in the sky shines a field as wide as the world . there he toils for the kingdom of heaven 's sake . ah , he is taller than clouds of the little earth .
their married life ran smoothly , and to them a babe was born . but [female] oft wonder would if her fairy friend was gone . one day while at her wigwam door , the baby in her arms . the earth began to tremble and it filled her with alarms . then she saw her old fish monster swimming gracefully along .
it happens that i met him with some frequency in my university days and afterwards ever and again i came upon him . he was rather a brilliant man at the university . smart without being vulgar and clever for all that , he was remarkably good-looking from the very onset of his manhood and without being in any way a showy [organization] . was quite magnificently extravagant , there was trouble in his last year , something hushed up about a girl or woman in [location] . but his family had it all over with him .
she was taken to the princess , who saluted her and treated her with great honor . at night the princess said good-bye to her father . and set out on the carpet for [male] 's palace . with his mother at her side , and followed by the hundred slaves . she was charmed at the sight of [female] .
the following day he again went to the forest . and herded his hares ; but while he lay in all comfort beside a [male] . they sent out the chamber maid from the castle to him . and she was to find out how he managed to herd the king 's hares . he showed her his whistle .
the cloth being taken away , [male] wishing to go out . watched his time when the queen did not see him . he descended into a court , and , seeing the garden door open , went in . being tempted by the pleasantness of the place , he walked there a while . at last he came to a fountain , where he washed his face and hands to refresh himself .
[male] stood still , and watched him , and he swelled himself . and puffed , and stretched himself out stiff . and at last -- crack , puff , bang -- he opened all down his back . and then up to the top of his head , and out of his inside came the most slender . elegant , soft creature , as soft and smooth as [male] : but very pale and weak .
there was once a queen , who had not been blessed with children , as she walked in her garden . she prayed every morning that a son or daughter might be given to her . then one day an angel came , and said to her : be content . you shall have a son , and he shall be endowed with the power of wishing . so that whatsoever he wishes for shall be granted to him .
he went up into a tree then , and was throwing down apples and all sorts to the pigs . a giant came out , and when he saw the lad up on the tree throwing down the apples to the pigs . the head rose on him , he came to the tree . get down out of that , says he , i think you big for one bite and small for two bites . come down till i draw you under my long cold teeth .
so [female] sat down on a stone by the foot of the tree . and put on the wooden shoes , which fitted him very nicely . now these shoes were magic shoes , and [male] had hardly stepped into them before they turned his feet inland . so [male] obediently let the shoes guide him . at corners the shoes always turned in the right direction .
how might the good folks be getting on , up stairs and down stairs ? yes , there was writing about that , and many things can be put into a letter . bright [male] and dark , heavy days . both of these were in the letter which brought the news that his father was dead . and that his mother was alone now , she wrote that [female] had come down to see her .
neither of [location] replied , our souls were suddenly sickened at this sort of dealing . wisconsin street was a blaze of light , the buses were on their way from the `` depots '' to the hotels . nobody knew who might be in those buses , they were the nexus between [location] and the unguessed world . strangers were on the streets , everything was in motion .
the girl was overcome with joy at the sight of his magnificent possessions . and when he led her in and through one handsome room after another she could hardly control her pride and delight . afterward he showed her through the gardens . and the flowers were so many and various that she had never seen the like before . the evil one and his bride now lived very happily together for a month , but at the end of that time he told the girl that he was obliged to go away on a journey and that he would not return for three days .
then he laid the dead body back in the coffin . folded the hands , and took leave of it . and went away contentedly through the great forest , all around him he could see the prettiest little elves dancing in the moonlight . which shone through the trees , they were not disturbed by his appearance . for they knew he was good and harmless among men .
a fire was quickly lighted , for they found within it [male] and fir branches . they arranged their couch as well as possible , the men seated themselves around the fire . smoked their tobacco and drank the warm spicy drink . which they had prepared for themselves , [male] had his share too and they told him of the mysterious beings of the alpine country . of the singular fighting snakes in the deep lakes .
no sooner said than done , a [male] under each side . and one in front , took him over in a crack . he got on his legs , and walked quietly by all those giants . lions , fiery serpents . and all manner of other frightful things too numerous to mention , while they were fast asleep .
aria made it last as long as she possibly could . it was summer , and they needed but small fires and cheaper clothing and even . so it seemed to them -- simpler food than in the cold weather . then they were able to earn a fair amount by odd work in the hay fields and so on . when work was at its best , and once a week , at least , they trudged all the way to market laden with their loveliest flowers .
no gentleman 's house was near , and bilsington priory had passed away with all its holy train of priests . and nothing was to be seen of their former glory , and no vestige of themselves either . unless it was true that a monk walked occasionally round the walls with ghostly tread . and moaned , deeply and sadly , as he compared the past with the present . in short , it was a wild , weird country , and wild , weird people dwelt there .
the above illustration , however , proves that there were exceptions to the prevalent puritan objection to figure ornament . in one of mrs. s.c. [female] 's papers . `` pilgrimages to english shrines , '' contributed in 1849 to `` the art journal , '' she describes the interior of the house which was built for [female] . the protector 's daughter , who married general [female] .
the morning was bleak , and the rain fell in occasional showers that the wind swept . with moaning sighs , over the naked waste , the canvas of the tents flapped and creaked . straining against the poles and cords that held them in place . a heavy gloom brooded over the wretched camp , so that even the squabbling children spoke with bated breath . within [male] 's silent tent sat [male] of the golden locks .
happily for [location] children , ( for this occurred before we were at the age of story hearing . or indeed at any age at all , ) he did face the channel once more . and never sought to tempt it again , but all this i only learned many years after . and during the whole of the early portion of my life . i ( in common , i am sure , with the great majority of his acquaintance ) .
many years went by , and [male] had grown a big boy . and was very useful to the cowherd and his wife , he could shoot now with his bow and arrow in a manner which would have pleased his first teacher . and he and his playfellows -- the sons of charcoal burners and woodmen . were wont to keep the pots supplied at home with the game they found in the forest . besides this , he filled the pails full of water from the stream .
he himself , however , repaired unto the king . and told him of the little man and his proposal . the king was a merry lord . and therefore it pleased him well that the overseer had kept the little man for their amusement . he directed him to make preparations in a large meadow behind the castle .
here , a long straight row of columns is known as the `` giant 's organ , '' and tradition pictures the scene when the giants of old . with their gigantic families , sat on the causeway and listened to the music . there , a group of isolated pillars is called the `` giant 's chimneys , '' since they once furnished an exit for the smoke of the gigantic kitchen .
he then rose , and put on his clothes , and went out , he took a look at the house when he went out . and it was a palace , the like of which he had never seen . and the king himself did not possess . he then took a walk round the farm . and he never saw so many cattle , sheep , and horses as were on it .
but these were as clever as most grownup people are among us , he explained to them what they saw in the pictures of life on the castle walls . the doings of man , and the progress of events in all the lands of the earth . and the sons often expressed a wish that they could be present . and take a part in these great deeds , then their father told them that in the world there was nothing but [male] and difficulty . that it was not quite what it appeared to them .
the land tax , or rather the yearly rent paid by the tenant , is usually assessed at forty per cent . of the produce ; but there is no principle clearly defining it . and frequently the landowner and the cultivator divide the proceeds of the harvest in equal shapes . rice land is divided into three classes . and , according to these classes , it is computed that one tan of the best land should yield to the owner a revenue of five bags of rice per annum .
so the years passed , and every year princess [female] grew lovelier and lovelier . so that no one who saw her could guess how wicked she was . in a far off country lived a young prince whose name was [male] . he had a dear friend named [male] . whom he loved better than any one in the world , [male] was tall .
—the balloon ascents of last season . i must return to the balloons , why did the bleeding man start out of them , never mind . if i inquire , he will be back again , the balloons . this particular public have inherently a great pleasure in the contemplation of physical difficulties overcome . mainly , as i take it , because the lives of a large majority of them are exceedingly monotonous and real .
no man shall be admitted here , till he a fine doth pay . and he that will not pay the fine , from hence must fly away , by him that rides here over land . a silver bell is paid , he that flies hither through the air . must bring a dark faced maid , while he that through the sea doth swim . must bring a cockle shell with him , by order , m. r .
the wife of the viking lived in care and sorrow about it . and yet her heart yearned towards the little creature , of whose condition she felt she should not dare tell her husband on his return . for he would probably , according to the custom which then prevailed , expose the child on the public highway . and let whoever listed take it away , the good viking woman could not find it in her heart to allow this . and she therefore determined that the viking should never see the child except by daylight .
there they stood , and the executioners were preparing to fling them into the copper . when the king , who was not expected back so soon , entered the courtyard on horseback . he had ridden post haste , and in great astonishment asked what was the meaning of this horrible spectacle ? no one dared tell him , when the ogress . enraged at what she saw , flung herself head foremost into the copper .
so the ambassador put the little shoe carefully in his pocket and set out on his errand . he rode , and he rode , and he rode . going to every town and castle that came in his way . and summoning all the ladies to appear before him to try on the shoe . and , as he caused a proclamation to be made that whoever could wear it should be the prince 's bride .
for some years he did not trouble himself about his wife 's absence . but his mother began nagging at him , saying that he ought to find out where she went and what she did . taking his mother 's advice , he disguised himself and followed his wife to a lonely part of a forest not far from their home . hiding himself behind a huge rock , he noticed from this point of vantage that his wife took off her girdle and threw it down in the deep grass near a dark pool . then she vanished , and the next moment he saw a large and handsome snake glide through the grass .
upon every square inch , but if the bore of the tube is only half a square inch . and therefore the 30 inches of [person] only weigh seven 1/2 lbs . instead of 15 lbs. , the pressure of the atmosphere will also be halved . because it will only act upon half a square inch of surface . and for this reason it will make no difference to the height of the [person] whether the tube be broad or narrow .
the young people amused themselves on the lawn . playing croquet and flitting about among the flowers , each young girl gathering a flower to put in the buttonhole of some one of the gentlemen . the young scotch lady looked about for a flower . but none of them seemed to please her . until , happening to glance over the fence , she espied the fine .
then , with tears in her eyes , the princess took leave of her old horse . who galloped back to her father , she had ridden only a few miles further . when she saw a golden curl lying on the road before her . checking her horse , she asked whether it would be better to take it or let it lie . `` if you take it , '' said sunlight .
all the time he glanced right and left as if expecting to find what he was looking for . but he was in no hurry , and often a glad little song broke from his lips . whilst the sound of his strong stick on the cobble stones had a cheery note that echoed along the houses . [male] felt like a bird of the air . that could fly whither it would , and for which each tree was a resting place .
so he sent up [male] and aithalides to tell [male] that he was ready for the fight . and they went up among the marble walls , and beneath the roofs of gold . and stood in [male] 's hall , while he grew pale with rage . fulfil your promise to us , child of the blazing sun . give [location] the serpents teeth , and let loose the fiery bulls .
the first night passed without any alarm , the monk and his hosts spending the dreary hours in watching and waiting . the following day , however , was as stormy as the worst enemy of the ferry could have wished . and , when night fell , all the dwellers in the cottage . as well as the silent monk , gathered together again to wait for the cries . but some hours passed without any other sounds having been heard than those caused by the restless wind .
your home , when it is entered , is just what it should be . quiet , small , -- with everything she wishes , and nothing more than she wishes . the sun strikes it in the happiest possible way . the piano is the sweetest toned in the world . the library is stocked to a charm ; and [female] .
the old prince was [male] , sultan of the wechabites . for some time had he lived without children . at last a prince , for whom he had so ardently longed , was born to him . but the astrologer , whom he consulted respecting the destiny of his son . told him that , until his twenty second year , he would be in danger of being supplanted by an enemy .
as soon as he reached the gate he wheeled round . the foal gave a tremendous kick at the latch . whereupon the gate , and with it a portion of the railing . heeled over into the dust , the landlady , a diabolical old witch . then came running to the gate with a lamp in her hand .
he had lived quite long enough in the world to take care of himself . he was a conceited fellow , the old lobster . and not very civil to [male] ; and you will hear how he had to alter his mind before he was done . as conceited people generally have , but he was so funny , and [male] so lonely . that he could not quarrel with him ; and they used to sit in holes in the rocks .
but the bear would not be moved by his speeches , he gave the ill disposed creature a blow with his paw . and he lay lifeless on the ground . meanwhile the maidens were running away , making off for home as well as they could . but all of a sudden they were stopped by a well-known voice that called out . [male] , [male] , stay ! do not fear .
slinging his shield upon his left arm , he plucked the spear from the ground and leaped on to his horse . with a light heart he swam back over the lake . and nowhere could he see the black cormorants of the western seas . but three white swans floating abreast followed him to the bank . when he reached the bank he galloped down to the sea .
sometimes [female] would go down into the bowels of the earth and turn on a stream of water so as to meet the deep fires which are ever burning far down below us . then there would come an awful earthquake , because [male] wanted to get out , and the earth crust would not let him . but tried to hold him down , sometimes [male] slipped down into a volcano 's mouth . then the mountain , in order to save itself from being choked . had to spit [male] out , and this always made a terrible mess on the ground .
so the four travelled along together , [male] was overjoyed to have met with such gifted companions . and paid their expenses generously , without complaining of the enormous sum of money he had to spend on the amount of food broad consumed . after some days they reached the princess 's palace . [female] had told them the object of his journey . and had promised each a large reward if he was successful , they gave him their word to work with a will at the task which every one up till then had failed to accomplish .
so one day the king came out into the palace yard . and when he had walked about a bit , he wanted to drink out of his pump . for you must know the day was hot , and the king very thirsty . but when they poured him out a glass . it was so muddy , and nasty , and foul , that the king got quite vexed .
the object of all these plots and plans . good and evil intentions , was , however , safe in [location] , and had he been content to stay where he was . safe he would have remained , but as soon as young [male] arrived upon the english coast he had written to [male] to explain his conduct in the affair with [male] . to the colonel of his regiment to ask him for the means of establishing his identity as a captain in one of his majesty 's dragoon regiments . to his agent to send him a sum of money .
it was not discovered that any tattoo has a special meaning . except the head taker 's emblem ; and the igorot consistently maintains that all the others are put on simply at the whim of the wearer . the face markings , those on the arms . the stomach , and elsewhere on the body , are believed to be purely aesthetic . the people compare their tattoo with the figures of an american 's shirt or coat .
the imperative is only used for the second person , in the first and third it is replaced by the subjunctive , ex . di ango , let [location] go . to n'alo , speak , that i may know ; go di go , go that we may go . the two forms of the subjunctive are distinguished only in composition . and have not yet been clearly understood , the last syllable besides is rarely heard except in questions .
she suffered all in silence , not daring to complain to her father . who was entirely ruled by his new wife , when her daily work was done she used to sit down in the chimney corner among the ashes . from which the two sisters gave her the nick name of [male] . but [male] , however shabbily clad , was handsomer than they were with all their fine clothes . it happened that the king 's son gave a series of balls .
under the arm of the oak i saw a tiny house of white . neat , well ordered , full of cheerfulness , through the wall of canvas . for it now seemed to be after dusk -- there shone a faint pink gleam of light . the soul of [organization] , its pure spirit of content . as it shone , it scarce seemed lit by mortal hand .
then she told them a story . it was not like any of [female] 's world stories . but the children liked it , it was all about a gorgeous bird she had at home in her tree house . she told how she had heard it singing one morning in early spring . high up in the branches of her tree , and how she had watched it day after day flying back and forth in the forest .
[female] felt strangely chilled , pan was not herself tonight . she did not even look herself , he had been accustomed to seeing her in [location] dress . tonight she wore the chinese costume . but for her clear cut features she might have been a chinese girl , he shivered . within her sleeves pan 's small hands struggled together ; but her face and voice were calm .
so just as the lad had done throwing the ox hides . with the spikes , over [female] , and had cast down the tar barrel on the plain . and had got well up into the spruce fir , up galloped a horse , with fire flashing out of his nostrils . and the flame caught the tar barrel at once , then [male] and the strange horse began to fight till the stones flew heaven high . they fought and bit , and kicked , both with fore feet and hind feet .
one day , after the lapse of many years . he met [male] , who recognized him . and tearless , but sunk in bitter reflection . he sat upon his hard couch , and then knelt down -- before whom ? before the stone cross fastened to the wall ? no , it was only habit that made him take this position .
the only person who was not quite happy was the king 's brother . the heir presumptive , who would have been king one day had the baby not been born . but as his majesty was very kind to him . and even rather sorry for him -- insomuch that at the queen 's request he gave him a dukedom almost as big as a county . the crown prince , as he was called , tried to seem pleased also ; and let [location] hope he succeeded .
so the story teller married the princess and succeeded to the throne upon the death of the king . once upon a time a king wanted a good rabbit keeper . he made it known throughout the country that he would give not only good pay . but also the hand of the princess , to any youth who could take good care of his wonderful rabbits . now it happened that an old farmer had three very lazy sons .
the shuttlecock had fallen , but he heard it not . and remained inattentive to his duties , how could it be otherwise , he was hundreds of miles away . why about you pick up the shuttlecock ? cried the prince , in a sharp , impatient tone.—witikind started , and ran forward in a random way . but he could not see it : tears were blinding his eyes .
it was during one of these hunting excursions that [female] . roused by the excitement of the chase , urged her palfrey to its utmost speed . and distancing all her companions , came suddenly to a small level plateau amid the mountains . here a little streamlet had its birth , gushing forth from the rock itself in cold purity . the hawk was already stooping over its quarry , and [female] finding herself alone .
the mountain at the foot of which we were cast was the coast of a very long and large island . this coast was covered all over with wrecks , and from the vast number of men 's bones we saw everywhere . and which filled [location] with horror , we concluded that abundance of people had died there . it is also impossible to tell what a quantity of goods and riches we found cast ashore there . all these objects served only to augment our grief , whereas in all other places rivers run from their channels into the sea .
they searched a long time before they could find the iron door through which he had disappeared the preceding day . and great [female] did it cost them before they were able to break it open . they then found themselves in a great vaulted chamber wherein sat a beautiful [female] at a table , working . she started up , and threw herself at their feet . thanking them as her deliverers , and told them that she was the daughter of a king .
the father , too , remained quite silent , as if every thing was as it ought to be . his mother then set the meat before him . and his father bid him eat . but he let the food lie untouched . and said that he knew now where he could get much better food .
now the wonderful bird paused in its flight , and [female] saw the small light . suspended in the air , hovering over one particular spot : he groped about . his hands feeling everywhere -- what was he to find ? all at once , close above his head the pitiful voice was again heard . but this time quite near , with breathless anxiety [male] scaled the rock . quite unable to see where he was going ; but his hands were always outstretched .
the scarecrow might have called his court , but he was in no mood for more of the silver islanders idea of a good time , he longed for the dear friends of his loved land of oz . one by one the lights winked out in the gardens , and the noisy company dispersed . and soon no one in the palace was awake but the scarecrow . his straw was wet and soggy , and even his excellent brains felt damp and dull .
but the merchant would not believe him , and said he had had but one son . his poor [male] , who he knew was long since dead : and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd . he would not even give him anything to eat . the king , however , still vowed that he was his son . and said , `` is there no mark by which you would know me if i am really your son ? ''
farther and farther sank the sun , leaving clouds of purple and gold to fade into the soft shades of twilight . the hush of evening fell upon nature ; stars peeped out . [female] watched the waning light until , too tired to keep her eyes open . she laid her head upon her little knapsack . and was soon in a deep slumber , whether or not wild beasts came prowling about .
the festivals held in cities in honour of special divinities . or in commemoration of particular events , were conducted with an elaborate ceremonial . gorgeous processions , games , chariot races . and c. , were conspicuous features on these occasions . and dramatic performances , representing particular episodes in the lives of the gods and heroes .
the next day all this happened again , the pigeon flew in at [male] 's window . changed into the prince , and talked to her for an hour , and when the hour was over changed back into a pigeon again and flew away . leaving her a fig , which he told her to cut open . and to wear what she should find inside it , she cut open the fig . and inside it she found a dress on which the azure sea and all its white waves were painted .
both the lady and the gentleman were thinking of nothing but themselves and they continued to do this even when a door opened and their son entered the room . it was difficult for him to get into the room . he was carrying something which he could not manage very well . but no one offered to help him , presently he had got quite into the room . leaving the door open , the thing he carried was a kite .
as the fire came roaring and rushing down the slope with its intolerable heat and suffocating smoke . ready to hurl itself over brook and leaf tree wall in order to reach the opposite shore without having to pause . the people drew back at first as if unable to withstand it ; but they did not flee far before they turned back . the conflagration raged with savage force . sparks poured like a rain of fire over the leaf trees .
he heard many more fine things about himself . and that the next day he was to be married , after this he went back to the forest to rest himself in his trunk . it had disappeared , a spark from the fireworks which remained had set it on fire . it was burnt to ashes , so the merchant 's son could not fly any more . nor go to meet his bride , she stood all day on the roof waiting for him .
this token of submission delighted his majesty . and , high in hope , he waited with impatience for her return . some time passed and at last he went out ; but nothing could be seen or heard of the captive daughter . then calling together his followers , he sallied forth with them upon the plains . they had not gone far when they espied by the light of the moon .
as he spoke , the eyes of mr. [male] were fixed on the leading article of the times . not on his wife , presently lady [male] glided from the room . without her absence being at the moment observed , once in her dressing room . she turned the key , and sinking into a low chair . gave vent to her grief in some of the bitterest tears she had ever shed .
there happened to be near a large tree thick with leaves . which i ascended in hopes of concealment , and was no sooner fixed in a place where i could not be perceived . than i saw the vessel come to the creek where she lay the first time . the old man with his slaves landed immediately , and advanced towards the subterranean dwelling . with a countenance that shewed some hope ; but when they saw the earth had been newly removed .
it seemed almost as if the days of [female] were come back again . for [female] 's golden hair and snowy skin . [female] 's blue eyes and graceful form . attracted the wealthiest and most powerful nobles of the land to woo her . days came and went , and [female] 's cheek grew paler and her father 's eye more gloomy .
the boy sat down on the edge of the spring to watch it . sometimes he would see a gold fish or a golden snake darting through it . and he guarded it well , so that nothing should fall into it . one day as he was sitting like this his finger pained him so much that involuntarily he dipped it into the water . he drew it out very quickly , but saw that it was gilded .
but [male] did not notice , he was too much excited at the tumult going on outside . he ran hastily to the window and looked out , the square was full of soldiers and banners and gayly decked horses . men at arms crowded the side streets . pouring continuously into the square , the ruined porch of the library was crowded . a guard stood at the portal .
jessica : was it possible , [person] , that you could be deceived as to the conclusion of this love story ? why , even i saw joy coming as plain as a pikestaff . [person] : and i , with love for its bearer . for that magician , who touches the plainest things with a [person] , makes plain girls and boys look queens and kings . and plain staves flowering branches of joy .
from sir [male] 's body he would not part . lifting the old knight to his arms , he laid him across his horse . and led the steed by the bridle rein till they came to an abbey . where he left the body with the abbot . promising rich presents in return for giving it sumptuous burial with masses and chants .
his mother just said , `` wait , '' and kept watching mrs. [female] . soon the school busses drove up and a lot of kids got out . there was all of mrs. [female] 's class . and a lot of other kids besides . they came over to the bridge , but they did not come across it .
then he suddenly remembered the fish 's scale . which , with the [organization] 's feather and the fox 's hairs . he always carried about with him , he drew the scale from his pocket . and hurrying to the river he threw it in . in a minute the grateful fish swam towards the bank on which [male] was standing .
he asked the king to let the housemaid take his place by his majesty that night . and went and lay down on the floor of the corridor , no farther off than a whisper would reach from the door of the chamber . there , with an old mantle of the king 's thrown over him . he was soon fast asleep , somewhere about the middle of the night . he woke suddenly , started to his feet , and rubbed his eyes .
this scornful challenge was proclaimed by heralds in every neighbouring town and hamlet . in response came many wooers to attempt the impossible task . those whom [female] favoured she made her partners at the rustic fetes and open-air dances which were then in vogue . in the soft swarded meadows , by sunlight or starlight . the dancers would meet , and , to the dreamy music of the pipes .
[female] 's mother was sitting on a stone to rest . with a fagot of sticks lying before her . which she had picked up in the wood , then [female] turned back . she who was so finely dressed she felt ashamed of her mother . a poorly clad woman , who picked up wood in the forest .
of course restitution was out of the question . and even [female] felt that any merely temporal punishment would be weakly inadequate to the demands of justice . but that night , in the dead silence of his chamber . [male] registered a great and solemn swear that so soon as he could worry together a little capital . he would fling his feeble remaining energies into the spendthrift business .
the dressing of [male] was , however , easier said than done , for it would hurt the pride of the [male] to have clothes presented to him as to a schoolboy . but [male] soon settled the matter , the [female] . she said , would never notice the difference , if they put one garment at a time into his sleeping room and took away the other . this was what her father had always done when the wardrobe of his dependent needed renewing . nor had the [female] ever showed the least consciousness of the change .
such were the adventures of the young man who was reading in the hospital . we now recite those of the youth who was listening to him . upon the sultan 's inquiring his story , he began as follows . my lord , i was by profession a merchant . and on my commencing business the youngest of my trade .
at the end of a week 's journey the soldier reached the golden plain . which lies between the [person] mountains and the sea . this terrible creature , i must tell you , was a kind of fearsome winged horse . it was larger than any earthly animal , black as midnight in color . and armored over the chest and head with a sheath of dragon 's scales .
the faces of the sister and brother shone upon each other from their opposite sides of the lodge with a kindly gleam of mutual trustfulness . and never more from that hour did a doubt of each other darken their little household . or in time past -- we can not tell exactly how many . many years ago -- a poor indian was living with his wife and children in a beautiful part of the country . he was not only poor , but he had the misfortune to be inexpert in procuring food for his family .
they sang like nightingales among the thickets . and [female] stopped to hear their song ; but the words which they spoke he could not understand . no , nor no man after him for many a hundred years . so he stepped forward and saw them dancing , hand in hand around the charmed tree . which bent under its golden fruit ; and round the tree foot was coiled the dragon .
but the stern upholder of the law did not feel that he had the right to disobey the instructions of his father . and so the elixir descended to his son , and was given to him on his twenty fifth birthday by his guardian . for [male] died before his only child reached that age . what happened to this second [male] whose [male] history ... here the story broke off , the son of one of my friends had found it in an old chest .
the sun shone warmly . and the snow sparkled as if covered with glittering diamonds , numerous insects . especially butterflies and bees , lay dead in heaps on the snow . they had ventured too high , or the wind had carried them here and left them to die of cold . around the wetterhorn hung a feathery cloud .
the three princes laid each his hand on his sword . and swore to be avenged of the brutal treatment of their fellow beings . next morning when the giant issued forth . hurling the password at the mountain , then disappeared from sight . the oldest prince declared that he should be the first to enter the mountain .
ares , upon one occasion , incurred the anger of [male] by slaying his son halirrhothios . who had insulted alcippe , the daughter of the war god , for this deed . [female] summoned [female] to appear before the tribunal of the olympic gods . which was held upon a hill in athens , [female] was acquitted . and this event is supposed to have given rise to the name areopagus .
some weeks passed , during which the peasant did not come round to ask after the calf . being frightened lest it should cost him another hundred dollar . for he had begun to squirm a bit at having to part with so much money . meanwhile the clerk decided that the calf was as fat as it could be . so he killed it , after he had got all the beef out of the way he went inside .
and he seized hold of the creeping plants . and the roots of trees -- climbed up the moist stones where the water snakes were writhing and the toads were croaking . and he gained the summit before the sun had quite gone down . how magnificent was the sight from this height ! the sea -- the great , the glorious sea , that dashed its long waves against the coast .
sang queen [female] and king [male] . as they went climbing to their splendid palace on the top of a high hill . and there we will bid them all adieu ! now when the lord of the castle went riding by the green meadow , this silly goose girl would run after the carriage . shouting his name and throwing bouquets of wild flowers to him , but alas !
when he returned [male] was heavy with child . [male] left them , going above as a bird flies . soon the child was born , the water subsided in [male] pueblo . and [male] with his sister and her babe returned to the pueblo . children came to the household rapidly and in great numbers .
now night and day [female] wore the ring which [male] le [male] had placed on his finger . and as long as it was there no youth about the court was [male] and more splendid than he . the gift with which he had been endowed in his cradle had lost none of its power . and as he passed through the crowd , towering full a head over other men . the hearts of the ladies went out towards him .
the second daughter of the ruler of heaven once came down upon the earth and secretly became the wife of a mortal man named [male] . and when she returned to heaven she was blessed with a son . but the ruler of heaven was very angry at this desecration of the heavenly halls . he banished her to earth and covered her with the wu i hills . her son , however , [female] by name .
he loosed his huge grey cloak from his neck . dragged it from his shoulders , and gathered its collar firmly in his hand . then he crouched down once more behind the hill nearest to the approaching travelers . so like to the ashes in color was the giant 's great body that he was almost indistinguishable . as with eyes glued to the opening in the side of the hill .
his eyes gleamed , and then closed in death , the tolling of the church bell was the last sound that echoed above him . above the dead man ; and they buried him . covering him with earth that had been brought from [male] . and in which was mingled the dust of many of the pious dead , when years had gone by his skeleton was dug up . as the skeletons of the monks who had died before him had been .
there was , however , made about this time by [female] , to whose earlier work reference has been made in the previous chapter . some excellent furniture , which , while to some extent following the fashion of the day . did so more reasonably , the rosewood and mahogany tables . chairs , cabinets and sideboards of his make . inlaid with scrolls and lines of flat brass .
so the prince gave her his hand and led her out . and they mounted the chariot together ; it was even more splendid than before . and so was the whole company , even the horses shoes were of rubies with diamond nails . and i suppose that is the first time such a thing was ever seen , as the princess was as kind and clever as she was beautiful . you may imagine what a delightful journey the prince found it .
`` ' a bird is as good as a fish , any day , '' he said to himself ; and if it 's such a bird as you say . i can use it as a fish hook , that was what he said to the [male] . and was so pleased with the goose , now , he had not gone far before he met another old woman . and as soon as she saw the lovely gold goose she was all for running up to it and patting it .
on my way the itching of the night before returned . and this time i felt it in both my hands . i knew that my sister and myself , in common with the king and all his subjects . had been handling the dead leaves freely since i had worked the cure , and i began to be uneasy . when i knocked at the king 's door the voice of the fool said `` come in , ''
the wedding was scarcely over , when the stepmother 's bad temper began to show itself . she could not bear the goodness of this young girl . because it made her own daughters appear the more odious . the stepmother gave her the meanest work in the house to do . she had to scour the dishes , tables , etc. .
on the sand reef lay the wreck of a ship . which was covered with water at high tide ; the white figure head rested against the anchor . the sharp iron edge of which rose just above the surface . [male] had come in contact with this ; the tide had driven him against it with great force . he sank down stunned with the blow , but the next wave lifted him and the young girl up again .
`` the monks , '' murmured a few under their breath ; and silence fell again , each listening . [female] in her white dress now gazed from an upper window . seeing her lover with his enemies drawing continually closer around him . perhaps it was well for him that his death alone would not have served to lock their secret up again . that the white [male] in the window is ready to speak the word and direct instant vengeance on them and their dragon if any ill befall that young man who stands by the iron door .
she said the last two names and as she did the witch of the elders screamed and ran behind the stones . [female] saw no more of her , that evening her husband brought home the web of cloth that her step mother had woven . the next day [male] began to make clothes for him out of it . never again did she make delays at the well but she came straight home with her pails of water . the fire was always clear upon the hearth and she had never to light it the second time and then [female] away the ashes that had gathered on the floor .
so they went together to the wedding , in the evening . when the two were alone together , he dropped his fur skin , and , ceasing to be a wolf . became a prince again , now they did not know that the princess 's mother was hidden in the room . when she saw the white skin lying on the floor . she crept out of the room , and sent a servant to fetch the skin and to burn it in the kitchen fire .
on the third night , while [female] was in her bed with her baby beside her . and while her sisters in law were in the room . a strange music was heard outside , it was played all round the king 's house . whoever heard it fell into deep slumber , the kern that were on guard slept . the maids that were whispering together fell into a slumber , and a deep sleep came upon [female] and her child and on her three sisters in law who watched in the chamber .
after which he went to his home , found his parents . and with great joy told them all that had befallen him . and how an old woman had helped him , and begged their blessing on his travels . so his parents gave him their blessing . and , mounting his good steed , he set forth on his journey .
but when they came to the place where all roads meet . the prince was greatly perplexed , for this time , you see . he knew where he wanted to go , in the end . he trusted to chance and rode ahead . but they had not gone far before they came to the castle of the wizard with three dragons .
rosebud was a spanish girl , with purple tinged hair . soft black eyes , and clear [female] complexion . through the satin skin the warm blood flushed her cheeks . and her lips were more tempting than ripe cherries ; but [female] was a rare german [female] in complexion . clear and fair as the noonday , her eyes were like violets .
so the brother retraced his steps toward the skeleton . but to his surprise it had disappeared , and the tracks of the wearer of the ball were in another direction . he now became faint with hunger . and lost heart ; but when he remembered the blood of his sisters . and that he should not be allowed to enjoy a meal , or so much as a mouthful .
the goths would fain have made him their king . in [male] 's stead , but [male] was too loyal a soul to supplant his uncle 's own son . on his shield he laid the infant prince . hardred , and held him up for the people to see , and when he had proclaimed the child king and vowed to serve him faithfully all the days of his life . there was no man there who did not loyally [male] the promise of their hero , [male] .
the fame of the purse was thus spread abroad ; and we were able to account for our newly acquired wealth . without incurring any suspicion as to the manner of obtaining it . at this time ; for reasons which will presently appear , i induced vimardaka to enter the service of arthapati . and directed him to use all possible means to excite his master against [male] . in this he had no difficulty ; for the father of kulapâlika .
she laid a beautiful egg of gold . and at last the giant began to snore ; [male] waited a minute . then , growing bold , he crept from the oven along the floor . and caught the hen in his arms , and then fled through the door . but the giant heard him leave the house .
with that he spat on the floor ; yet somehow in the very act and instant one could realize that the man had been brought up as a gentleman . the [location] pressman considered him with more attention . his face was pale and dissipated , with the promise of [male] passions yet to be loosed . but it was a clever and sensitive face . his clothes were coarse and careless , but he had a good seal ring on one of his long , thin fingers .
there was a rustling noise heard in the forest . and then something from behind the trees fell upon the robbers . they were knocked from their horses , and scattered on all sides . yet no hand was seen to touch them , the robbers . thrown upon the ground , could not raise themselves , and the hunter .
she made her way aboard . inside she found it lined with lovely velvet . the seats of pure gold and the walls studded with diamonds . then , all of a sudden , the barque turned and went out to sea . the princess ran up and caught hold of the oars .
he left the church then , and his heart was heavy enough . but he shut the door and locked it . and left the key where he found it . he sat down on a tombstone that was near the door . and began thinking , he was in great doubt what he should do .
his method is rendered available for any one by this book , the man of the house finally took all the disabled umbrellas to the repairer 's . next morning on his way to his office . when he got up to leave the street car . he absentmindedly laid hold of the umbrella belonging to a woman beside him . for he was in the habit of carrying one , the woman cried `` stop thief ! ''
one day the king went out for a pleasure ride with his daughter . and many of his court rode with him . the cat then led [male] to a river . where he knew the king would pass before long , he then bade [male] take off his clothes and hide them under a rock . and then stand in the river up to his neck , [male] waited until he saw his master well in the river .
babadag turned swiftly , and at that moment i sprang upon him . but the old man snatched forth a knife , and as i caught and held the arm which was lifted to strike . a small dark figure darted in from the doorway and flung something over the old man 's neck from behind . the knife dropped from [male] 's hand . he swayed , tottered , collapsed , and fell full length on the floor .
there are plenty of children , and they can consume abundance of food . they rush out of the houses , and throng about the travellers . come they on foot or in carriage . the whole horde of children traffic . the little ones offer prettily carved wooden houses , for sale .
all this while poor [female] had been so amazed that he could do nothing but stand and stare like one stricken dumb . whereupon all the people , thinking him guilty , dragged him off to the judge . reviling him and heaping words of abuse upon him . now the judge of that town was known far and near as the wise judge ', . but never had he had such a knotty question as this brought up before him .
at these words the merchant bowed low , and replied that he would that very day sail for the land of the dawn in his fastest ship . then , returning home , he gave orders that the best vessel in all his fleets be immediately prepared for the journey . and so swiftly was this done , that the merchant sailed for the land of the dawn on the morning tide . many days and many leagues he sailed . over shining seas , till he reached the harbor of the land of the dawn .
and at last he gave up catching even the flies ; for he made acquaintance with one by accident and found him a very merry little fellow . and this was the way it happened ; and it is all quite true . he was basking at the top of the water one hot day in july . catching duns and feeding the trout , when he saw a new sort . a dark gray little fellow with a brown head , he was a very little fellow indeed .
we are so willing to be lenient to the [male] , for a greater than we has visited them with sorrow such as man could not inflict . but it ended otherwise than his friends anticipated , the three kings lay there like a deserted house . and although the tall chimney on the roof began to belch forth streams of smoke by night . as well as by day , hardly four weeks after the death of [male] . it was commonly supposed that the place was unoccupied , commonly supposed : for once in a while the knocker was heard when [female] winckler called .
now [male] the giant killer , coming that way . was so taken with the generosity of the prince , that he desired to be his servant . this being agreed upon , the next morning they set forward on their journey together . when , as they were riding out of the town , an old woman called after the prince . saying , he has owed me twopence these seven years .
again there was a cheer , but a short one , for the spell of expectancy was on all . the young man descended into the court , and the air seemed to turn to a wavering mist as he looked up at the manor windows seeking to spy [male] 's face at one of them . was this to be the end ? could he kiss her one last good by if disaster was in store for them after all , alas ! no glimpse of her was to be seen as he moved along , hardly aware of his own steps . and the keys jingling lightly as he moved , through the crowd he passed .
now one of them has his leg thrust out from under the bed . so the lad brings his sword down and cuts it off . then another thrusts his arm out at other side of the bed . and the lad cuts that off , so at last he had maimed them all . and they all went crying and wailing off , and forgot the ball , but he took it from under the bed .
so [female] peeped in again , and pretty soon he saw a tiny light way down deep . like the flicker of a candle , and by and by , as his eyes grew used to the darkness . he saw a flight of stairs . then what do you think he did ? jump into the hollow stump and climb down ? that 's just what he did , and it was not long before he found himself in a little hall opposite a small door with a glass knob inside of which was an electric light .
i incline to the belief that all these things combined to constitute the charm whereof i speak . [female] had not the beauty that would be likely to attract one other own sex . she had none of the sprightliness and wit of womankind . and she seemed to be wholly unacquainted with the little arts , accomplishments and vanities in which women invariably find amusement . she was simply a strange , lonely creature who had accepted valorously her duty to minister to the comfort of her brother .
all three of the young man 's brothers in law had admired the power of his magic boot and they had all advised him to visit the land of the king of giants by means of it . after having left each of his three sisters full of happiness in her costly palace he felt free to act upon this advice . so by means of his magic boot he again found himself in a new country . he soon heard on the street that the king of the land of giants had a beautiful giantess daughter whom he wished to give in marriage if she could be persuaded to choose a husband . she was such a famous beauty that no one could pass before her palace without eagerly gazing up in hopes of seeing her lovely face at the window .
young men in strange garb sat at the small tables . their faces were wonderfully animated and gay , before each one stood a long necked bottle wound with straw . cups were filled , emptied , waved aloft or clinked , with every moment the eyes of the drinkers grew brighter . their gestures freer and more lively ; finally one of them sprang up on a table . he was the handsomest of them all , -- her own [female] .
jurgen felt overcome by a holy , childlike feeling . like that which possessed him , when , as a boy , he stood in the splendid spanish cathedral . but here the feeling was different , for he felt conscious of being one of the congregation . she left skjagen and went to norway two days later . he remained behind , and made himself useful on the farm and at the fishery .
soon after that , all three stood in the house yard , two of them fell asleep the instant they stood still . but the third looked about him eagerly , to find where they could get under cover . it was not a small farm , beside the dwelling house and stable and smoke house . there were long ranges with granaries and storehouses and cattlesheds . but it all looked awfully poor and dilapidated , the houses had gray , moss grown , leaning walls .
the two brothers started home with the lady . on the way ur found the head of an old horse with teeth in it . and took them , saying , `` these will be my father 's three teeth . '' they travelled on , and reached home at last , ur would not have left a tooth in his father 's mouth . trying to put in the three that he had brought ; but the father stopped him .
and there is an old story , that , not long after this , tell did shoot the tyrant with one of his arrows . and thus he set his country free , a great army was marching into swit zer land . if it should go much farther , there would be no driving it out again . the soldiers would burn the towns , they would [male] the farmers of their grain and sheep . they would make slaves of the people .
but it was not granted to him to show by his actions that he had forgiven her . for during the night fever supervened , and before morning she died . her hot hand had lain in his , just before her heart ceased to beat . and had pressed it , as if in farewell , [female] followed her darling 's [female] wife shortly afterwards . her death was a peaceful and happy one , for [female] held her withered hand .
there he filled his pockets with small white pebbles . and then returned home , they set out all together , and little [male] said not a word to his brothers of what he had overheard . they entered a very thick forest , wherein , at ten paces distant . they could not see one another , the woodcutter began to cut wood . and the children to pick up brushwood for the faggots .
the sphinx is represented , according to greek genealogy , as the offspring of typhon and [female] . [female] , being upon one occasion displeased with the thebans . sent them this awful monster , as a punishment for their offences . taking her seat on a rocky eminence near the city of thebes . commanding a pass which the thebans were compelled to traverse in their usual way of business .
so they wandered and they wandered , more and more hungry all the time . till they came to a glade in which there was a funny little house . and what do you think it was made of ? the door was made of butter scotch . the windows of sugar candy . the bricks were all chocolate creams .
the desire to suppress the scandal this adventure might create . the intention to implore [female] to endeavour to stifle a passion which was so perilous to them . the pity naturally awakened by so affecting an object , -- everything , in short . conspired to arrest her flight , she approached the prince . her presence suspended his fury , he let fall his sword at the feet of the princess .
when the captain and lieutenant got home with the princesses you may be sure there were great rejoicings at the palace . the king was so glad he did not know which leg to stand on . he brought out his best wine from his cupboard and wished the two officers welcome . if they had never been honoured before they were honoured now in full measure . and no mistake , they walked and strutted about the whole of the day .
in the long run he decided to hold on his way . and let things go as they liked , what he had expected happened . the king received his sister and wedded her at once , but repented it after the first night . as he could scarcely put down his foot in the morning for all the toads that were about the room . and when he saw her real face he was so enraged against the brother that he had him thrown into a pit full of serpents .
some poor little girls were playing in the field , their feet were bare and their faded frocks were torn . but they danced and sang too , there came a rumbling like thunder . and through a gap in the hawthorn hedge the children and the daisies saw the king 's little daughter driven past in her great scarlet coach drawn by eight dappled horses . they could see the little princess sitting up very straight with her crinoline puffing about her and her crown on her head . and after she had passed all the children played that they were princesses .
but he had no sooner partaken of the heavenly food than . to the amazement of the goddess , he burst asunder the bands which confined his infant limbs . and springing to his feet , appeared before her as a full grown youth of divine strength and beauty . he now demanded a lyre and a bow . declaring that henceforth he would announce to mankind the will of his father [male] .
`` tub , tub , tub , '' said the ribbons of colors as [female] pounded up against the molten copper with the stone in her extended hand . `` slip , slip , slip , slip , '' quickly answered pip i ' , because the moon was spanking back the many little rounded domes which the stone bulged forth on the outer surface of the vessel .
dresses , with their guide , each carrying a lighted fir torch . appeared at the bottom , and disappeared again in one of the dark holes , from within the dark wooden houses . in which great water wheels turned , issued some of the workmen , they came from the dizzying gulf . from narrow , deep wells : they stood in their wooden shoes two and two . on the edge of the tun which , attached to heavy chains .
or , is that other illustration more remarkable , where the wanderer is amongst the alps . at the brink of a hideous chasm ; and seeing in the contorted pine branches the ever haunting scene of the via dolorosa . he is lured to cast himself into that [location] in [male] of rest . when an angel flashes out of the gloom with the sword of flame turning every way . keeping him back from what would be to him a paradise indeed .
in this way nonsense is made of the whole retrospect . and the ethnological scheme remains so vague and shadowy that it fails to displace crude conceptions of mankind 's beginning which still dominate religious thinking . and keep back the spiritual progress of the age , the decadence and ultimate disappearance of atlantean civilisation is in turn as instructive as its rise and glory . but i have now accomplished the main purpose with which i sought leave to introduce the work now before the world . with a brief prefatory explanation , and if its contents fail to convey a sense of its importance to any listeners i am now addressing .
so the prince came a good deal closer . and they sat watching the frantic efforts of [male] to get at them . but it was no use , suddenly , however , he changed his mode of attack . he made his dragon fly high into the air—so high indeed that it would have been invisible if its golden coat had not shone brightly in the sun . it was quite unpleasant to look at him , for he was so high up that it made them feel dizzy as it shone out against the sky , miles high .
it was broad daylight when the robbers reached their cave . the bundles were laid in a great circle on the floor . and , at a given signal , they were opened , for a moment each robber gazed blankly at the contents of his bundle . and then they all began to fumble and search among the piles of articles upon the cloths . but after a few minutes , they arose , looking blanker and more disappointed than before .
flattered by [female] 's speeches , the dwarfs who were in the forge took up the bar of fine gold and flung it into the fire . then taking it out and putting it upon their anvil they worked on the bar with their tiny hammers until they beat it into threads that were as fine as the hairs of one 's head . but that was not enough , they had to be as fine as the hairs on [male] 's head . and these were finer than anything else , they worked on the threads . over and over again , until they were as fine as the hairs on [male] 's head .
at the end of the four days , he invited them to gather together all of their arrows . and to accompany him to a buffalo hunt . when they got out upon the prairie , they found it covered with a great herd of buffaloes . of these they killed as many as they pleased , and , afterward , they had a grand festival in honor of white feather 's triumph over the giants . all this being pleasantly over , white feather got his wife to ask her father 's permission to go with him on a visit to his grandfather .
now mr. [male] was one of the kindest men in [location] . he sent at once to have the horse put to the brougham . took diamond with him , and drove to the children 's hospital . there he was well known to everybody , for he was not only a large subscriber . but he used to go and tell the children stories of an afternoon .
on the death of a parent , the mourning clothes worn are made of coarse hempen cloth . and during the whole period of mourning these must be worn night and day . as the burial of his parents is the most important ceremony which a man has to go through during his whole life . when the occasion comes , in order that there be no confusion . he must employ some person to teach him the usual and proper rites .
`` i have no little [male] to shelter now , and you can come in here , '' said a soft voice above him ; and looking up , [male] saw that he was under the rose tree where the dead [male] hung broken on its stem . soon the sun shone again and [female] came to find her friend . but he was ashamed to meet her and stole away , when the flowers told [female] all the harm [female] had done she was very sorrowful . and tried to comfort them , she cured the hurt birds and butterflies .
when he reached the river he paused and looked round for a moment to make sure that the strange feeling of some one watching him was fancy . and he was really alone , but the moon shone brightly on every tree . and nothing was to be seen but his own shadow ; nothing was to be heard but the sound of the rippling stream . he threw off his clothes , and was just about to dive in headlong . when something -- he did not know what -- suddenly caused him to look round .
i have already informed you , beautiful princess . that i had been unable to obtain from the fairy permission to seek the queen , my mother . the desire she now had to receive her sanction . which she never doubted she should obtain , obliged her to grant . even without my asking , that which she had always denied me .
that night will took a dummy man and propped it up on a [male] . which he put up to the lord 's bedroom . and when the lord saw the dummy coming in at the window he shot his pistol at it and it fell down . he rushed downstairs and out into the open air looking to see if he had shot will . meanwhile will went up to the lord 's bedroom and , speaking in the lord 's voice .
long afterwards , even to this day , when any who knew her witness a kind action . or meet one with a cheerful , hopeful spirit , and a sunny smile . they say , `` it is just like violet . '' it was a snowy night , and the children . as we gathered around the fire , began to ask for stories .
while little [male] was looking at the kings , the shepherds and the manger . his godmother found a nice , large easter egg that was all hollow and gaily painted in red and yellow . with a pin she pricked out a door on one side . and on the other , two windows ; then she set the egg firmly in the earth . under the tree and told him this would be his home and that he should carry some earth inside .
the amphibious monsters and the gigantic tree ferns of the permian age still flourished in the warm damp climates . [organization] and [male] in the tepid marshes of the mesolithic epoch . but , with the drying up of many of the inland seas , the dinosauria . the monstrous land reptiles -- gradually became the dominant type . while the pterodactyls -- the saurians which developed bat like wings .
now what happened you will learn by and by ; meanwhile , [female] 's three brothers waited for her return . but long they waited , and longer still , and she came not back again . they sought her east . they sought her west , they sought her up and down . and woe were the hearts of her brethren , since she was not to be found .
[female] alighted from his horse , and , putting on his invisible coat . approached and aimed a blow at the giant 's head . but missing his aim he only cut off his nose . on this the giant seized his club and laid about him most unmercifully . `` nay , '' said [male] , `` if this be the case i would better dispatch you ! ''
he followed her at a distance as she went . having left his drum at the lodge , with a great bird tied at the top . whose fluttering wings should keep up the drumbeat , the same as if he were standing there beating the drum himself . he saw the old workman busy . and learned how he prepared the heads ; he also beheld the old man 's daughter .
his prayer book lay opened upon his mouth , and his hat was pulled down so as to cover it and his face . it is unnecessary to say that the rumour of his death . and of the circumstances under which he left home . created a most extraordinary sensation in the country -- a sensation that was the greater in proportion to the uncertainty occasioned by his not having been found either alive or dead . some affirmed that he had crossed the mountains , and was seen in monaghan .
thus disguised he set out for the kingdom where the princess lived . all he took with him were four loaves of bread to eat on the way . he had not gone far before he met a beggar who begged him . in god 's name , for a piece of bread . the prince at once gave him one of the four loaves .
on his death , the young prince , [male] viii. . succeeded him , and he seems to have had an innate taste for hunting . and soon made up for lost time and the privation to which his father had subjected him . he hunted daily , and generously allowed the nobles to do the same , it is scarcely necessary to say that these were not slow in indulging in the privilege thus restored to them . and which was one of their most ancient pastimes and occupations ; for it must be remembered that .
she begged for [female] , but the sun god would not forgive her until she had clothed herself in a black blanket . plucked a stick out of the eaves , and had gone outside the town and there thrown the stick and the hair over her left shoulder . then the sun god recovered his good humour , and finished his dinner . and the brahman , the king and queen . and the wood cutter and the farmer whose well had dried up .
[female] i looked about him . all the jewels known to earth were there in abundance , the columns were of white quartz . inlaid with green [male] ; the seats were made of [male] . the curtains of mountain crystal as clear as water . the windows of burnished glass , adorned with rich lattice work .
thus it happened that [male] lost his patron . so , taking his mother with him , he went and placed himself under the [male] of an old man named [male] jiuzayémon . this old man was a famous teacher of lance exercise . and enjoyed both wealth and honour ; so he took in [male] . and having engaged as a guard thirty ronins .
and then one day , when the fine gentleman had ridden far away to the town to buy a new bracelet for [female] . there came an old witch , ugly she was , with only one tooth in her head . and wicked as ever went about the world doing evil to decent folk , she begged from [female] . and said she was hungry , and [female] begged her to share her dinner . and she put a spell in the wine that [female] drank .
i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister . i did not , indeed , anticipate that i should involve either of them in [male] of any kind , on your sister 's side . at least , i was never able to discover any symptoms of peculiar regard for mr. [male] . while , for every reason , i must rejoice in my success with my friend .
there were once two brothers who both served as soldiers ; one of them was rich . and the other poor , then the poor one , to escape from his poverty . put off his soldier 's coat , and turned farmer . he dug and hoed his bit of land . and sowed it with turnip seed , the seed came up .
madam , to obey your commands , and to shew you by what strange accident i became blind of the right eye . i must of necessity give you the account of my life . i was scarcely past my infancy , when the sultan my father ( for you must know i am a prince by birth ) . perceived that i was endowed with good natural ability , and spared nothing proper for improving it . no sooner was i able to read and write , but i learned the koraun from beginning to end by heart .
one day , a few months after meeting the little people . a strange man brought a horse to be shod , nobody knew either the horse or the man . the old blacksmith tied the horse to a hole in the lip of a cauldron ( used for the purpose of cooling his hot iron ) . that he had built in some masonry , when he had tied the horse up he went to shoe the off hind leg . but directly he touched the horse the spirited animal started back with a bound .
`` what is it anyway ? '' demanded [male] , looking suspiciously at the magic volume . there were none , both boys were through the door and downstairs before he had finished the question . [male] fled in terror before that frightful apparition . and [male] went to bring [male] back , -- but he didn t think of that good reason till afterwards .
but the shrimps did not know about [female] , either , they were not very clever . you know , and had not gone to school , won t you please tell us ? said [male] , a bit ruffled at the [male] 's airs . [male] is the king of the deep sea ! shouted all the fairies together , so loudly that the [male] ships rocked with the noise .
what does she want with ours ? if we allow her to come here . we shall suffer for it some day . but the other sisters would answer , be quiet , [female] ; why must you always be quarreling with this poor woman ? let her take some fire if she likes . then the purdan 's widow used to go to the hearth and take a few sticks from it .
just at that moment a raging hurricane , such as had never been seen or heard before . passed by and fell upon the garden , it roared and whistled round and round . then seizing the princess carried her far away , the terrified governesses wrung their hands . and were for a time speechless with grief . at last they rushed into the palace , and throwing themselves on their knees before the king and queen .
to such sweet music did they sing the songs or ballads which they made or perchance had heard . to such sweet music , that those who listened could forget nor tale nor tune . in those far-off days of minstrelsy the country was alive with fairies . over the mountains , through the glens , by babbling streams and across silent moors . the patter of tiny feet might be heard , feet which had strayed from elfinland .
her child , her little son , was under the heavy wheels , crunch , crunch ! and it had gone by , the horrible waggon , [female] went on to the horse road . and her little heart was very full ; for there , where poor [female] had been lying . there was only some yellowish crunched stone , [female] had been ground into powder by the huge wheels . the poor child was in despair , and , with tears in her eyes .
it was funny to see how deft the mother was with her needles . fashioned from bone , and her rough thread , which was made of the intestines of the deer . from her own childhood in the woods , [female] 's mother had been used to this kind of dressmaking . now , when her daughter had grown , from babyhood and through her teens . to be a lovely [female] , fair of face and strong of limb .
there was once a fairy who took a great fancy to a tiny white lamb . he really was a dear little creature , and i [female] t wonder she fell in love with him . she used often to come and visit him in the meadow where he lived with his mother . and she was very anxious to take him to a fairy party some evening .
the fourth sister was not so brave ; she stayed in the remotest part of the ocean . and , according to her account , that was the most beautiful spot , you could see for miles and miles around you . and the sky above was like a great glass dome . she had seen ships , but only far away , so that they looked like sea gulls . there were grotesque dolphins turning somersaults , and gigantic whales squirting water through their nostrils like hundreds of fountains on every side .
in an instant a tiny hummingbird , shining like a jewel . alighted at her feet , she sprang on his back . and away they flew to the golden clouds in the west where the queen of the air fairies held her court . and when the queen and all her fairies saw butterfly 's dirty brown wings . they waved their wands and vanished , and little butterfly was left alone in the palace of the air .
he stayed there all night , but there was not a word in the book about the blue mountains . seeing that he was rather cast down , the old man told him that he had a brother nine hundred miles away . and that if information could be got about them from anyone it would be from him . `` and i will enable you , '' he said . `` to reach the place where he lives before night . ''
[male] says , in the preface to his book . to unite elegance and utility , and blend the useful with the agreeable , has ever been considered a difficult . but an honorable task , he sometimes failed and sometimes succeeded , his knowledge of construction enabled him to make his chairs with shield . oval , and heart-shaped backs , the tops were slightly curved . also the tops of the splats , and at the lower edge where the back and the splat join .
the library should have plenty of comfortable sofas and chairs . and a large table ( it is hard to get one too large ) , some of the bookcases should be built in to form part of the architectural plan of the room . and personally i think it is a better idea to have all the space intended for bookcases built in in the first place . as this insures harmony of plan , another important thing in a library is to have the lights precisely right . and the window seats and the fireplace should be all that their names imply in the way of added charm and comfort to the room .
oh , how glad they all were to be together again , and when the wind whistled through the forest . and the snow stood in great banks round the door . the father used to take the little boy on his knee and tell him how he caught [male] in the land of the sun . `` mother , i have seen such a wonderful man , '' said a little boy one day , as he entered a hut in lapland .
' what has his highness ordered for luncheon ? asked the head cook . and now [male] was allowed to try his hand , he could not nearly reach up to the kitchen range . but by putting a wide plank on two chairs he managed very well . all the cooks stood round to look on , and could not help admiring the quick . clever way in which he set to work , at last , when all was ready .

the father did not dare to sit in this gorgeous coach , but went to the palace on foot . the king and his daughter were immensely surprised with the beauty of the carriage . and mounted the steps at once to go to [male] 's banquet . then [male] rubbed his watch afresh . and wished that for six miles the way to the house should be paved with marble .
elsewhere i would forget it lightly enough , as soon as ever i left the cabin . at the saloon table , where plate and cup fretted themselves up and down against the table frames . in the skipper 's basket lounge chair wherein i read contrasted romances . east end and zulu , on the deck where i groped from hold by to hold by . longing to change grey sky and green sea trenches for [male] and blue levels of sea and sky .
but he only answered by dropping another nut from directly over her head . and she followed him into the wood . the beautiful , cool , still wood . violet left off singing as she entered it . for she loved to hear the rustle of the ripe leaves .
from the very day of the wedding the step mother and her daughters took a violent dislike to the young girl . for they could see how beautiful she was , both outwardly and inwardly ; and green envy soon turns to hate . they dared not show it openly , for fear of the father 's anger . but he , poor man , finding he had taken too heavy a burden upon his shoulders . fell ill and died , -- simply worried into his grave , then his young daughter reaped the full measure of jealousy and spite and malice which her step mother and sisters could now openly bestow upon her .
if in the evening he sat in the theatre to enjoy himself thoroughly . he would be quite put out if the machinist had put too strong a light into one side of the moon . or if the sky pieces hung down over the scenes when they ought to have hung behind them . or when a palm tree was introduced into a scene representing the berlin zoological gardens . or a cactus in a view of the tyrol .
one must never wander about alone on hallowe en , for then the fairies are abroad looking for mortals to trick and lead astray . now , there was once a girl , the prettiest girl in all [female] . who late one hallowe en was going to a spring to fetch some water . her foot slipped , and she fell , when she got up . she looked about her , and saw that she was in a very strange place .
[female] , who was supposed to know all about it , said that he had not done it . but nobody believed him , little by little the lights died out . and then it was time to go home to bed . [male] was quite sleepy , and was very glad to find his head resting on a soft pillow . after he had said his prayers and said `` good night , ''
`` oh , i will do that , of course , miss , '' said the delighted maid , and ran away to spend the afternoon with her friend . leaving [female] quite alone in the big house , and locked in , into the bargain . the little girl read a few pages in her new book . sewed a few stitches in her embroidery and started to `` play visiting '' with her four favorite dolls .
when the cat got his boots , he drew them on with a grand air . and slinging his sack over his shoulder , and drawing the cords of it round his neck . he marched bravely to a rabbit warren hard by , with which he was well acquainted . then , putting some [male] and lettuces into his bag . and stretching himself out beside it as if he were dead .
come with [location] into the large woody desert . we have a regular trodden way to travel , the air is clear . here is summer 's warmth and the fragrance of [female] and lime . it is an up and down hill road , always bending . and so , ever changing , but yet always forest scenery -- the close , thick forest .
some of them , therefore , advised that the coffin should be immediately committed to the deep . but to this proposal [male] , the deceased 's brother . would not consent , he was sitting in the stern of the boat . and his late sister 's spirit drew so near to him that she could put her hand on his shoulder . he chanced to have a bunch of keys in his pocket .
was , in spite of her ragged clothes , a lady of high degree . so , affecting to treat the poor couple with respect , he offered them gold and treasure if the knight would renounce christianity and consent to fight under the saracen banners . this offer was at once declined , and the angry king made up his mind to revenge himself by carrying away the knight 's wife . so , upon an order to the attendants , a purse of gold was pressed into the knight 's hand . his infant son was put into his arms , he was hurried ashore .
he had not had one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest . and his wife was dead , [female] shook her apron . and the pearls and precious stones rolled out upon the floor . and [male] threw down one handful after the other out of his pocket . then all their sorrows were ended , and they lived together in great happiness .
but there is one class of stories in which the vyed'ma is represented as differing from the [female] . in so far as she is the offspring of parents who are not in any way supernatural or inhuman . without any apparent cause for her abnormal conduct , the daughter of an ordinary royal house will suddenly begin to destroy and devour all living things which fall in her way . her strength developing as rapidly as her appetite . of such a nature -- to be accounted for only on the supposition that an evil spirit has taken up its abode in a human body .
`` hurrah , '' he cried , `` at last i can hear the princess cry ! '' and he burst open the door and ran into the room . all in his rags and his tatters , and knelt down to comfort the king 's daughter . `` only look at my finger , '' wept princess [female] . as she showed him her little hand .
`` how did you escape ? '' i repeated to them what i have just told you . at which they were mightily astonished , i stayed with them until they had collected as much pepper as they wished . and then they took me back to their own country and presented me to their king . by whom i was hospitably received , to him also i had to relate my adventures . which surprised him much , and when i had finished he ordered that i should be supplied with food and raiment and treated with consideration .
so they went first to the stationery store ( which , just as [female] had said . was in the usual place ) , and then to a bazaar where they disposed of their household buying . while [female] was feasting her eyes on the strange , delicious-looking fruits . the old candlesticks , and the bolts and lengths of rich looking cloth with stories woven into it . she heard [female] say , `` now a set of self buttoning [female] , please . ''
as soon as he awoke , he wandered again through the palace until he came to a room . from the window of which he saw the most beautiful garden he had ever beheld . and it came into his mind to go for a walk in it . then he went out of the palace and strolled about for a long time . and at length came to a stone wall .
but that which brought [female] more closely home to the hearts of the people . and raised the whole moral tone of the greek nation , was the belief . gradually developed with the intelligence of the people , that he was the god who accepted repentance as an atonement for sin . who pardoned the contrite sinner , and who acted as the special protector of those . who , like [male] , had committed a crime , which required long years of expiation .
on went the fish , and on went [female] , till they reached the shore . near the magician 's lodge , he then spoke kindly to the sturgeon and told him he should not be angry at having been speared . as he was created to be meat for man . the sturgeon made no reply , or if he did . it has not been reported ; and [male] , drawing the fish on shore .
and he twinkled at the stern , young eyes that gazed on him as he made his submission . there are people who do not like dogs a bit . they are usually women -- but in this story there is a man who did not like dogs . in fact , he hated them . when he saw one he used to go black in the face .
there was a light burning , and the goblin peeped through the key hole and saw that he was reading the torn book that he had bought in the shop . but how bright it was , out of the book shot a streak of light which grew into a large tree and spread its branches far above the student . every leaf was alive , and every flower was a beautiful girl 's head . some with dark and shining eyes , others with wonderful blue ones . every fruit was a glittering star , and there was a [female] music in the student 's room .
confident as the blind girl had been when she asked the question . her delight and pride in the reply . and her renewed embrace of dot , were charming to behold , [female] wondered what this meant . perceiving that she spoke to him , no less than to his daughter . he saw her , with astonishment .
it is true they lived in a cellar . a yard or so below ground : one had to go through a paved front room to come into the room they lived in . but it was warm here , for there was list round the door to keep it so . it looked clean and neat , with curtains round the bed and over the small windows . where two strange-looking flowerpots stood on the sill , [male] , the sailor .
now not far from the lady 's house there was a pasture . and in this pasture there was a bull , -- a fine , handsome animal . [male] often saw it there , after a while jean began to notice a curious thing . whenever mr. [male] came to the house , which was almost every day . the bull disappeared from the pasture , and whenever the bull was in the pasture there was nothing to be seen of the gentleman .
now [female] , a prince and the most famous hunter in the kingdom . had come in his boat down the river that ran through the haunted wood . with him he had brought many servants and his pack of trained leopards . with which he hunted , and which were swifter and had keener scent than any dogs . possibly [male] had never heard of this forest , or it may have been that he became so excited when the leopards started on their wild chase that he forgot to be afraid of goblins .
the question was , how to do it ? inquiry before the magistrates appeared useless . for if two constables , and one of them a smeeth man . too , could not even approach the crones dwelling , of what avail was it to invoke the authority of the law ? the church might be tried , but the rector of mersham was known to have steadily set his face against any belief in witches . and it was more than probable that no other clergyman would like to interfere in his parish without his knowledge and consent .
the duchess then told him that she had sent out men in all directions to look for the children directly they were found to be missing . and that one of them had noticed a troop of little men far away on the mountains . evidently carrying a litter , he was hastening after them . when , at his feet , he beheld a tiny satin slipper . which he stooped to pick up , but as he did so a dozen of the gnomes had swarmed upon him like flies .
then the second was lowered in his turn ; but he also begin to cry as had the former . and was drawn out , now it was the turn of the youngest brother . who said : let me down , and the more i cry , i am burning ! i am roasting , the further let me descend , so they did . and the more he cried , the more they let him descend .
in its rays he could see the nest with the young eaglets . who were watching him over the side , the prince fitted an arrow into his bow and took his aim . but , before he could let fly , another [male] of light dazzled him . so brilliant was it , that his bow dropped . and he covered his face with his hands .
but what did the youth see ? ere long one swarm after another returned , each bringing news that the drove could not be found on the surface of the earth and must have hidden somewhere in the sea . the sun was about to rise , the poor boy took the fish scale , rubbed it . and suddenly there appeared in the springs at his feet a school of tiny fish . that filled every channel , and asked what were his wishes and commands . he told them what he desired and instantly all the waters on the earth .
the eighteen aunts sat at the upper end of the board . the maids followed , and the scholar sat down with them at the lowest place . soon the entire table was covered with the most delicious foods and most magnificent fruits . and the goblets were filled with a fragrant nectar , they were delights such as the world of men does not know ! the moon shone brightly and the flowers exhaled intoxicating odors .
scarcely had she conceived the wish , when a faint sound from far away struck upon her ears . as she listened , it grew louder and louder , and nearer and nearer . until at last she knew it was the roar of the fire bird 's wings . she ran out onto the balcony , and there she saw it . like a meteor in the sky , every moment growing bigger .
thus they for a time lived happily and safely , and the widow found her visitors no encumbrance . for [male] exerted himself with such good will in hunting and fishing that he supplied more than sufficient for them all . the boy grew a strong , sturdy fellow ; and [male] . by good nourishment and mind at ease as to the safety of herself and charge . expanded into a most lovely woman , as amiable as she was beautiful , and assisted the widow in all her household duties .
so next day the two younger went out to seek , and the eldest had to stay home . at midday came a small , small [male] and begged for a piece of bread . then the huntsman took the bread which he had found there . and cut a round off the loaf and was about to give it to him . but whilst he was giving it to the [male] .
now the little kitchen maid lifted the prince 's gold broidered saddle from its perch . and the weight of it was such that she could not have carried it but for the heavy heart she bore because of her love to the prince and his danger . and that made all else seem light , she put the saddle on the charger . and the jewelled bridle , and he neighed with pleasure . for he understood , being a horse who could see as far into a stone wall as most people .
[female] tried to get out , but in vain , the tree was too smooth and slippery and high for him to be able to clamber up . and he only hurt himself every time he attempted to escape . there was nothing for it , then , but for him to lie down and howl . he had to satisfy his hunger as best he might . by eating the stray worms and woodlice and fungi .
the prince married [male] the very next day and [female] was the very happiest girl in all the world . for from the first moment that she had seen the prince . she had known that he was the one above all others whom she wished to marry . there was no escape for [female] , she had to remain in the form of a sea serpent because of [female] 's neglect . she had lost her chance to come out of the sea and become a lovely princess herself and find a charming prince of her own .
the morning air was sweet with all manner of herbage yet fresh from the morning dew . the trees were in their most brilliant green , and every leaf seemed newly washed . [female] began a boating song . and miss [female] joined in the chorus , old [female] chuckled and grinned . even quiet [male] hummed a little as the song rose louder .
but fairest [male] saw him from the highest idalian peak . and she pitied his youth and his beauty . and leapt up from her golden throne ; and like a falling star she cleft the sky . and left a trail of glittering light , till she stooped to the isle of the sirens . and snatched their prey from their claws , and she lifted butes as he lay sleeping .
the name glittered in gas jets over the entrance . it was `` mabille , '' the soaring upwards of rockets . the splashing of fountains , and the popping of champagne corks accompanied the wild bacchantic dance . over the whole glided the moon through the air . clear , but with a somewhat crooked face , the moon shone bright .
it is true that no one ever heard a word of complaint against his son pass his lips . indeed it was certain that to the very last he was well acquainted with his son 's whereabouts . for when he was asked for news , he answered at first . `` he is finishing his studies in [location] , '' later : -- he seems to have found in padua what he is seeking ,
when the prince had eaten and drunk , he set off . and soon came to a forest , and sure enough it was full of lions and tigers . and bears and wolves , who came rushing towards him . but instead of springing on him and tearing him to pieces . they lay down on the ground and licked his hands .
`` am i ? '' returned the puzzled [male] , and , rising , he heard strains of music . and knew that the band was playing , as it always does on the awaking of a king in the morning . all day [male] reigned as king . but when night came , the servants , who had been instructed what to do by the real king . once more put sleeping powder into his wine .
he made a struggle to crawl from his straw bed . opened the casement , and out flew the bird , a flight of jackdaws from the temple were going over the jail . and [male] bird mixed among them , the gardener was then laying the plats of the temple gardens . and as often as he placed them in the day the jackdaws pulled them up by night . they got a gun and attempted to shoot some of them .
the queen sat stunned and motionless . but the boat at once shot away from the ship with her . and before long she was out of sight , they soon reached the land which [female] was to rule over . and found all the people sorrowful for the old king 's death . but they became glad when they got [male] back to the court .
as for the floating farm , the cows could not understand it . they mooed piteously , while the donkey brayed loudly , at night , and day after day . no one could attend properly to the animals , to see that they were fed and given water . one always sees a big tub in the middle of a dutch pasture field . neither ducks , nor geese , nor chickens minded it in the least .
he made the best of his way towards it . and found that it came from a splendid palace , the windows of which were all blazing with light . it had great bronze gates . standing wide open , and fine court yards , through which the merchant passed ; but not a living soul was to be seen . there were stables too , which his poor , starved horse , less scrupulous than himself .
the oldest of the farmer 's sons was a soldier . and had served in the wars , where there was always much laughter , and he said that it would not be worth while for his two brothers to plan to journey to the court . because he intended to win the princess that very first day . so the schoolmaster also went home with a very sore back ; and when the third brother . whose name was [male] , because he sat in the ashes and made tapers out of fir .
they therefore made the best of their way home . and while they were telling the adventure to the colonel . young [male] , who happened to be at woodbourne , courageously offered to follow after . to see that no harm came to [male] and his former antagonist . [male] merrilies led them through the wood of warroch .
but while the duke and the officers were eating and drinking . there was more or less talk , and the duke learned that the king had a daughter . as yet unmarried and so lovely that her like had never been seen , and the more they brought the king 's officers to eat . the stronger they inclined to the opinion that the king 's daughter would make a good wife for the duke . and as they talked about it , the duke himself began to think it over .
a strange whirring noise was heard , then a loud clang . and the next moment the bell punch , as if it were alive . flew out of his hand , out of the window , and was gone , poor [male] ! he had opened his lips to say , thank you , papa . i should like to go very much , and , instead of these words .
`` i see i must make a regular attack on these things , '' said he . and he accordingly did not spare them , but while looking for the truth . came the evil one , the father of lies , to intercept him . gladly would the fiend have plucked out the eyes of this seer . but that would have been a too straightforward path for him ; he works more cunningly .
when the king read the letter he was shocked and much troubled . but he wrote in answer that they were to take great care of the queen and nurse her well until his arrival . the messenger went back with the letter , but rested at the same place and again fell asleep . then came the devil once more , and put a different letter in his pocket . in which it was written that they were to put the queen and her child to death .
the story of the girl who trod on the loaf . to avoid soiling her shoes , and of the misfortunes that befell this girl . is well known , it has been written , and even printed , the girl 's name was [female] . she was a poor child , but proud and presumptuous ; there was a bad foundation in her . as the saying is , when she was quite a little child .
so the lion was called the king of beasts . and the crowned rulers and knights took him as their emblem . they had pictures of the huge creature painted on their flags . shields and armor , sometimes they stuck a gold or brass lion on their iron war hats . which they called helmets , no knight was allowed to have more than one lion on his shield .
it was a bitterly cold morning ; clouds of mist were rising from beneath . and [female] stood on the lower step of the [female] as a fly rests on a piece of swinging straw . which a bird may have dropped from the edge of the nest it was building on some tall factory chimney . but the fly could fly away if the straw were shaken , [male] could only break his neck . the wind whistled around him , and beneath him the waters of the abyss .
arrived at sparta they beheld , in the temple of [female] . [female] , the daughter of [female] and [female] . who was engaged in performing sacred dances in honour of the goddess . although the [female] was only nine years old the fame of her beauty . which was destined to play so important a part in the history of [female] .
then the horrid things crept away from the morning light . chuckling to themselves over the funeral of the moon . and only wishing they could bury the sun in the same way . but that was a little too much to hope for , and besides , all respectable horrors of the bog ought to be asleep in bed during the sun 's journey across the sky . the poor moon was now buried deep in the black mud .
spirit iron took a long draught , and immediately left the lodge with his eyes wide open . for this was the drink which teaches one to see the truth of things as they are . he rose up when he got into the open air . stood upon his hind legs , and looked about , i see how it is , ', he said . and marching off , erect as a man , he sought out his young master .
seeing fair speech was of no avail , [male] told [male] to go down a little . out of the way ; and , setting his shoulders to one end of the stone . heaved it up ; whereupon down came the other end , with a pot . and a fire , and a cat which had been asleep beside it . she frightened [female] dreadfully as she rushed past her .
he shed tears of pity to see that his brother had laid aside the arms of a hunter . and that he was beating corn with the women . indifferent to the fate and the fortune of his lost wife . [male] ascertained that his brother 's wife had passed on to a country beyond . after deliberating for a time , and spending several days in a severe fast .
now , let me see , in the last story we left little [male] . junior , in the house of the old man who brought his wife home in a wheelbarrow . well , [male] heard him take off his shoes and get into bed . and then out went the light , i guess the old man leaned out of bed and blew it out . but [male] did not go to bed , oh , my , no , he slipped off his red topped boots .
pigs tails , similar to those worn from the hair . are also worn by both men and women , especially the latter , suspended from the ears . and here again they vary much in length , and are often decorated with tassel like hanging ornaments of shells . beads , etc , forehead ornaments are made by men and worn by them at dances . this ornament is a band , very slightly curved , which is worn across the forehead .
alphege threw himself into his arms . and the brothers hastened to the royal palace . where in the presence of the entire court he received the crown from his brother 's hand . to clear away any possible doubt , he showed the [female] which the good queen had given him in his childhood . as they were gazing at it , it suddenly split with a loud noise .

on the night that you are going to catch them . before leaving the place carry the string from the nail heads to the door or window . let the door or window be closed within an inch . with the end of the string outside , after the place has been quiet for thirty minutes return to the door or window very quietly . and you will hear the rats feeding , pull the string .
the day that prince [male] was transformed into a stone she was counting over the pearls as she used to do . when all at once they became immovably fixed , a certain token that the prince . her brother , was dead , as she had determined what to do in case it should so happen . she lost no time in outward demonstrations of grief . which she concealed as much as possible , but having disguised herself in man 's apparel .
in planning a room the color values should be divided into the natural divisions of the heaviest . or darkest , part at the bottom , which is the floor . the medium color tone in the middle . which is the wall ; and the lightest at the top , which is the ceiling . this keeps the room from seeming top heavy and gives the necessary feeling of support for the wall and ceiling .
once upon a time there lived a poor man who had more children than bread to feed them with . however , they were strong and willing , and soon learned to make themselves of use to their father and mother . and when they were old enough they went out to service . and everyone was very glad to get them for servants . for they worked hard and were always cheerful , out of all the ten or eleven .
for the boy whistled and piped till he was hoarse . because she liked it , the last of the long hoarded cents came out of his tin bank to buy paper and pictures for the gay little books he made for her . his side of the wall was ravaged that hers might be adorned . and , as the last offering his grateful heart could give , he poked the toad through the hole . to live among the lilies and eat the flies that began to buzz about her highness when she came to give her orders to her devoted subjects .
immediately over this , on the outside of the tube , a narrow groove is cut at right angles to it . this piece of [male] becomes the stationary lower part of the fire machine . one edge of the other half of the original tube is sharpened like a chisel blade . this section is grasped in both hands , one at each end . and is at first slowly and heavily , afterwards more rapidly , drawn back and forth through the groove of the stationary [male] .
then the king set the diggers to work , he promised a rich reward to those men of the pick and shovel who should dig the fastest and throw up the most dirt . so that the masons could , at the earliest moment , begin their part of the work . but it all turned out differently from what the king expected , some dragon . or powerful being underground , must have been offended by this invasion of his domain . for , the next morning , they saw that everything in the form of stone .
then they fell to making a wonderful disturbance , the dragon 's voice was lifted in horrid howlings . and the young knight continually bawled with all his lungs , they chased as children in a game do . forward , back , and across to nowhere , knocking the barrels , clanking and clashing . up between the rows and around corners ; and the dry earth was ground under their feet and swept from the floor upward in a fine floating yellow powder that they sucked down into their windpipes . while still they hustled and jangled and banged and coughed and grew dripping wet , so the dust and the water mingled and ran black streams along their bodies from the neck downwards .
she further confessed that her mother told her to bring a piece of lady [female] 's . the [female] 's daughter 's -- kerchief , and her mother put it in hot water and taking it out rubbed it on [male] . `` bidding him fly and go , '' whereupon [male] whined and cried `` mew , '' and she said [male] had no power to hurt lady [male] . examined on the 25th of february , before [male] of rutland , [male] lord willoughby of eresby .
a man in islay got a loan of oatmeal from the fairies . and when returning it , he , out of gratitude . left at the hole , which led to the fairy residence . and where he had been in the habit of getting and leaving such loans . more meal than he had borrowed , the fairies are a just race .
on the day that prince [male] found and talked with princess white flame in the palace garden . flying soot passed near them on his way to the earth fairy 's prison . hearing their voices he drew near stealthily , and listened to them . as soon as prince [male] departed , away rushed the mischief maker to the earth fairy . it was the hour when the keeper was absent .
but a moment before it touched the horizon . where earth and heaven meet , the great white light from beyond had touched the sails . and made them gleam like angels ', wings . then ship and sails had settled into a lustrous invisibility . a long wave had broken with a hollow sound upon the shore .
`` who are you , little boy , and where do you come from ? '' they seemed to be saying ; and as they spoke all together their voices sounded exactly like the wind as we hear it in the pine trees . they were so [male] and kind looking that [male] was not a bit afraid and asked them at once to tell him the way to the wonderful toymaker who makes all the toys for fairyland . they were delighted to tell him all they knew . for it was their one secret and they were very proud of it .
then king [male] advanced , the mighty weight in his hand . to the verge of the dreadful gulf of the earthquaker . the dim walls grew radiant . a long slant arm of yellow light touched the black body of the earthquaker . and a thrill went through him , and shook the world .
the emperor , who saw they were as well mounted and dressed as if they had belonged to his court . had the curiosity to see their faces , he stopped , and commanded them to rise . the princes rose up , and stood before him with an easy and graceful air . accompanied with respectful modest countenances , the emperor took some time to view them before he spoke . and after he had admired their good air and mien .
as far as [male] was concerned , the intrusion appeared to him to be little less than providential . the princess could do nothing else than obey . and as it would not have been etiquette for her either to have invited him to accompany her . or told him to await her return , she had no alternative but to dismiss him from the apartment . this she did with a loving look , which certainly could not be misunderstood by its object .
' good [male] , what do you mean ? said the king and queen together . the king put his hand in his pocket . and drew out his purse and looked into it , so [male] kissed the king and queen . and watched them go down the garden walk to the carriage . and saw them get in , the guard of honour fired a royal salute .
at night there were extraordinary feastings at the palace . and the princess [female] was conducted to the princess [female] . whom every body took for a man , dressed like a royal bride . the wedding was solemnized with the utmost splendour : they were left together . and retired to bed , in the morning , while the princess [female] went to receive the compliments of the nobility in the hall of audience .
all windows over eighteen inches wide need two curtains , and the average allowance of fullness is at least twice the width of the window for net and any very soft material . while once and a half is usually enough for material with more body . great care must be taken to measure curtains correctly and have them cut evenly . it is also a good plan to allow for extra length . which can be folded into the top hem and will not show , but will allow for shrinking .
the prince had gone some way , when the king called after him . how he wished he had the seven league boots on . or that he had the cap of darkness in his pocket ! if he had been so lucky , he would now have got back to gluckstein . and crossed the border with lady [male] , a million of money may not seem much .
with such reassuring words did the daughter of the chief justice restore courage to the heart of her parent . and he began to look forward with less fear to the banquet at which it had been arranged that he should entertain his royal master . it was to be served in the large banqueting hall of his town house . and great preparations were set on foot for several days before that appointed for the festive gathering . but instead of busying herself about the matter , [female] treated it as if it was one wholly indifferent to her .
some time passed in all the usual delights of the flower fairy 's palace . and then she sent for [female] again , and told her she was to stay for a little while with the princess [female] . and accordingly the butterflies whisked her off , and set her down in quite a strange kingdom . but she had only been there a very little time before a wandering butterfly brought a message from her to the fairy . begging that she might be sent for as soon as possible , and before very long she was allowed to return .
the king smiled a contented smile , turned on his side . and was presently fast asleep , then [female] persuaded the princess also to go to sleep . and telling [male] to watch , went to the housemaid , he asked her if she could inform him which of the council slept in the palace . and show him their rooms , she knew every one of them . she said , and took him the round of all their doors .
so [female] and [female] [ sidenote . cool for the season. ] come home to their tea . and both are as hungry , as hungry can be , once there was a king who had a pear tree which bore four and twenty golden pears . every day he went into the garden and counted them to see that none were missing . but , one morning , he found that a pear had been taken during the night .
but it was left to [female] to undo at last the work of [male] . and give [male] back the youth he had lost . and this the genius did all the more gladly , as he discovered , quite by accident . that [male] was in fact his son . it was on this plea that he attended the great yearly meeting of the fairies .
in the circular whirlings of the ball by very rapid striking . entering , as it were , a flowery cage . through bashfulness at sight of me . in the panchavindhu movement shaking off , as if through fear , the five arrows of [female] simultaneously falling . in the gomuttrika steps quivering like the brightness shown in the cloud imitating forked lightning .
the next day the wedding took place . and the two brothers came to the house , and they all lived happily together . but they never forgot the holy man who had been such a good friend . three brothers and one sister lived together in a small cottage . and they loved one another dearly , one day the eldest brother .
and , in fact , as soon as it had recovered from its misadventure . the epeira renewed the broken threads with delicate dexterity . the darning finished , the damage could hardly be detected , the spider now takes its place in the center of the network . the right moment for the chase has come , apparently , and it is advisable for it to pounce upon the game as quickly as possible . to avoid other misadventures , it spreads its eight feet in a circle .
but they were obliged to go at last , and my father went with them . soon after , we heard the sound of firing , the noise continued . and presently soldiers rushed into our hut , and took my mother and myself and [female] prisoners . they declared that we had entertained robbers . and that my father had acted as their guide , and therefore we must now go with them .
they did not want to spend their little savings buying railway tickets . therefore they decided to go all the way on foot . which they never regretted , as it proved to be a remarkably beautiful journey . before they were out of småland , they stopped at a farm house to buy food . the housewife was a kind , motherly soul who took an interest in the children .
and i said : i will go from here by ways of dream and i will come to that valley and enter in and mourn there for the good years that are dead . and i said : i will take a wreath . a wreath of mourning , and lay it at their feet in token of my sorrow for their dooms . and when i sought about among the flowers , among the flowers for my wreath of mourning . the [person] looked too large and the laurel looked too solemn and i found nothing frail enough nor slender to serve as an offering to the years that were dead .
the roman nobles , heirs to their fathers agricultural dominions , succeeded for the most part in preserving through the successive invasions of the barbarians . the influence attached to the prestige of birth and wealth . they still possessed the greater part of the land and owned as vassals the rural populations . the [person] nobles , on the contrary , had not such extended landed properties .
so the little dog ran up to her , and dropped his bread at her feet . she picked it up , and ate it with avidity . soon she looked quite recovered , and [male] , delighted , was trotting back again to his kennel . when he heard loud cries , and saw a young girl dragged by four men to the door of the palace . which they were trying to compel her to enter , oh , how he wished himself a monster again .
so that , instead of dragging one foot after the other , as you do when you feel tired or naughty . you bounce along , and every time your feet touch the ground you bounce higher . and all without taking any trouble or tiring yourself , you have . perhaps , heard of the greek gentleman who got new strength every time he fell down . his name was [male] , and i believe he was an india rubber ball .
thais , but i , my poor friend , have drunk nothing but water . therefore you must excuse me if i do not love you . [male] did not wait to hear more , but made towards [male] . who had made a sign to him in order to get him away from her friend . [female] took the place he had left .
in a few minutes the frightened horse rushed by , in the wagon was a little old man . clinging tightly to the reins and with great difficulty keeping his horse in the middle of the road . in an instant [male] set off in pursuit , pretty soon his good gray horse drew close to the wagon . `` do not give up , '' cried [male] , `` hold on tight , '' the little old man did his best . but by this time his horse had become unmanageable and , turning suddenly to the right .
as the rocks were very steep and craggy , they were an insurmountable barrier . so that the magician judged that there were but two things for it . either that the prince retired into some cavern , or an abode of genies or fairies . thereupon she came out of the place where she was hid and went directly to the hollow way . which she traced till she came to the farther end .
sir [male] went back to the manor . conversing with [male] and his wife , and with the [male] . when they reached the house , they found it full of the servants of the [male] . who were sweeping the hall and laying straw therein , with tables and benches as were suitable . and soon a great fire leaped and crackled on the stone in the centre .
but one morning [female] sat on the front porch and wondered why the little boy had not come to the fence corner and called to him . the sun was high , the men had been long gone to the harvest fields . and the heat of the early autumn day had driven the birds to the thickest foliage of the trees . [male] could not understand why the little boy did not come ; he felt , oh ! so lonesome , and he yearned for the sound of a little voice calling `` goggie , goggie , goggie . ''
these practices , as well as many others , have no doubt been handed down to [location] from the early ages of christianity . the same may be said of a vast number of customs of a more or less local character . which have been observed in various countries for centuries , in former times . at ochsenbach , in [location] , during the carnival . women held a feast at which they were waited upon by men .
they went directly toward their foe , nowhere did they see anything that spoke of danger until they were but a stone 's throw from where the ash goblin knelt . there they stood still to scan his work , and beheld a delicate mesh . so thin and fine that it was well nigh invisible , stretching away to right and left of him and in front of him . before the prince could answer , the ash goblin rose . he had put the final touch to his work .
[male] , the king 's younger daughter . had accompanied her sister hither , and was here , as everywhere , the first . the most beautiful in the chase as well as at the tournament , the winter began directly on their arrival at vadstene . the cold was severe , and the vettern frozen over , one day . [female] rode out on the ice and it broke .
after she had eaten it , she felt comfortable . and sat for a long time building castles in the air . till she was actually hungry again , without having done an atom of work . she ate again , and was idle again , and ate again , then it grew dark . and she went [female] to bed .
a short while afterwards , a neighbouring king sent a message to say that a most lovely girl baby had been born to him . and he invited his neighbours to come to a great feast in honour of the occasion . the queen told her husband that of course they must be present at the banquet . and she would wear the new necklace which he had given her . they had only a short time to prepare for the journey .
she accordingly ordered the most curious fireworks to be played off in sight of the window of the apartment in which they were sitting . and nothing but festivity and rejoicing was heard throughout the palace for the prince 's return . as the white cat frequently gave proofs of an excellent understanding . the prince was by no means tired of her company . she talked with him of state affairs .
note : `` the magic cask '' is a traditionally narrated tale , in northern [location] wooden casks or barrels are unknown . large vessels , open at the top , of earth or stone are used to hold water and other liquids . once upon a time there was a proud prince who had a daughter . but the daughter was a child of ill luck .
the king , when he rode on horseback . frequently took [male] in his hand ; and , if a shower of rain came on . he used to creep into the king 's waist coat pocket . and sleep till the rain was over , the king also . sometimes questioned [male] concerning his parents ; and when [male] informed his majesty they were very poor people .
`` he may try them first , '' said the voice . and out from behind a stump jumped a little dwarf , dressed in green , with a red turban on his head . quick as a wink he fastened a wing to each foot of the good gray horse . and then he clicked his tongue against his teeth and away went the good gray horse up in the air like a great bird . `` hold on , '' shouted the dwarf , `` do not forget to give me the diamond , ''
presently he heard the sound of horses feet , which he concluded to be the robbers . who instantly put him to death , [male] drove to the forest . and on entering the cave , he found the body of his brother cut into quarters . he took the quarters , and put them upon one of his asses .
the last words were in a sharp whisper ; and [male] obeyed with a sudden [male] of the head that sent his curls over his eyes . and then laughed such a boyish laugh as he shook them back that the gentleman leaning forward to look at him joined in it . and the ladies smiled sympathetically as they pushed a dish of bonbons nearer to him . [male] gave him an indulgent look . and went on in the same benevolent tone telling all he meant to do .
the magician left the sultan , and , knowing the place where prince [male] found his arrow . went immediately thither , and hid herself near the rocks . so that nobody could see her , the next morning prince [female] set out by daybreak . without taking leave either of the sultan or any of his court , according to custom . the magician , seeing him coming , followed him with her eyes .
the above paragraph forms part of the notice with which the late dr. [person] . the eminent antiquarian , formerly at the head of this department of [organization] . has prefaced a catalogue of the antiquities alluded to , the visitor to the museum should be careful to procure one of these useful and inexpensive guides to this portion of its contents . some illustrations taken from ancient statues and bas reliefs in [organization] . from copies of wall paintings at thebes .
it was this event that was so much talked about , and which even got into the newspapers . but which the majority would not credit because they were not able to explain how anything like that could have happened . two days later , another strange thing happened , a flock of wild geese came flying one morning . and lit on a meadow down in [location] not very far from vittskövle manor . in the flock were thirteen wild geese , of the usual gray variety , and one white [male] .
it proved to be the latter , and the innkeeper , a severe sly looking man . received them with scanty welcome , indeed , he only admitted them because he remembered that it was in his power to fine them for the crime of travelling on a fast day by an addition to the length of his reckoning next morning . among the listeners there was somewhat less inclination than before to act this part of the story . for one thing , the boys were righteously indignant at the idea of any true hero being in love . unless , indeed , he could carry off his bride from the deck of a pirate vessel .
so the damsel took the bones of the king 's son . piled them up together , kissed the horse between the eyes . placed the bones on his saddle , and whispered in his ear . `` take these bones , my good steed , take them to the proper place. '' then the demon took the girl and led her back to the palace .
and twenty of the strongest fairies brought [male] 's hump and put it down upon poor [male] 's back . over his own , where it became fixed as firmly as if it was nailed on with twelve penny nails . by the best carpenter that ever drove one , out of their castle they then kicked him . and , in the morning , when [female] madden 's mother and her gossip came to look after their little man . they found him half dead .
terrified he looked at [male] , who still lay in unaltered beauty and [male] . then he would press a light kiss upon her rosy lips . and would fall asleep again only to be awakened by new terrors , after he had reflected on all this . now that he was fully awake , he reproached himself for any doubt that could have led him into error with regard to his beautiful wife . he begged her to forgive him for the injustice he had done her .
he gave me a great bag . and having recommended me to some people of the town . who were used to gather cocoa nuts , he desired them to take me with them to do the like . go , said he , follow them , and do as you see them do . and do not separate from them , otherwise you endanger your life .
would that each of [location] had a mr. [male] to keep [location] out of trouble ! there is an obligatory little romantic subplot , with a romance between dr. [female] 's seventeen year old daughter [female] and a noble young boarding student . lord carstairs , age eighteen years . are they too young for an engagement before he even enrolls at [male] ? will the young lord 's father lord bracy accept the daughter of a clergyman into his family ?
after which [female] , with her handkerchief , wiped the tears from the bitch 's eyes . kissed her , returned the chain to the porter . bid him carry her to the place whence he took her . and bring her the other , the porter led back the whipped bitch to the closet . and receiving the other from [female] , presented her to [female] .
with staring eyes , and mouth all agape with wonder and delight . [female] watched the curious process for a few moments . scarcely breathing audibly for fear of breaking the brilliant spell . what to do he did not know , heaps of the coveted jewels lay around within his very grasp . yet how to possess himself , without danger , of a few handfuls .
well , no one could deny that , so he was taken to another grand room in the palace and there he was washed and combed and dressed in fine clothes . and when that was done , he looked so brave and straight and handsome that the princess was glad enough to have him for a husband . they were married the next day , and a coach and four were sent to bring the old mother to the wedding . when she came and saw her own son , [male] , dressed in that way and holding a royal princess by the hand . she could hardly believe her eyes , and almost died of joy as the princess had of laughing .
at last he climbed up a turret stair in the very oldest part of the castle . where he had never been before ; and at the very top was a little round room . a kind of garret , the prince pushed in the door with some difficulty . not that it was locked , but the handle was rusty , and the wood had swollen with the damp . the room was very dark ; only the last grey light of the rainy evening came through a slit of a window .
at these words the dog of maol mor disappeared into the forest . and [male] went to seek his cows , which were standing in the hollow where the darkness had come upon them . at the sight of [male] the brown haired they walked onwards . [male] following ever behind them , and looking neither to the right nor to the left . all that day they walked , and when night fell they were in a barren plain .
in the morning they found that the girl 's hand had been withered . the woman 's second daughter was the corpse watcher the second night and her right hand had been left [female] . this was the third and last night that the hunter king would be waked , and to night there was no one to watch his corpse . the woman and her daughters lighted candles and placed them in the window recesses and at the head of the corpse . then they went into their dormer room and left [female] to her watching .
ailie stepped up on a seat , and laid herself on the table as her friend the surgeon told her . arranged herself , gave a rapid look at [female] . shut her eyes , rested herself on me . and took my hand , the operation was at once begun ; it was necessarily slow . and chloroform -- one of god 's best gifts to his suffering children .
when they arrived on the scene [female] was badly torn . and bleeding , but he was still fighting , the boy could not battle with the eagle . all that he could do was to seek more efficient help , hurry , [male] . and call [male] and the wild geese , he cried , the instant he said that . the eagle flew back and stopped fighting , who 's speaking of [male] ? ', he asked .
until i perceived the device i had concluded it to be impossible for me to get from this abyss . which i regarded as my grave ; but now i changed my opinion , and began to think upon the means of my deliverance . i began to collect together the largest diamonds i could find . and put them into the leather bag in which i used to carry my provisions . i afterwards took the largest of the pieces of meat .
the ear li er hours of the night passed by ; and then there was a cry of alarm on deck . a moment after ward there was a great crash , the ship had struck upon a rock . the water rushed in , she was sinking , ah , where now were those who had lately been so heart free and glad ? every heart was full of fear , no one knew what to do , a small boat was quickly launched . and the prince with a few of his bravest friends leaped into it .
he therefore taught them astronomy , mathematics , the alphabet . how to cure diseases , and the art of divination . he created this race in such great numbers that the gods began to see the necessity of instituting certain fixed laws with regard to the sacrifices due to them . and the worship to which they considered themselves entitled from mankind in return for the [male] which they accorded them . an assembly was therefore convened at mecone in order to settle these points .
it was a fine easy night with just a touch of soft fog on . and a little air coming down from the mountain as we got to dreem y cuschaage . there the leader sounded his big [male] 's horn . and as they went galloping down to the dhoon , out came some more of the lil fellas from the gill and joined them . and more talking and laughing went on , he blew another blast at ballellin .
hebe retraced her steps to the wilderness . her heart filled with a hope which already began to dissipate her melancholy . the warnings of the fairy caused her some anxiety . but her prudent reflections were soon banished by others , as dangerous as they were agreeable . on reaching home she found a courier awaiting her with a message from the king .
as usual , i accepted her explanations in silence . but , when i see the poodle opposite , in his varying glories of blue . and green , and orange , and purple , i can not help thinking that perhaps my fair [male] did not always speak the truth . ours is one of the most ancient and noble families in the land , and i contend that family pride is an exalted sentiment . i still hold to this belief , in spite of all the sufferings that it has brought upon me .
the stream of life is the stream of joy . and forgetfulness is [male] , he looked at the young girl . it was [male] and then again not [male] . still less , an enchanted phantom , as he had named her . when he met her near grindelwald .
but the gods of the norsemen were never wholly gods . always they , like the gods of [female] . endeared themselves to humanity by possessing some little , or big , human weakness , and [female] is none the less lovable to the descendants of her worshippers because she possessed the so called `` feminine weakness '' of love of dress , jewels , too . she loved , and knowing the wondrous skill of the dwarfs in fashioning exquisite ornaments .
his grinning companion left him , and he wandered about the great edifice . where he saw a large number of little imps busily at work . some were painting the wall with small brushes , it was amazing to see how rapidly they could sketch a picture . just then he heard behind the curtain the sound as of a mighty rushing wind . and at the same moment the two fountains boiled up and cast out their dirt .
however , as they had everything in the world to talk about . they would probably have been most annoyed if they had found their way instead of losing it . so they just went on losing it as happily as possible , until they could not walk another step because an immense giant was occupying the whole of the roadway . there he sat , smoking a great pipe that looked like a chimney pot that wanted sweeping . and when the princess saw him , she was so frightened that she hid herself behind [female] and peeped under his arm to see what was going to happen .
[male] had shown him deep hidden mountain dales and had let him peep into caves where mother wolves brought up their young . he had also made the acquaintance of the tame reindeer that grazed in herds along the shores of the beautiful torne lake . and he had been down to the great falls and brought greetings to the bears that lived thereabouts from their friends and relatives in westmanland . ever since he had seen [female] , the goose girl . he longed for the day when he might go home with [male] and be a normal human being once more .
old north wind bustled away with angry shrieks , but she knew full well the power of south wind and mr. [male] . but , like many people , she wanted to believe in her own strength and power . and so she roared louder and louder as she blew back to her cold homeland in order to convince herself of her might . mr. [female] decided that the only way to get all the wood animals to have a good opinion of him was to give a big dinner . for he had somehow got rather a bad name among the animals for being so tricky .
he disappeared with the magician , and as the magician never was seen again he probably never escaped from the ends of the earth . as for the palace it and all that was in it were returned to the place where it first stood . and the sultan was so delighted to see his daughter again that he gladly forgave [male] . the tailor 's son was raised to the greatest honors in the kingdom . and upon the sultan 's death he became sultan .
then he bowed before the [male] fairy and . kissing [male] 's red lips , went back into his valley . at once he became interested , gathering more of the clay from the bank he carried it to his house . then , with the aid of his knife and a bit of wood he succeeded in working the clay into the image of a toy nymph . with skillful strokes he formed long , waving hair on the head and covered the body with a gown of oakleaves .
so sir [male] rode quickly forth . and [male] his brother rode with him . instead of a squire , to do him service , as they followed the [male] by the cry of the hounds . they came to a great river , the [male] swam over . and they followed after , and so at length they chased him into a castle .
the prince followed her secretly to see what she was going to do . he crouched down in the doorway and heard the wicked witch telling the horses to wait next morning till [male] was asleep . and then to go and hide themselves in the river , and to stay there till she told them to return . and if they did not do as she told them the old woman threatened to beat them till they bled . when [male] heard all this he went back to his room .
but when the rag doll married , it was the broom handle she picked because the broom handle fixed her eyes . a proud child , proud but careless , banged the head of the rag doll against a door one day and knocked off both the glass eyes sewed on long ago . it was then the broom handle found two black [location] prunes . and fastened the two [location] prunes just where the eyes belonged . so then the rag doll had two fine black eyes brand new .
the poor children had now nowhere to play , they tried to play on the road . but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones , and they did not like it . they used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over . and talk about the beautiful garden inside , `` how happy we were there , '' they said to each other . then the spring came , and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds .
but the young man told her all his sad tale . and how he possessed a wonderful snuffbox , and how it had been stolen from him . and how he had nothing left now that he was parted from his wife and was in need of everything . and he said that perhaps her son , who traveled so far , might have seen a palace with laths of gold and tiles of diamond and furnished all in silver and gold . as he spoke these last words the moon came in and said he smelled mortal flesh and blood .
`` where is it then ? '' asked the old woman , rather crossly , for she did not like being made fun of . the following morning , when the dragon had left the mill . the prince came back , and the old woman told him all that the creature had said . he listened in silence , and then returned to the castle . where he put on a suit of shepherd 's clothes .
a low knocking at the door was heard in the midst of this stillness . startling all the inmates of the cottage ; for there are times when a little circumstance . happening quite unexpectedly , can unduly alarm us , but there was here the additional cause of alarm that the enchanted forest lay so near . and that the little promontory seemed just now inaccessible to human beings , they looked at each other doubtingly . as the knocking was repeated accompanied by a deep groan , and the knight sprang to reach his sword .
there are certain things which from immemorial custom are regarded as being wrong , and appropriate punishments for which are generally recognised . especially stealing , wounding , killing and adultery ; but the punishment for these is administered by the injured parties and their friends . favoured and supported by public opinion , and often , where the offender belongs to another clan . actively helped by the whole clan of the injured parties , the penalty for stealing is the return or replacement of the article stolen . but stealing within the community , and perhaps even more so within the clan or village .
as soon as she was departed he went to her daughters . thanked them for their information , and told them to prepare to leave the place . whilst they were packing up their things he went to the rope . and having pulled at it his companions instantly let down the [male] . in which he placed the eldest sister , and by her sent word to them to draw them all up .
in his urgent need the ape thrust the [male] , which he had turned into a needle . into his ear , turned into a sparrow , and flew up into the crest of a tree . [male] who was following in his tracks , suddenly lost sight of him . but his keen eyes soon recognized that he had turned himself into a sparrow . so he flung away spear and crossbow , turned himself into a sparrow hawk .
but the power that protects all creatures had put a squint into this man 's eye . so that he always threw crooked , this gentleman 's name was [male] fionnliath . and his stronghold was near the harbour of galway . whenever a dog barked he would leap out of his seat . and he would throw everything that he owned out of the window in the direction of the bark .
and why do i call this the story of the white bird ? listen : any [female] or [female] or [female] might have found the sword of brightness or the fruit of happiness . but you may depend upon it that nobody but a real prince could ever have found the white bird . once upon a time there was a rich brother and a poor brother . and the one lived across the street from the other , the rich brother had all of the world 's gear that was good for him and more besides . as for the poor brother , why , he had hardly enough to keep soul and body together .
within the hills folk did won . women and men , dwarfs many a one . the more usual appellation of the dwarfs is [person] or trold . a word originally significant of any evil spirit , giant monster . magician , or evil person ; but now in a good measure divested of its ill senses .
once upon a time there was a man who lived in a small house with a large garden . he made his living by gardening , while his wife looked after the house . they were better off than most of their neighbours , but they were an envious couple who looked sourly over the hedge at all who passed by . and took no man 's advice about anything . at the end of the garden stood a large pear tree : and one day the man was working in the shade beneath it .
`` do not utter that name , which only recalls my grief , '' said the prince , sadly . but [male] , determined to gratify his curiosity , made all sorts of inquiries . and discovered that [male] was lodged in the next room , he did so . and beheld a wonderful sight , there sat the fairest princess in all the world . attired in a robe of silver brocade .
at this , [male] would stay down no longer , he came out of the well . with the mill stone round his neck . ad went straight to the squire and complained that the other men were trying to make a fool of him . he would not be their priest , he said . he had too little learning for that , saying this , he bent down his head and shook the stone off .
`` sir , i thank you , '' said sir gringamor , and taking sir [male] by the hand he led him into the bower where sat the lady lyones . who sprang to meet sir [female] , to her sir gringamor told all that he had heard . and then left sir [female] to tell her more of himself , in the days when king [male] had established his kingdom . he was called emperor of [location] and its three islands .
the golden archer was so agitated that he turned his eyes upon her . and all at once she knew that he was alive and her heart was aflame with love for him . next day she came alone to the tower . she found him pointing north and looking away from her . for the vow had gripped him again like the frosts of winter .
leaving the forest of gold , they reached a wood where all the trees were of silver . their arrival was greeted by an immense number of animals of various kinds . these crowded together and pushed one against another to get close to their friend , he spoke to each one and stroked and petted them . meanwhile the girl broke off a branch of silver from one of the trees . saying to herself , these will serve me as tokens of this wonderful land .
hans and his mother arrived at the city of white towers on the evening before the day on which [male] was to try his fortune . they heard on all sides that the `` one armed count , '' as he was called , was to be the next competitor ; but , of course . they had no idea that this one armed count ', was [male] . the consequence was that , when they found themselves next day in the great square .
the vizier , too , gave him a ring . together with a heavy purse , mad with joy . said hurried home , but here [male] was awaiting him . anxious lest he should have lost his handsome servant . the little man raved at said , but the latter had seen that his purse was full of money .
as he left the precincts of the ruined priory . he continued his vows of vengeance against [male] and all associated with him . he had , he declared aloud . been assaulted and murdered , besides being robbed of fifty pounds as well , he would . on the very next day , put the law in motion `` against all the peoples ''
on the other hand , he was extremely angry when he was not treated with respect and as a [male] . a nobleman of the family of [male] once came to hudemühlen . this nobleman was highly respected for his learning ; he was a canon of the cathedral of verden . and had been ambassador to the elector of brandenburg and the king of denmark . when he heard of the house spirit , and that he expected to be treated as a [male] .
next day the prince seized a favourable opportunity for making his request . and the king gladly granted it on condition that only one night should be spent out for fear of too great fatigue after such a long illness . next morning prince [male] and [male] were off betimes . attended by two grooms leading the two extra horses , they hunted a little by the way . but took care to get as far from the towns as possible , at night fall they reached an inn .
he was ecstatic rather than curious , not quite so good as they used to be . but very good , '' said [male] , `` i like these sugar ones immensely . the ones with the pink sugar are the pick . but the ginger beer was not of the time honored brand , it was drinkable enough . but it had a cork tied , instead of a long cool mouth with a glass stopper .
what was it that wrought this peaceful wonder of the sixteenth century ? was it a fairy spell magic ointment . star tipped wand , treasures of caves . or ocean depths ? was it anything that dragons . giants , ogres , or even swords .
on the earth below there were other beings -- the dainty elves . who danced and fluttered about , attending to the trees and flowers and grasses . the vanir were permitted to rule over the elves , then below the earth . in caves and hollows , there was another race . the dwarfs or gnomes , little , twisted creatures .
his friends called him , but he did not come . and they grew tired and went to their own homes , the light of day began to fail .

no more time elapsed than would have been wanted to move once round a cottage before they were back again . and long delivered the acorn to the prince , `` sir , let it fall on the ground . '' the prince let it fall and that moment the princess stood beside him . and when the sun began to show itself beyond the mountains . the folding doors flew open with a crash .
nod watched him stride away , with a [male] , skip , and a jump he crashed across the frozen water . and soon disappeared down the steep path that led into the forest , when he was out of sight . nod lay down in the shadow of the log hut , he felt a strange comfort . as if there was nothing in all [male] to be afraid of , his rage and sullenness were gone . he would rest here awhile with this [male] , if he were as kind as he seemed to be .
as now they continued to climb higher and higher up the mountain , and saw from many a giddy height the rocks and crags below them looking like a vast expanse of sea suddenly turned into ice whilst tossed by a violent tempest . the noble [male] drew his breath more freely , he poured forth war songs and love longs in the clear mountain air . and the startled echoes repeated from rock to rock the lays of his frankish home . he sprang lightly from one precipice to another , using strongly and safely his staff for support . and turning now to the right , now to the left , as the fancy seized him .
that was three hundred years ago , and still the solid rock vaulted the old warrior 's slumber . and over his head men talked of him . and told how he was reserving the strength of his old age till his country should again call for him . the call seemed to come now ; for his descendant , little duke [male] the ninth . was but a child ; and being in no fear of him .
fierce , yet wonderfully kind , it had a surprising effect upon the children . seeming to soothe them and drive away all fear , one of little [male] 's hands dropped upon the head of a leopard crouching near . whilst [male] gazed straight into the [male] 's eyes and smiled as at an old friend . the [male] smiled in return , and advancing to [male] . laid himself down at his feet , the tip of his nose resting on the boy 's little red shoes .
we entered [location] , and had come within a short distance of [female] ( where i hoped . considering the fair wind , we might have arrived the day following ) . when in the night , while i was asleep , my sisters watched their opportunity . and threw me overboard , they did the same to the prince . who was drowned , i floated some minutes on the water .
the arrangement of sofa and table are excellent . but there should be other centers of interest in the room . as it is , this room just misses its aim . and is neither a strict period room nor a really comfortable modern one . the height and size of a room must be taken into account in hanging curtains .
another minute and all was gone , [male] his eyes and wondered if he had not been asleep . but who ever heard of a man falling asleep standing up with no better prop than a stick in his hand ? he looked at the gates , they were closed and fast . he looked down the road , but could distinguish nothing . in the distance , however , he could hear the sound of .
the palace grew quieter day by day . the ladies in waiting were forbidden to wear high heels because they made such a clatter on the marble floors . so everybody knew for the first time how short everybody else was . every courtier whose boots creaked was instantly banished , and if he had a [male] into the bargain he was beheaded as well . but the climate was so delightful that this very rarely happened , in time , everybody at court took to speaking in a whisper .
the prince begged for a foal of the mare . which the mother dragon at once gave him . and over and above , a cloak made of gold , for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty . so in the evening he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak . but before the entertainment was over he slipped away , and went straight to the stables .
' what is the news where you come from , my grandson , ', asked she . all this time the gazelle had been standing close to the door . holding the sword in one of its front paws , and as the snake put one of his heads through the hole that he had made so as to get in and out comfortably . it cut it of so clean that the snake really did not feel it . the second blow was not quite so straight , for the snake said to himself .
`` all these gifts shall be hers , '' added the old man . and with these words they vanished , the [female] was filled with awe . and fell on her knees in prayer , then her heart was filled with joy and peace . and she went back into the house , she had scarcely crossed the threshold when her stepmother came forward . and looking at her sternly , said , `` well , where have you been ? ''
of course , all this helps you to know how the corn fairies look in the evening . the night time and the moonlight . now we shall see how they look in the day time . in the day time the corn fairies have their overalls of corn gold cloth on . and they walk among the corn rows and climb the corn stalks and fix things in the leaves and stalks and ears of the corn .
at these words prince [male] felt himself a fire . he believed , without weighing it , that he could accomplish this fine adventure . and , spurred on by love and ambition , he resolved to explore then and there and discover the truth for himself . they grew until nothing but the tops of the castle towers could be seen . leaping down from his horse he started to run towards the wood .
so she left the golden pot shining all alone under the pine tree , and ran home as fast as she could . when she reached the house it was almost twilight . but her father was still in the garden , every rose and [male] had to be tied up after the shower . and he was but just finishing , he had the tin milk pan hung on him like a shield . because it rhymed with man , it certainly was a beautiful rhyme .

the words were hardly out of his mouth when a young doe ran right across the field they were standing in . quick as thought let her run on a short distance , in order to give her a start . and then pursued her so quickly and so lightly that you could not have tracked his footsteps if the field had been strewn with flour . in a very few springs he had overtaken the doe . and had so impressed [male] with his fleetness of foot that he begged quick as thought to go with him .
suddenly , in the midst of his despair , he remembered the three feathers that he had plucked from the crow 's wing . he feared they were lost , but after some search he found them laid away in a corner with the rags he had once worn . he took them up , and blowing one of them into the air he called upon the crow to come and help him . almost at once he heard outside a heavy flapping of wings . and a large crow flew in through the window and lighted beside him .
madame [organization] never seems to make a mistake . she handles the attentions of the duke impeccably . and she manages her relationship with lady [female] with wit and consummate skill . maybe our greatest reservation about her judgment has to do with her steadfast preference for [female] . but one can hardly doubt the happiness of the favored couple , there is little reason to doubt that [male] can handle prosperity .

the point to which they were to run was a peeled tree toward the rising sun . and then back to the starting place , which was a war club of iron . whoever won this stake , was empowered to use it in dispatching the defeated champion . if white feather should overcome the first giant , he was to try the second . and so on , until they had all measured speed with him .

at the moment the head touched the ivory neck . the queen , uttering the magic word . dropped the end of the wand , and immediately the head adhered as firmly as of old . but a wild shout of horror rang through all the plain ! for , at the critical moment , the dwarf had reached out his hand .
by this time thoroughly awakened , [male] stumbled upon his feet . and stood making abject bows before the angry little fairy chamberlains . he let his eyes be bound with a green silk ribbon . and leading strings were passed around his waist , at the blast of a golden trumpet . the procession moved forward with a sound of tripping feet and whirring [location] wings and tinkling bells most lovely to the ear .

the east wind took the prince on his arm and carried him over . and the flowers and leaves sang the sweetest songs of his childhood . but in so lovely a strain of melody as no human voice ever yet sang . were they palm trees or gigantic water plants that grew on this favored spot ? the prince could not tell , for never had he seen such large and luxuriant trees before .

and the little harpers struck the chords , and as [male] listened to the music it seemed to him as if he was being slowly lifted from his seat . and when the music ended the fairies vanished , the shining star went out . and [male] was in perfect darkness , the air blew keenly in his face . and he knew not where he was , at last he saw a faint gray light . and soon this light grew broader and brighter , and as the shadows fled before it .

encouraged by these words , the hunters decided to remain with the king . one of them began to batter at the door , but the king was anxious to preserve the inscription . and after more cutting away of weeds , the key was seen to be sticking in the keyhole . unlocking the door , however , was no light task , for ages of rust had accumulated . when finally this was accomplished the door creaked heavily on its hinges and a musty smell came from the dank corridor that was revealed .

schahriar was so much charmed with the story , and became so much in love with [male] . that he resolved to let her live a month . he got up , however , as usual , without acquainting her with his resolution .

the wicked neighbor , as before , heard of the good old man 's fortune . and of all that had so auspiciously befallen him , and he could not suppress all the envy and jealousy that filled his heart . he called to mind how he had failed in his attempt to find the gold coins . and then in making the magic cakes ; this time surely he must succeed if he imitated the old man . who made withered trees to flower simply by sprinkling ashes on them .
so sir [male] and his seven fellows went back on foot beside the corpse of queen [female] from almesbury unto glastonbury . and they buried her with solemn devotion in the chapel at the hermitage . when she was put in the earth sir [male] swooned . for he remembered the noblesse and kindness that was both with the king and with herself . and how by his fault and his pride they were both laid full low .
it was certainly very diverting to see [male] in this dress . and mounted on the mouse , as he rode out a hunting with the king and nobility . who were all ready to expire with laughter at [male] and his fine prancing charger . one day , as they were riding by a farmhouse . a large cat , which was lurking about the door , made a spring .

i expect we will find the [person] inside the gate , ', said [person] . and they made their way on in silence . it was a good while since they had been in the ladywood garden . and when they had got on to their feet again , they stood still for a minute or two looking round them . it was a curious looking place certainly ; the very beauty of it had something strange and dream like about it .
the next morning the soldiers set out home . and soon after they reached their castle , happening to want some money . they went to their purse for it . and found something indeed in it ; but to their great sorrow . when they had emptied it , none came in the place of what they took .

the châtelet , in its judicial functions , was inferior to the parliament . nevertheless it acquired , through its provost , who represented the bourgeois of [location] . considerable importance in the eyes of the supreme court . in fact , for two centuries the provost held the privilege of ruling the capital . both politically and financially , of commanding the citizen militia , and of being chief magistrate of the city .

it was a platform of rock raised a few feet from the floor and covered with sheep skins . upon which lay two horrible figures asleep , at once recognized by [male] as the king and queen of the goblins . he lowered his torch instantly lest the light should awake them . as he did so , it flashed upon his pickaxe . lying by the side of the queen , whose hand lay close by the handle of it .
gathering her grey robes closer about her , creeping shadow entered boldly . and sped through the hall , groups of gaily chattering fire fairies saw this strange visitant flit by them . but were too startled and amazed to check her as she passed , so she came unhindered into the presence of the royal company . then the prince saw her also and knew her to be a servant of the shadow witch . yet before he could answer , creeping shadow had reached them and had thrown herself at king red flame 's feet .

`` they instantly changed into [male] birds .

there was once upon a time an old poet , such a really good old poet ! one evening , he sat at home . it was dreadful weather out of doors . the rain poured down ; but the old poet sat so comfortably , and in such a good humor . beside his stove , where the fire was burning brightly , and his apples were merrily roasting .
he attacked the man now and then , `` come , go thither , '' said my father . i tied a lariat on a large red mare that was very tall , and taking a very light gun which my father had . i went over there , when i arrived the buffalo bull was standing motionless . the man said he was very glad that i had come . the buffalo bull was savage , the man shot suddenly at him with a bow and wounded him on the back .

before each bunch is placed on the pile the fruitheads are spread out like an open fan . these piles are never completed until they are higher than the woman 's arm can reach . several of the last bunches being tossed in place , guided only by the tips of the fingers touching the butt of the straw . the women with their heads loaded high with ripened grain are striking figures . and one wonders at the security of the loads .

notwithstanding the genius displayed in his other works , the `` fairytales '' will always be regarded as the most precious legacy which the great author has bequeathed to posterity . and of these `` the cold heart '' holds undoubtedly the first place in popular esteem . unlike the majority of his fairy-tales , it owes something of its origin to folk lore . as it is based on an old black forest legend , but the human figures in the story are [male] 's very own . those conversant with the master 's works will recognise in [male] and fat [male] characters which only [male] could have created .

and the speaker took out of his pocket a little book full of white leaves of paper . and with a pencil he made a sketch of the smoking ruins . the blackened rafters , and the chimney that overhung them and which seemed more and more to totter . and quite in the foreground stood the large , blooming rosebush , which added beauty to the picture . indeed , it was for the sake of the roses that the sketch had been made .

sara followed [female] along the path of silver gravel that led around the house . and then up a little outside staircase of marble to the balcony . and there , on the third step from the top , she paused . has any mortal but [female] ever seen [female] ? certainly there never was another fairy so [female] and wild and beautiful . when [female] caught sight of her she was leaning over the marble balustrade .
when they set out to look for shelter , they found every inn full of the servants expelled before them . and not one would yield his place to a superior suddenly levelled with himself , most houses refused to admit them on the ground of the wickedness that must have drawn on them such a punishment . and not a few would have been left in the streets all night , had not [female] . roused by the vain entreaties at the doors on each side of her cottage . opened hers , and given up everything to them .
pazza raised her hand , and , lo , the king 's son received a box on the ear .

ecstatic as [male] was , he could see sense in this . but vacation came first and [female] was a [female] at [location] that summer . her beauty blossomed , and all the repressed vivacity of her nature came to the surface . her room at rockcrest commanded the ocean . and every night before she slept she knelt before her window and gave thanks for a happiness which seemed as illimitable as the waters rolling to the horizon .
by good luck they reached the opening . near which the vine was growing , and , just as the furious fairy got near enough to stretch out her long arm after them . down went [female] , goat , and coffee mill . through a rift in the clouds , to a land where their enemy could not follow them . the faithful vine caught them as they fell .
at these words , the hippodrac beat an excited tattoo on the table . and before the soldier could seize it , spread its little gleaming wings . and fled through the barred window out into the world , now the chancellor . knowing that his wicked scheme had succeeded , and never dreaming of the possibility of the grenadier 's escape . had gone a hunting : so the princess took matters into her own hands .
it was a dull life , but he had never known any other . anyhow , he remembered no other , and he did not pity himself at all . not for a long time , till he grew quite a big little boy . and could read quite easily , then he suddenly took to books , which the deaf mute brought him from time to time . books which , not being acquainted with the literature of nomansland .
the fifth [male] , that appeared to reach the nest , was supported by the sides of the rock . yet it swung to and fro , and flapped about like a slender reed . and as if it had been bound by fishing lines , it seemed a most dangerous undertaking to ascend it . but [male] knew how to climb ; he had learnt that from the cat . and he had no fear , he did not observe [male] .

herself let a scream could be heard in the next townland . but she never asked to stir from where she was standing , the appearance of the eel twisted itself out of the sack and travelled along the ground . putting the six feet of its length into the awfullest loops and knots were ever seen . then it reared up its head and neck to stand swaying for a while . a full half of it in the air .

then [male] mongla 's mother went to him and asked him whether there was any truth in this counter charge . he saw at once what had happened and explained that he had never called out his sister in law by name . he had called out for the plough ; `` pal ho , pal ho ! '' because his brothers had not got the ploughs ready ; when [female] understood what a mistake she had made . she was covered with confusion and they brought water and she washed [female] mongla 's feet as she had done on the day of her marriage .
the winter after [male] 's wedding . he and [male] were bidden to a great feast at [male] 's house . [male] and his wife greeted them heartily . and by and by [male] , [male] 's son . came , and with him [male] his wife .
they got out of the car and walked across at the corner . then [female] saw the bridge , it was a simple span going over a wide stream bed . but there was not very much water in the stream bed below , and the bridge was built of concrete . just like the culvert he would hidden in on his first day . part of the town was on one side of the bridge .
the king would have been extremely surprised to hear this , for , of course . he never hunted anything so small as a rabbit . but rabbits are foolish enough for anything , as all the world knows . and it is certain that the rabbits of the king 's forest would never have had a happy moment to this day . if the green enchantress had not suddenly taken it into her head to try and bewitch the king .
the regular features , now slightly flushed with the fever , of the patient in her charge . on the contrary , were constantly varying in expression , she had noticed the entrance of the visitors . and when she opened her sparkling blue eyes and saw the person to whom her poor heart clung with insatiable yearning they were filled with a sunny [female] . and a smile hovered round her lips , she had known that he would come . that he would not let her die without granting her one more glance .

yes , the ropedancer was jealous of the laurel crowned child , she , who cared so little for law and duty . virtue and morality , now felt offended , wounded , tortured by [female] 's conduct . but there was no time to ponder over the reason now , she had already delayed too long ere moving forward . yet even calm reflection would not have revealed the right answer to the problem . how could she have suspected that what stirred her passionate soul so fiercely was grief at the sight of the man whom she had regarded as the stronghold of integrity .
however , the gallop in the hot sun on the other side soon dried them . in an hour and a half they were on the top of a hill from which they could see the town of arecarp in the valley beneath . the sun was shining brightly on the tents of the army as it lay round the town . and at some distance the camp of the enemy appeared . but still all looked peaceful , down the hill the road lay through a deep gorge .
the youth went to the tree , and lay down and slept , and about midnight he arose to look at the tree . and the dates were all there -- beautiful dates , swinging in bunches . and he sat and read till the cocks crew and it grew light . and the dates were still on the tree , then he got up and took a road that led straight past the palace . but he had not walked many steps before he met a man carrying a large silver dish .
he was indulgent to all , because he never forgave himself . and ever veiled severity in gentleness , his wisdom partook neither of arrogance nor passion . it descended to the level of your comprehension . and while pointing upwards , led you by the hand . and guided the ascent , it was a mother who instructed .
shortly after leaving the old man they came to a wide stretch of land . solitary and barren as a desert , over which they journeyed until hunger . thirst , and fatigue compelled them to rest , exhausted , they sank on the sandy ground and wept bitterly . suddenly , at a short distance from them arose a large stone . on whose surface stood a dish of smoking roast beef .
gifts we gave him . what were they ? happiness the livelong day ; happiness and heart 's delight was the gift of every sprite . better far than sacks of wealth were our gifts of youth and health . health to keep him young and gay was the gift of every [male] . gifts we gave him from our store .
he came to the village late at night . it was so dark he could see nothing and it was raining pitchforks . [male] went straight to the fairy 's house . firmly resolved to knock at the door , when he found himself there . he lost courage and ran back a few steps .
when he had got better again his wife one day wanted fish . and asked him to go and buy some , the man , however , wished again to show what he had learned . so he asked her to come along with him and bring her dough trough and a ladle . they both seated themselves in this , and rowed upon the lake . when they had got out a little way the man said .
almost in the dark my new acquaintance led me across this wide hall into the room destined for my reception . it was spacious , and wainscoted up to the ceiling , the furniture of this capacious chamber was old-fashioned and clumsy . there were curtains still to the windows , and a piece of [location] carpet lay upon the floor . those windows were two in number , looking out , through the trunks of the trees close to the house . upon the lake , it needed all the fire .
and now the glovemaking went on but slowly , the orders given by the shops in the town were not finished quickly . for the metal pig had taught the boy that all objects may be drawn upon paper . and [male] is a picture book in itself for any one who chooses to turn over its pages . on the piazza della trinita stands a slender pillar . and upon it is the goddess of justice blindfolded .
he leaped from his horse , and ran towards her . she held out her hand for him to kiss . but he could not get at it for the glass . transported with eagerness and delight , he dashed his sword through the crystal . and succeeded in breaking a small opening , to which she put up her beautiful rosy mouth .
she then gave her the same directions she had formerly given [female] . with this difference , that she told her to go into the picture hall when she pleased . showing her the entrance , against which the clock no longer stood -- and went away . closing the door behind her , as soon as she was left alone . [female] set to work tidying and dusting the cottage .
she could not help setting the door a little ajar . just to peep in , when -- pop , out flew the moon , when her foster mother came home and found the moon let out . she was very downcast , and said to the [female] she must go away . she could not stay with her any longer , but the [female] wept so bitterly . and prayed so heartily for forgiveness , that this time , too , she got leave to stay .
as a child she must have had a real [female] 's angel head . but now it was an old angel 's head with silvery white hair , well curled . the daughters were tall , slender , refined and much dressed , the young cousin who was with them . was clad in white from head to foot ; he had golden hair and immense [male] . he immediately showed little [male] the greatest attention .
the godmother did not wish to remind him of his misfortunes . so she told him that she would take good care of him and that he would find it very pleasant in her hut . but she was worried how she should find a suitable place for him to sleep . and how she should clothe him and provide the things necessary for his comfort . she placed him on the top of the linen press and opened the altar for him .
in his best designs [male] was much influenced by [male] and [male] and the style of [male] . but like them he also developed his own special and beautiful style . he used mahogany and a great deal of satin wood of beautiful grain and of a delightful straw color . which was often veneered on oak frames , he was exceedingly fond of inlay . and his designs called for inlaid panels .
there were two strong cords in the room , [female] made a large noose with a slip knot at the ends of both these . and , as the giants were coming through the gates , he threw the ropes over their heads . he then made the other ends fast to a beam in the ceiling . and pulled with all his might , till he had almost strangled them , when he saw that they were both black in the face . and had not the least strength left , he drew his sword and slid down the ropes .
better let him sleep peacefully now , she looked at him . smiled in spite of herself , and went quickly down into the palace . [female] awoke , slightly refreshed , and decided to take a firm line with the countess at once . he had no difficulty about finding his way down to her . the palace seemed to be full of servants , all apparently busy about something which brought them for a moment in sight of the newly arrived prince .
the clock talked politics— `` tick , tick '' . he professed to know what was the time of day . but there was a whisper that he did not go correctly , the [male] cane stood by . looking stiff and proud—he was vain of his brass ferrule and silver top . and on the sofa lay two worked cushions , pretty but stupid , when the play at the little theater began .
the news of [female] 's victory was soon spread over the western parts . so that another giant , called old [male] , hearing of it . vowed to be revenged on [male] , if it ever was his fortune to light on him . the giant kept an enchanted castle situated in the midst of a lonesome wood . this dreadful noise so affrighted poor [male] , that he was ready to run distracted .
they played there , sir guy not thinking of treachery . but by and by the princess entered , and sir morgadour after greeting her took his leave quickly and came to the emperor [male] . telling him how sir guy was alone in the chamber with his daughter . [female] , however , paid little heed to the tale . for he said : well , and what of it ? [male] is his promised bride .
he looked sad and weary , and yet he was full of quiet dignity . a surprising figure to meet in a lonely place , his grey clothing hung loosely over his emaciated body . his wide mantle fell in thin folds about him . on his head he wore a broad brimmed , weather beaten hat . at the young man 's exclamation of surprise he raised his head and looked keenly at him .
sir , answered [male] , i beg your majesty not to give me any more disturbance on that head . but rather to oblige me so far as to let me have her in marriage . whatever aversion i may formerly have discovered for women . this young lady has charmed me to that degree . that i can not help betraying my weakness , i am ready to receive her at your majesty 's hands .
after this the fairy led him into a large hall . filled with transparent lilies , the yellow stamina of each flower formed a tiny golden harp . from which came forth strains of music like the mingled tones of flute and lyre . beautiful maidens , slender and graceful in form . and robed in transparent gauze , floated through the dance .
stockings followed the shoes , coat and trousers shared the same fate . but still the man sat over the hole , at last the fox having set the bed and bedding on fire . put a light to the straw on which his jailer lay . and it blazed up to the ceiling , `` no , that i can not stand , '' shouted the man , jumping up ; and the fox , taking advantage of the smoke and confusion .
the king was struck with the vizier 's words and deemed his counsel wise and timely . fearing lest the order of the state be deranged ; so he rose at once and bade carry his son to the pavilion in question . which was built midmost the water and was approached by a causeway , twenty cubits wide . it had windows on all sides . overlooking the sea ; its floor was of variegated marble and its roof was painted in the richest colours and decorated with gold and lapis lazuli .
ebn thaher 's friend . who believed all this , told them they were welcome , and offered the prince of persia . whom he knew not , all the assistance he could desire . but [male] thaher spoke for the prince . and said , that his distemper was of a nature that required nothing but rest .
christmas [female] had come , and all the men who worked under [female] or on the farms round about were gathered in the large kitchen to eat the soup flavoured with honey followed by rich puddings . to which they were always invited on this particular night , in the middle of the table was a large wooden bowl . with wooden spoons placed in a circle round it . so that each might dip in his turn , the benches were filled , and [male] was about to give the signal . when the door was suddenly thrown open , and an old man came in , wishing the guests a good appetite for their supper .
and when the young man asked if the girl was carried off straight from her home . they answered no , but that a large cask was set in the forest chapel . and into this she was fastened , [female] is the great dog that belongs to the overseer of our prince , ', said they . `` and he lives not far away. '' and they began to laugh at the question . which seemed to them so odd and useless , the young man did not laugh with them .
at one moment i resolved to confess all to her ; then that i would fly for ever . then i broke out into a flood of bitter tears , and consulted [female] as to the means of meeting her again in the forester 's garden . at times i flattered myself with great hopes from the near approaching visit of the unknown . then wept again , because i saw clearly on reflection that they would end in disappointment . i had made a calculation of the day fixed on by the fearful being for our interview .

king [male] had to run his hardest to catch her . for the little girl in the sunbonnet certainly knew how to put one foot in front of the other . but then , a sunbonnet is not so apt to tumble off a person 's head as a crown . and that makes all the difference in a running race , `` where does the magician live ?

the cudgeling ceased and pharaoh was able to move his arm . he writhed in agony , for he was bruised all over . he rushed hastily away , saying he would return on the morrow . [female] found herself locked in , but she was not again disturbed . pharaoh , however , had further adventures , the spirit was in merry mood and had a night 's entertainment at the king 's expense .
she soon felt the want of them in that cutting wind . but the reindeer did not dare to stop , it ran on till it came to the [female] with the red berries . there it put [female] down , and kissed her on the mouth . while big shining tears trickled down its face , then it ran back again as fast as ever it could . there stood poor little [female] , without shoes or gloves .
after this the beast could not do too much for him , he went out every morning . carefully locking the door behind him -- and returned every evening . bringing in a nice fat baby from an adjacent village . and laying it gratefully at his benefactor 's feet . for the first few days something seemed to have gone wrong with the benefactor 's appetite .
there was a very hot summer , it began to be hot in march . all the rivers were dried up , the grass did not grow , the corn did not grow . the thermometers exploded with heat , the barometers stood at set fair . the people were much distressed , and came and broke the palace windows -- as they usually do when things go wrong in [person] . now , the firedrake is a beast , or bird .
then [male] drew back [male] and looked , and behold , he who had been but a wonderful voice was changed . and she saw that he was a man . and young , and comely , with merry eyes touched with sadness , and a mouth whose curves were both cynical and sweet . `` why , why should you choose me ? '' asked the [male] . in a voice that shook for reverence .
but before we tell you of what [person] did to restore the beauty of [person] 's golden hair . we must tell you of the other beings besides the gods and the goddesses who were in the world at the time . first , there was the vanir , when the gods who were called the asir came to the mountain on which they built [person] . they found other beings there , these were not wicked and ugly like the giants . they were beautiful and friendly ; the vanir they were named .
the marionettes grew bewildered with their new taking ; they did not understand the meaning of all the coarse things they had to do . so in the middle of a play , the little queen would fail now and then in her part . and move awkwardly , wondering what her lover meant when he sprawled to and fro . and seemed trying to find in the air more feet than he had upon the ground . yet the crowd found her bashful fear so irresistibly funny , that it roared again .
she fell upon her knees , but could not speak , when the sixth month was gone . the fruit was large and ripe , and she was very quiet ; the seventh month . she took the [female] berries . ate them eagerly , and was sick and sorrowful ; and the eighth month went by . and she called to her husband , and cried and said , if i die .
the whole scene was a picture of the condition of new england . and its moral , the deformity of any government that does not grow out of the nature of things and the character of the people . on one side the religious multitude , with their sad visages and dark attire . and on the other , the group of despotic rulers , with the high churchman in the midst . and here and there a crucifix at their bosoms , all magnificently clad , flushed with wine .
so [female] went to bed and slept soundly , but his father . who could not get over his disappointment at the waste of his money . was so angry , that he sent for two servants , and gave them orders . which they were to carry out on the following day , next morning one of the servants awakened [male] early . and made him get into a carriage that was waiting for him .
and the bandmaster wrote a work of twenty five volumes about the artificial bird . it was so learned , long , and so full of the hardest chinese words that everyone said they had read it and understood it . for once they had been very stupid about a book , and had been trampled under foot in consequence . so a whole year passed , the emperor , the court . and all the chinese knew every note of the artificial bird 's song by heart .
when [female] was about eighteen , his adopted father told him that he would now give him an opportunity of showing his prowess on the battle field . as he had resolved to gather all his clan and retainers . and make a grand raid into a neighbouring territory , of which the people were at the time in a state of anarchy and confusion . which circumstance he had no doubt would greatly aid him in his intended project of subjugation . this was welcome news to the fiery youth .
that was an enormous sum , nearly the whole that he possessed . but [male] , remembering his vow , paid the money and took the casket home . it was placed upon the table that night when the passover festival began . on being opened it was found to contain a smaller casket , this was opened and out sprang a frog . [female] 's wife was sorely disappointed , but she gave food to the frog which devoured everything greedily .
all eyes were attentively fixed on mrs. [female] as she concluded . and the children agreed that this was the best story they had yet heard . when they had done commenting on it , [male] observed that it was getting dusk . and was time for him and his brother to be going . when he had taken his leave , the children sat talking with their mother till near dark .
episodes 1 6 of the pallisers are based on the first novel in the series . can you forgive her ? first , the reader and the viewer must understand that the woman we are asked to forgive is not lady [female] . the true heroine , but [female] vavasor . a distant cousin of [female] 's , [female] 's story is indeed the main plot of the book . but [male] apparently realized that [male] 's story would be more appealing to the television audience .
one of the royal invitations was brought to the palace by the sea . and the servants carried it up to the old lord who still sat by his window . wrapped in his long white hair and weeping into the little river that was fed by his tears . but when he heard the king 's command he dried his eyes and bade them bring shears to cut him loose . for his hair had bound him a fast prisoner and he could not move .
`` stones it shall be , '' said the man . [male] then went into the forest and began to cut and chop away at the trees and work away as hard as he could . but in spite of all his cutting and chopping he could only turn out troughs . toward dinner time he wanted something to eat and opened his bag . but there was not a crumb of food in it .
however , while he continued to fret , there entered the hall a poor child about eight years old . with shaved head , features of livid tint . eyes of light gray , barefooted , barelegged , and a whip knotted over his shoulders in the manner affected by horseboys . speaking and looking like an idiot , he asked the king 's permission to bear the royal ensign in the approaching battle with the giant rion . the courtiers laughed , but [male] , suspecting a new joke on [male] 's part .
`` that 's all very well , '' said her boy , with his eyes on the distance . for awhile she lay enjoying the warmth of the sun . watching the gulls sliding down the unseen slopes of the air . presently high up she saw one hover and pause . settling on nothingness by the swift , almost imperceptible beat of its wings .
i was overjoyed to hear them speak in my own language . and willingly satisfied their curiosity by giving them an account of my shipwreck . and how i fell into the hands of the blacks . those blacks , replied they , eat men . but by what miracle did you escape their cruelty ?
so the next day she went through her process and found that he was bewitched by an old witch . so the following day she set out with six other fairies . and when they came to the gentleman 's house she found he was very ill . whereupon the queen put the little blue pot of perfume on the centre of the table . and lit it , when the room was instantly filled with the most delicious odour .
he laughed when he heard the story of queen [female] 's visit . and told the servants that they had done well ; then he ran upstairs to open the door and release his wife . but what was his horror and dismay , when he did so . to find her lying dead at his feet on the floor . he was nearly beside himself with rage and grief .
large heaps of stones lay about the mosaic floor that still showed signs of a beautiful design . statues had fallen from their pedestals and lay in [female] attitudes . their arms broken , their vacant eyes gazing with stony indifference into the [female] . sometimes their heads were missing , having rolled away as they fell , nature was rapidly doing her work . she was spreading her consoling mantle of verdure and flowers over this crumbling work of art .
[male] awoke early in the morning , and seeing something uncommon darkening the window of his bedchamber . ran downstairs into the garden , where he found some of the beans had taken root . and sprung up surprisingly : the stalks were of an immense thickness , and had twined together until they formed a [male] like a chain . and so high that the top appeared to be lost in the clouds , [male] was an adventurous lad . he determined to climb up to the top , and ran to tell his mother .
when they were debating about this extraordinary case , the miller happened to yawn . when [male] , seizing the chance , made another jump . and alighted safely upon his feet in the middle of the table . the miller , who was very much provoked at being tormented by such a little pygmy creature . fell into a terrible rage , and , laying hold of [male] .
an hour before day , [female] awaked her sister . and says to her , you will certainly be as good as your word , madam , and tell [location] out the story of the fisherman . to assist your memory , i will tell you where you left off . it was where the grecian king maintained the innocence of his physician [male] against his vizier . i remember it , says [male] , and am ready to give you satisfaction .
`` in that case you are perfectly right , '' said the jailor . and , taking off his hat and bowing to him respectfully , he opened the prison doors and let him escape . you can imagine [male] 's joy when he found himself free . without stopping to take breath he immediately left the town and took the road that led to the fairy 's house . whilst he was saying this he stopped suddenly .
they came , and the king when he had laid before them his cause promised them the hands of his three beautiful daughters in return for their support . this was indeed an inducement and every young noble present swore his allegiance and hurried home to gather his forces . troops poured in from all sides and soon the king was ready to set forth . he handed over the affairs of the castle to [male] and also intrusted to him the safety of the three princesses . [male] did his duty faithfully , looking after the castle and planning diversions for the princesses to keep them happy and cheerful .
now , the dove was nearly driven distracted at the jackal 's words . but , in order to save the lives of the other two , she did at last throw the little one out of the nest . the jackal ate it up . and went home to sleep , meanwhile the mother dove sat on the edge of her nest . crying bitterly , when a heron , who was flying slowly past the rock , was filled with pity for her .
now came a painter , he spoke not a word . but his eyes sparkled , he began to whistle , at this the nightingales sang louder than ever . `` hold your tongues , '' he cried testily ; and he made accurate notes of all the colours and transitions . blue , and lilac , and dark brown . `` that will make a beautiful picture , '' he said , he took it in just as a mirror takes in a view .
if either party desires to break the contract the other seldom objects . if they agree to separate , the woman usually remains in their dwelling and the man builds himself another . however , if either person objects , it is the other who relinquishes the dwelling . the man because he can build another and the woman because she seldom seeks separation unless she knows of a home in which she will be welcome . nothing in the nature of alimony .
we stopped at some islands to take in fresh provisions . our vessel being come to a port on the main land in the indies . we touched there , and not being willing to venture by sea to balsora . i landed my proportion of the ivory . resolving to proceed on my journey by land , i made vast sums by my ivory .
we now stand before it in daylight . not a pane of glass is to be found in it . planks and old doors are nailed fast to the window frames . the balls alone still stand on the two towers , broad , heavy , and resembling colossal toadstools . the iron spire of the one still towers aloft in the air .
little boy blue was now very happy , and his mother was proud and contented and began to improve in health . after a few weeks she became strong enough to leave the cottage and walk a little in the fields each day . but she could not go far , because her limbs were too feeble to support her long . so the most she could attempt was to walk as far as the stile to meet little boy blue as he came home from work in the evening . then she would lean on his shoulder and return to the cottage with him .
late in the afternoon the boy fancied he saw a vast heap of stones a long way off . and he flew straight towards it . but when he reached the gates he saw that it was really a great town . so he wished himself back in his own shape and entered the city . he found the palace doors wide open and went boldly into a sort of hall which was full of people .
it was now the third morning since they had left their father 's house . and they still walked on ; but they only got deeper and deeper into the wood . and [person] saw that if help did not come very soon they would die of hunger . about the middle of the day they saw a beautiful [person] bird sitting on a bough . which sang so sweetly that they stood still and listened to it , it soon left off and .
no matter what little daughter was doing , she was happier if her mother was near . and , although she sometimes ran away into her own room and played by herself . she always bounded out at her mother 's first call . and sprang into her mother 's arms . gladder than ever to be with her because she had been away .
he took her hands and his were warm hands . his brown face and his gentian blue eyes were high and noble , and [male] felt a joy like the sharpness of a sword when he sang to her about the brightness of her hair and the blue of her eyes . `` o maid , '' said he , `` is there anything that binds you to this place ? '' [male] showed him the bog down in the basket and the woven thread that was round her neck . `` come with me to my kingdom , '' said he .
when the two were placed side by side , mr. [male] could hardly keep his countenance . but from a mingling of feelings , beside the great , red , round barrel . [male] , all body and no legs . diamond looked like a clothes horse with a skin thrown over it . there was hardly a spot of him where you could not descry some sign of a bone underneath .
they might be described as racy little essays , bristling with point and epigram . on some subject suggested by the title pages of current volumes . at the end of that time , however , books began to grow scarce in our office . and before another month was at an end , we had no more need of a reviewer . my friend was then to have his last trial as a reporter .
as i was thinking of death , i heard the stone lifted up from the mouth of the cave . and immediately the corpse of a man was let down when reduced to necessity . it is natural to come to extreme resolutions , while they let down the woman i approached the place where her coffin was to be put . and as soon as i perceived they were again covering the mouth of the cave . gave the [female] wretch two or three violent blows over the head .
as soon as the king had heard from the judge what a foul action the master of the horse had been guilty of . as appeared by the circumstances of the matter , he upbraided him in these words . is it thus , then , that you [male] and murder my subjects . and then would throw their dead bodies into the sea to hide your villany ? let [location] rid the world of such a monster .
alarmed at his wild aspect the attendants of [female] fled in terror . but the princess , pitying the forlorn condition of the stranger . addressed him with kind and sympathetic words . after hearing from him the account of his shipwreck and the terrible hardships he had undergone . [female] called back her attendants , reproached them for their want of courtesy .
`` come with us , then , '' said the maidens , and they led him down a passage into a hall . out of which opened many chambers , each one of greater splendour than the last . from a shelf heaped up with gold and jewels the eldest sister took a bracelet . which in every way was exactly like the one which was in the judge 's keeping . and fastened it to the youth 's arm .
but , sir , added [male] , how pleasant soever these stories may be . that i have told your majesty hitherto , they do not come near that of the fisherman . [female] , perceiving that the sultaness demurred , says to her , sister , since there is still some time remaining . pray tell [location] the story of the fisherman . if the sultan is willing , [female] agreed to it .
he soon reached his cabin , and surprised his wife sitting over the turf fire in the big chimney . `` but what is that bottle under your waistcoat ? '' said [male] , seeing its neck sticking out . his poor wife was thunderstruck , she sat crying , while [female] told her his story . with many a crossing and blessing between him and harm . she could not help believing him , for she had great faith in fairies .
then the two ladies led the way and showed [female] a little back door in the lowest part of the castle wall . so small that [male] could hardly crawl in , the pheasant , who was all this time fighting hard . saw [male] and his little band rush in at the back . [male] 's onslaught was so furious that the devils could not stand against him . at first their foe had been a single bird , the pheasant .
it was summer , and the ice [female] was melting amidst the green verdure . when [male] swung himself up and down . [male] has many brothers , quite a troop of them . and the ice [male] chose the strongest among them . they exercise their power in different ways , and everywhere .
whity was quite a clever little pig , but she was greedy . she was always thinking of her food and looking forward to her dinner . and when the farm girl was seen carrying the pails across the yard . she would rise up on her hind legs and dance and caper with excitement . as soon as the food was poured into the trough she jostled [female] and [female] out of the way in her eagerness to get the best and biggest bits for herself .
after that , the little boy was never seen any more by any one of his kindred . `` fairy doctors , '' as the dealers in the preternatural , who in such cases were called in . are termed , did all that in them lay -- but in vain , father [male] came down . and tried what holier rites could do , but equally without result , so little [male] was dead to mother . brother , and sisters ; but no grave received him .
evening was falling with the mild beauty of spring on the mountains and pasture lands of the tyrol . the latest sunbeams which streamed down from the lofty glacier bore the tones of the vesper bell through the quiet village street . and floated over the brook and in at the open windows of a substantial farm house which stood at the end of the little valley . a neatly carved balcony surrounded the house , the window panes gleamed like mirrors . and the orderly arrangements of the farm yard showed the owner to be a man of some wealth .
no sooner had they bathed and adorned themselves fittingly than they were summoned to the king 's banquet hall . being escorted thither by twelve young maidens bearing torches with lavender colored flames . yet here , as in the throne room , the ruler of [male] was dressed in simplest garments . and his seat was a rough block of stone . all about him were lords and ladies in gorgeous array .
he had made a bad use of the fairies gift , and they were displeased , so both the monk and [male] felt sorry . yet the grass grew again when the quondam harper and singer ceased desolating the air with his quavers . the air seemed sweeter to breathe , because of the silence . however , the fairies kept on doing good to the people of good will , and today some of the sweetest singers in wales come from the poorest homes .
for a long time the king was not to be comforted , and he did not even think of taking a second wife . at last his councilors said : `` the king must marry again , so that we may have a queen . '' so messengers were sent far and wide to seek for a bride equal to the late queen in beauty . but there was no one in the wide world , and if there had been she could not have had such golden hair . then the messengers came home again , not having been able to find a queen .
her mother and her nurse had told her that this was done so that she might not fall ill . and she had always believed it ; but on that day . for the first time , she began to wonder whether there might be any other reason as well . it was a lovely spring day . and the sun shone through the canvas curtain which was stretched outside rainbow 's open window .
i hope you will delight [location] all with the little instrument . will you not ? thus saying he handed to the [male] the flute which had been cut from the willow tree by the pool . and then announced in a loud voice that the [male] wished to perform a solo on the flute . they wished to tease him -- that was evident , and therefore the [male] declined to play . although he could do so very well , they urged and requested him .
when shadows began creeping over the [location] to lie in [location] . the young man had chopped many logs into equal lengths and proper shapes for building a house such as he had seen the poorer classes of men inhabit . then , resolving to await another day before he tried to fit the logs together . [male] ate some of the sweet roots he well knew how to find . drank deeply from the laughing brook , and lay down to sleep on the grass .
tiny trembled very much ; she was quite frightened , for the bird was large . a great deal larger than herself , -- she was only an inch high . but she took courage , laid the wool more thickly over the poor swallow . and then took a leaf which she had used for her own counterpane . and laid it over the head of the poor bird .
in about an hour they came back with the basket full of meat and vegetables . which they put in a pot , and set on the fire . quite forgetting that the house door stood wide open , the youngest sister . however , took no part in all this , and when dinner was ready and the table laid . she stole softly out to the entrance hall .
we had abstracted the hair , and duly immersed it . why we wished to create a black snake , or what we purposed doing with him when we got him created . i can not now recall , i believe the intention to have been primarily to see whether or not they had told [location] the truth , `` they '' standing for the universe at large , for my part , i was still smarting from having been detected sitting in [male] with a handful of salt . by the mouse hole in the shed , in pursuance of another recipe which i had picked up and trusted .
she was already dressed as a bride , with a [female] garland on her head . in a white dress , with a rainbow coloured girdle , and rich jewels in her hair and on her neck . and she held in her hand the wonderful purse . that was always full of gold , they found the priest and all ready at the church . were married in a few minutes ; and then came home to their wedding feast .
so his mother boiled the rice , when the time fixed for the feast came . nothing was to be seen of the brothers because they did not expect that there would really be anything for them to eat . so the monkey boy went and fetched them . and when they came to the feast they were astonished to have as much rice as they could eat . when the crop was quite ripe the monkey boy gathered all the pumpkins and got sufficient rice from them to last for the whole year .
thus , frightened as she at first was , you might by and by have seen [female] stroking the bull 's forehead with her small white hand . and taking the garlands off her own head to hang them on his neck and ivory horns . then she pulled up some blades of grass . and he ate them out of her hand . not as if he were hungry , but because he wanted to be friends with the child .
almost at once she was lost to his sight among the trees which grew very closely . almost at the same moment , to his horror , something cold and soft touched his face . and lifting his eyes , he saw that the snowflakes were falling thickly . if harm was to betide , it was too late to save her ; but he pressed forward in unspeakable anxiety . it was some little time before he found her .
when she saw the beans , and heard [female] 's account . her [female] quite forsook her , she kicked the beans away in a passion . they flew in all directions -- some were scattered in the garden . not having any thing to eat , they both went supperless to bed . [male] woke early in the morning , and seeing something uncommon from the window of his bedchamber .
there was an innate loftiness , an ethereal quality , about the girl 's personality which carder always felt . in spite of himself , even at the very moments when he was obtruding his familiarities upon her . she was like a fine jewel which he had stolen . but which baffled his efforts to set it among his own possessions . already in the short time which had elapsed since bringing her to the farm , she had fallen away to an alarming delicacy of appearance .
it is my opinion that if we retained in [location] anything of the noble savage . we could not get rid of it too soon , but the fact is clearly otherwise . upon the wife and dowry question , substituting coin for cows . we have assuredly nothing of the zulu kaffir left . the endurance of despotism is one great distinguishing mark of a savage always .
but this was not their last glimpse of the supposed guardians of thelawrence . as the ship proceeded farther up the beautiful river , they saw one morning a boat come forth from the woods . bearing three men dressed to look like devils , wrapped in dogs skins , white and black , their faces besmeared as black as any coals , with horns on their heads more than a yard long . and as this boat passed the ship , one of the men made a long address .
but the niece was perfectly happy in having found him a real living person . and -- since they lived happily ever after -- here the story ends , `` and another begins , '' added the story lady , after a slight pause . [male] , king of sicily , was a very proud monarch and a very selfish one . he spent most of his time enjoying himself .
this he agreed to , but put on her this iron belt and chain . the other end of which he fastened round his own waist . and the great noises that were heard when the king cut the chain must have been caused by the giant 's falling down the underground passage when the chain gave way so suddenly . the giant 's dwelling , indeed , was right under the palace . and the terrible shakings must have been caused by him in his death throes .
my senses were overcome by the smell of the fairy odours . and the scent of the flowers , and the sweet perfume of honey . with which the walls of the house seemed bursting . and my head fell forward and i slept , how long i dozed i do not know . but when i woke i saw that all the little spriggans were glaring at me angrily .
she was on her feet the same instant . with her great tail sticking out straight behind her , just as it had been lying . `` good dog , '' said the princess , and patted her head . [female] wagged her tail solemnly , like the boom of an anchored sloop . [male] took the crown , and laid it where the king would see it when he woke .
the basket work is all crude . with the possible exception of some of the hats worn by the men . as is brought forth later under the head of `` commerce , '' much basket work is done by only one or two communities . and from them passes in trade over a large area . most of the basket work of the area is of bejuco or [male] .
this wish was no sooner uttered than [male] . much to his astonishment , saw that the lovely princess had been turned into a white swan . with a small gold crown on the top of its head . expanding her wings , she gradually rose high above him . attended by the pigeons , and all three flew out to sea ; when suddenly [male] observed a magnificent ship not far from the coast .
he felt in the right hand pocket of his father 's coat . and there , sure enough , he found the dried windpipe of a goose . he took that and he took a pot of burning peat . and covered it over so it would keep hot ; and he took also a big kitchen knife . then he went out and led feetgong from the stable , he sprang upon his back and slapped him on the right shoulder .
`` heaven reward such kindness , '' cried [female] , and handing over the cow . received in exchange the pig , who was turned out of his wheelbarrow and was to be led by a string . so on went [male] , thinking how everything turned out according to his wishes . and how , if trouble overtook him . all was sure to be set right directly , after a while he fell in with a peasant .
the news of the slaughter was at once told by [male] ( for so long as homicide was not concealed it was not considered murder ) . and told fairly , so that all men praised [male] for his brave defence . and lamented his death , but when men sought for the fair [female] she could not be found . and was seen no more from that day , she had loved [male] greatly . had seen him fall , and could not live when he was dead ; but no man knew where she died or was buried .
in this manner did the innocent maidens endeavour to lighten the hours of captivity which passed over their heads . and when , upon the second week of their imprisonment , they were moved into larger and more airy apartments . hope at once revived within their drooping bosoms , it must . however , be confessed , that in the midst of their distress both [person] and chinks contemplated with silent but real satisfaction the probably speedy advent of [person] to join them in their prison . and share their sorrows , this event they both regarded as quite certain to occur .
they reached the palace at last , and the emperor led [male] into the hall . and sent a messenger for [male] , his daughter . `` i shall care for him willingly , '' answered [female] , and she took him away . and saw that supper was set before him , and clothes provided for him . and made him ready for his duties as page to the emperor .
well , the prince set off at once , and after two days journey he came to the wood around the castle . and he climbed the tree that was nearest to the window that looked towards the sunset . and he shook the branches , as soon as he did so . the window opened and he saw the princess [female] . looking lovelier than ever , he was going to call out her name , but she placed her fingers on her lips .
algates ye are our prey become . this many a day and night right instantly of god we have craved to be vouchsafed your sight . so hath the merciful towards [male] driven you . a champion ruling over all , a lion of great might . is there a man of you will come , that i may heal his paint with blows right profitful for him who 's sick for lust of fight ?
for a moment a fierce rain of blows ensued . then the clear bugle note from [person] ordered a retreat . the two warders at the nearest gate tried to close it . but were shot dead in their tracks , [person] of doncaster threw a third soldier into the moat . and out through the gate went the foresters in good order .
he began with the norsemen and descended through queen [female] and [female] and the [location] . making a détour of sir [male] and his cloak . [male] , [male] and pocahontas . and so by way of valley forge and the [location] to [organization] and the spirit of 1776 . it was a grand flight , filled with what were afterward freely referred to as magnificent passages about the storm .
trotting about late at night in silk stockings . and getting wet more than once in the winter rains , gave [male] a bad cold . no one cared for it ; and he was soon as hoarse as a crow . his master forced him to sing several times in spite of the pain he suffered . and when at the last concert he broke down completely , [male] at him for `` a useless brat , ''
with a wave of his candle all three miracles were wrought . for the snow flakes turned to a white fur cloak and [female] on [female] 's head and shoulders . a bowl of hot soup came sailing to her lips . and vanished when she had eagerly drunk the last drop ; and suddenly the dismal field changed to a new world so full of wonders that all her troubles were forgotten in a minute . bells were ringing so merrily that it was hard to keep from dancing , green garlands hung on the walls .
well , soon after that it happened that the young lord of the castle came home . and there was to be a grand ball in honour of the occasion . and when they were speaking about it among the servants . `` dear me , mrs. [female] , '' said [female] . `` how much i should like to go , '' now when the day of the ball arrived .
but she did not come that morning , nor that day . nor for many days , you shall hear it all . the children laid the fire , together , -- shivering but hopeful , [male] got the breakfast . teaching [male] , so that next time he could help . they chattered and played a good deal , and really had quite a merry time over it .
i am going to tell a story , one of those tales of astonishing adventures that happened years and years and years ago . perhaps you wonder why it is that so many stories are told of `` once on a time '' and so few of these days in which we live ; but that is easily explained . in the old days , when the world was young , there were no automobiles nor flying machines to make one wonder . nor were there railway trains , nor telephones .
while sitting over his nets this evening , unsuspicious of any evil , a sudden fear came upon him . at the sound of a rustling in the gloom of the forest . as of a horse and rider , the noise approaching nearer and nearer to the little promontory . all that he had dreamed , in many a stormy night , of the mysteries of the forest . now flashed at once through his mind ; foremost of all , the image of a gigantic [male] man .

he could not get the notion out of his head that something was wrong . had not everybody , near and far , said that [male] had fallen overboard ? my grandfather was sorry enough . and he vowed he would not do so again , he was unslinging himself from the pole now . and his eyes glared and his teeth glistened , my grandfather got up in haste and ran off into the gloomy wood . he stumbled over stones , the brambles tore his clothes .
when they came to the house , [male] crept into the chamber . and cried out with all his might , `` will you have all that is here ? '' the thieves were terrified , and said , `` speak gently , or some one will awake . '' but [male] feigned not to understand , and exclaimed , louder still , `` will you have all that is here ? '' this awoke the cook , who slept in the room , and sitting up in her bed she listened .
so the king gave out , that if anyone could tell such a string of lies as would get her to say . `` that 's a story , '' he should have her to wife . and half the kingdom besides , well , many came , as you may fancy . to try their luck , for everyone would have been very glad to have the princess . to say nothing of the kingdom ; but they all cut a sorry figure .
thereat the prophetess , knowing that her questioner could be none other than [male] . for to no mortal man could be known so much of the future , refused for evermore to speak . and returned to the silence of her tomb , and [male] was forced to mount his steed and to return to his own land of warmth and pleasure . on his return he found that all was well with [male] . thus he tried to still his anxious heart and to forget the feast in the chill regions of [location] .
both the combatants made ready for the fray : [male] was armed with a sword and a shield like a cart wheel and was skilful at sword play . while [male] 's weapon was the quarter staff , the day arrived and [male] girded up his loins and set out . twirling his staff round his head , now his father and mother were both dead . but on the road his mother met him in the guise of an old woman . so that he did not recognise her , she greeted him and asked where he was going and when she heard that it was to fight [female] she said my son .
a long flight of marble steps led up to the entrance . the knight took [person] by the hand . and up they went , ever so high , together , at the top stood two soldiers in armour . they saluted , and the door of the castle opened as if by magic . they found themselves in a great hall .
[female] laid her hand upon the boy 's shoulder and spoke to him . it had not been very difficult for her to pick up a few chinese phrases . would he not like to come to her school and see some pretty pictures ? pat shook his ruddy curls and looked at pan . would pan come too ? yes , pan would , pan 's memory was good .
so he went out and shot ten more snow birds ; for in this business he was very expert . and he had a new bird skin coat made , which was prettier than the one he had worn before . or there was never in the whole world a more mischievous busy body than that notorious giant [male] . he was everywhere , in season and out of season . running about and putting his hand in whatever was going forward , to carry on his game .
`` look , look , '' cried the boatman and he pointed out to sea . the king looked , and then first he saw [male] in the boat . sailing away toward the monster , -- for before his eyes had been dim with sorrow . and he had seen naught but what was close before him , the king looked . and all the court looked with him , and a great cry arose .
two nights afterwards , other men . armed with knives and muskets , came into our tent . they were albanians , brave men . my mother told me , they only stayed a short time . my sister [female] sat on the knee of one of them .
and they caused the boy to be baptised , and the ceremony was performed there . and the name which they gave unto him was [male] . because what hair was upon his head was as yellow as gold . and they had the boy nursed in the court until he was a year old . and before the year was over he could walk stoutly ; and he was larger than a boy of three years old .
when the good old man saw that the dog , whom he had lent . did not come home , he went next door to ask what had become of him . and the wicked old man answered that he had killed the dog . and buried him at the root of a pine tree ; so the good old fellow . with , a heavy heart , went to the spot , and , having set out a tray with delicate food .
when he was at a distance from the forest , it looked like a dark cloud . but as he came nearer it began to grow rosy , all the boughs and briers had begun to [male] . by the time he was close to them they were in full flower . and when he reached the edge of the forest the branches divided . leaving an open path before him , along this path the prince rode and before long he came to the palace .
on the day of the jousts the trumpets began to blow in the field where they should be held . king [male] sat on a great scaffold which was raised at one end . to judge who did best in the jousting , so great was the press of folk . both noble and common , earls and chiefs , that many did marvel to think that the realm of [location] held so many people . the knights held themselves in two parties and went to either end of the lists .
now they travelled about for a while , but could find no situations where they could remain together . so they said , there is nothing else for it . we must part , they divided the animals . so that each of them had a lion , a bear . a wolf , a fox , and a [person] .
the two others laid themselves at his feet . by this time the thunder was rolling up relentlessly , and the flashes shone green and sinister . the storm was not long in breaking over them , the rain swished in from the west the way of [male] 's right side . he wrapped his head in his five shilling blanket . its cotton waste was not very waterproof , he had a few more draws at his pipe in the dark .
[male] he took for sir [male] . chiefly by reason of the page [male] . with the iron flail , whom he had seen in his company . the next day , so soon as it was light , [female] departed . and when the two knights would have stayed her going , and this on the bridge where [female] had fought pollenté .
but the boy , who was named [male] , looked with still greater pleasure and longing at some old fire arms which hung upon the rafters . under the ceiling of the room , his grandfather promised him that he should have them some day . but that he must first grow big and strong , and learn how to use them . small as he was , the goats were placed in his care . and a good goat keeper should also be a good climber , and such [male] was .
on the way thither she saw so much of him . and found him so charming , that [female] might have married her himself had he chosen . but he would not have been false to his master for all the beauties under the sun . at length they arrived at the king 's city . and the fair one with golden locks became his spouse and queen .
the king gave the signal , and as the chief bard of erin was seen ascending the mound in front of the royal inclosures he was greeted with a roar of cheers . but at the first note of his harp silence like that of night fell on the mighty gathering . in the height of the debate the cry arose that another competitor had ascended the mound . and there standing in view of all was [male] , the huntsman 's son . all eyes were fastened upon him , but no one looked so eagerly as the princess .
whenever sir [male] met him about the hall or the kitchen he would laugh mockingly . and to those about him he would say , `` well , how like you my huge boy of the kitchen ? '' but to such sneers , and to all the scorns and insults of the varlets of the kitchen . [male] would answer naught , and was ever quiet and mild whatever he endured . and to all was he ever [male] , both man and child .
meanwhile the [organization] continued flying straight towards the sun , which was getting lower and lower . so that by the time they reached the mountains it was dark altogether . but the [organization] didn t seem at all afraid of the darkness . and just went on flying as if nothing had happened , until suddenly it let the princess down on a rock—at least . that was what it seemed to her to be , not knowing what else to do .
here dwelt [male] , the god of love . in whose arms [male] deposited his lovely burden . [male] , himself unseen , wooed her in the softest accents of affection . but warned her , as she valued his love . not to endeavour to behold his form , for some time [female] was obedient to the injunction of her immortal spouse .
the captain , having lost two brave fellows of his troop . was afraid of diminishing it too much by pursuing this plan to get information of the residence of their plunderer . he found by their example that their heads were not so good as their hands on such occasions . and therefore resolved to take upon himself the important commission . accordingly , he went and addressed himself to [male] .
the poor old man had done every thing in his power to have his house brightened and filled with joy by what he himself so greatly desired . he had given alms to the convents and churches . he had had liturgies read in seven churches . had sent for priests with white beards , because they are the holiest men and have more earnestness in prayer . and had had masses read for all the saints and prayers for the last unction .
the significant thing to keep in mind is that , for twentieth century readers . the best fables are not merely the best ones ever written , but the best ones re written . in other words , the fable was for centuries an old story in a rough state . and the writers who have made it most interesting are the writers who told it over again in a manner that makes it art . a greek named [male] , of whom almost nothing is known .
this was the good fairy who had given him the flying frog carriage . so again she resolved to help him if she could . away she went to the fairy [female] and asked her to release the spell on prince charming . [male] agreed to do so if he would marry [male] . then the good fairy conducted prince charming back to his castle .
`` you can see for yourself , '' said the mother . then [male] ran to the hearth and peeped into the dish . but as he stretched his neck too far over it . the steam caught him and carried him up the chimney . for a time he floated with the steam about in the air .
for it was not the prince 's fault that he was so clever . the cruel fairy had made him so . but , even if the prince had been born clever , was he to be blamed for that ? the other people were just as much in fault for being born so stupid ; but the world . my dear children , can never be induced to remember this , if you are clever .
now when the little dwarf heard that he was to dance a second time before the infanta . and by her own express command , he was so proud that he ran out into the garden . kissing the white rose in an absurd ecstasy of pleasure , and making the most uncouth and clumsy gestures of delight . the flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude into their beautiful home , and when they saw him capering up and down the walks . and waving his arms above his head in such a ridiculous manner .
it having been shown that [male] 's diabolical scheme . so far as the abduction went , was carried out with entire success , pass we now a month . [male] has established himself in the capital . having provided [male] with an elegant suite of apartments . under the same roof with himself , although not immediately adjoining , his behavior to her was studiously kind .
she repeatedly called the girl 's name before reaching the marble bench . but always in vain , when she had at last reached the [female] grove . which had concealed the lovers from her eyes , she could not help beholding the unwelcome sight . [female] was resting her head on [male] 's breast . while he bent down and kissed her eyes , her mouth .
all sorts of deceptions are used to lure folk into the mountain gorges . then the [male] comes along and devours his victim , and the new spirit must serve as his decoy . the old spirit 's time of service is over and it may go . and so it continues , turn by turn . probably that is why they say of people who are forced to yield themselves up to cunning and powerful men .
with that the little fellow made a powerful great lep out of the cradle . across the floor and away with him out over the fields . but he left his fiddle behind , and the master of the house threw it down on the burning turf . and that was no true fiddle at all , only a piece of an old bog stick was rotten with age . there was a wild sort of a lad the name of [male] pat .
he walked thus seventeen days , his only food a few raw herbs . and he slept at night in some ruined palace . amongst the wild cats and pharaoh 's rats . with which mingled sometimes , women whose bodies ended in a scaly tail . but [male] knew that these women came from hell .
if that be so , then [location] is undeniably the original cradle of [male] in boots . but m. [male] has been unable to find any [male] in boots in [location] . at least he knew none in 1876 , when he wrote on the subject in le français . nor did the learned [male] , with all his prodigious erudition , know an indian [male] in boots . therefore the proof of this theory , that buddhistic [location] may be the real cat 's cradle , is incomplete .
now , as the judge was not really a bad man , he decided to humour the old woman in her strange plea . turning to the assistants in the court room he asked which of them would be willing to go in search of the [male] . one of these men , named [male] , had been leaning against the wall , half asleep . he had been drinking heavily and so had not heard what had been going on in the room . one of his friends gave him a poke in the ribs just as the judge asked for volunteers .
but flying soot did not tarry to argue the matter , he wrenched free his mantle . and hurried away to seek curling smoke , leaving the ash goblin to nurse his wrath at his leisure . wavering and swaying in the plain beyond the dark hill where flying soot had first beheld him . hung curling smoke , the grey magician , in all the land of the evil fairies there were few who possessed such power as he . or were so ready to wield it , even at this moment he was watching craftily for a chance to work ill upon whoever might come his way .
[female] , hearing this , woke and rose hastily , and , looking about , saw in the moonlight king [male] . and many fairies with him dressed in green silk . and all these did welcome [male] into their company , king [male] took [male] by the hand and led him a dance . and near by sat little [male] , the fairy piper . no bigger than a plum , his bagpipe was made of a [male] 's quill and the skin of a tiny bug .
the princess went with her sisters to the window and looked on at the tournament . presently her husband rode by and threw the apple up to her . she caught it in her hand and went with it to her room . and by and by her husband came back to her , but her father was much surprised that she did not seem to care about any of the princes . he therefore appointed a second tournament , the crab then gave his wife the same directions as before .
we have seen a swan beat with his wings upon the marble crag . so that it burst , and the forms of beauty imprisoned in the stone stepped out to the sunny day . and men in the lands round about lifted up their heads to behold these mighty forms . centuries will pass by , swans will fly forth from the nest , men will see them and hear them in the world . before it shall be said in spirit and in truth .
in a house , with a large courtyard , in a provincial town . at that time of the year in which people say the evenings are growing longer . a family circle were gathered together at their old home . a lamp burned on the table , although the weather was mild and warm . and the long curtains hung down before the open windows , and without the moon shone brightly in the dark blue sky .
home is no longer home to me . now ye are gone away , nor are the neighbours neighbours now , after our parting day . the comrade , whom i loved whilere , no more a comrade is , and even the very sun and moon no longer bright are they , ye went away and all the world was saddened for your loss . and all the hills and plains grew dark with sorrow and dismay .
the preceding observations will have given a sufficient account of the mythology of the norsemen . and of the way in which it fell , they came from the east . and brought that common stock of tradition with them . settled in the scandinavian peninsula , they developed themselves through heathenism . romanism , and lutheranism , in a locality little exposed to foreign influence .
the farmer was an old bachelor , and there was no one in the house with him but his niece and the servants . he and his niece were just finishing supper when the fairies entered . and on seeing this sprightly winked knowingly at his companions , and they all stood quietly aside until the old man should be asleep and their duties would begin . they had not long to wait , farmer grubbins pushed back his chair with a remark to his niece upon the supper . to the effect that the beefsteak pie had been uncommon good .
but when it joins itself in this way to its companions . from whom it was parted for a time , does it come back clear and transparent as it left them ? from the iceberg it does indeed return pure and clear . for the fairy crystallization will have no impurities . not even salt , in her ice crystals , and so as they melt they give back nothing but pure water to the sea .
mr. [male] meets a more orthodox end . dying quietly in his old age , mr. [male] was a gentler saint than mr. [male] . he had also faced the humiliation of displacement from his post of service . in the warden , accepting his fate with quietness and resignation . there are few more sympathetic portraits of the loneliness of the aged than that of mr. [male] finishing his days wandering about the rooms of his daughter 's house .
at last they reached the jogi 's palace and every day he taught them incantations and spells . he bought them each a water pot and sent them every morning to fill it with dew . but before they collected enough , the sun came out and dried up the dew . one day they got a cupful . another day half a cupful , but they never were able to fill the pots .
`` nothing except marriage , '' answered the king . and he invited all the handsomest young men he could think of to the palace . and bade the princess choose a husband from among them . it took her some time to decide which she admired the most . but at last she fixed upon a young prince , whose eyes were like the pools in the forest .
by the time he got up the area steps . three or four women who had seen him go down were standing together at the top waiting for him . they wanted his clothes for their children . but they did not follow him down lest sal should find them there . the moment he appeared , they laid their hands on him .
`` she is not half awake yet , '' said her grandmother as [female] 's mother took her in her arms and kissed her . [female] kept her promise , even if she did dream about grandmother great talking to her . and the right hand forefinger did not get her into any more trouble , [female] hicks often looks at the portraits in the hall of grandmother and grandfather great . but grandmother great never has spoken to her since that day , but [female] hicks smiles at her and sometimes the eyes seem to smile back . and [female] wonders if they really do .
but the old man adopted a son , and his family grew rich and prosperous . what a happy old man , a long time ago , at a temple called morinji . in the province of joshiu , there was an old tea kettle . one day , when the priest of the temple was about to hang it over the hearth to boil the water for his tea . to his amazement , the kettle all of a sudden put forth the head and tail of a badger .
days passed , weeks grew into months . and still princess [female] 's kingdom looked like one large bedchamber . the people snored in the streets , the brave army lying in the fields slept soundly . hidden in the long grass under the shadow of nettle , wormwood , and [female] . rust and dust marring the brightness of their armour .
a person who is over curious , and wants to know more than he ought , always carries the match in his hand to set fire to the powder room of his own fortunes . and he who pries into others affairs is frequently a loser in his own . for generally he who digs holes to search for treasures . comes to a ditch into which he himself falls . as happened to the daughter of a gardener in the following manner .
she unfortunately had an only son , who , for stupidity and laziness . had yet to find his equal , he would lie in bed till noon . and when he did resolve to rise , he took a full hour to rub his eyes . and then he would be nearly as long stretching his arms and legs . in short , he behaved like the veriest sluggard upon earth .
in the mean time , the prince of [location] . unwilling to lose such an opportunity of shewing his good breeding and gallantry . adjusted the cushion of cloth of gold . for the lady to lean on ; after which he hastily retired , that she might sit down . and having saluted her , by kissing the carpet under her feet .
one beautiful may day in old [female] . a young girl fell asleep at noonday on an elfin mound . the fairies saw how pretty she was , so they carried her off to fairyland . and left in her stead an image that looked exactly like her , evening fell . and as the girl did not return home , her mother sent the neighbours to look for her in all directions .
the more greedy of them stooped to pick it up . the philosopher , pleased at his first success , adroitly threw deniers and drachmas here and there . at the sound of the pieces of money rattling on the pavement . the persecutors of [male] threw themselves on the ground . beggars , slaves , and tradespeople scrambled after the money .
but so much more painful and sad was the change as her bad time came on . the more beautiful she was in the full moon , the more withered and worn did she become as the moon waned . at the time at which my story has now arrived , she looked . when the moon was small or gone , like an old woman exhausted with suffering . this was the more painful that her appearance was unnatural ; for her hair and eyes did not change .
another is a hot water test , an egg is placed in an olla of boiling water . and each suspect is obliged to pick it out with his hand . when the guilty man draws out the egg the hot water leaps up and burns the forearm . there is an egg test said to be the surest one of all , a battle ax blade is held at an angle of about 60 degrees . and an egg is placed at the top in a position to slide down .
the amadan thanked her , parted with her . and travelled away and away before him until he reached the hill which she had told him of . and when he came there , he saw a great cloud that shot out of the sky . descending on the hill , and when it came down on the hill and melted away . there it left the beggarman of the king of sweden standing .
he sprang back with a cry of horror ... beneath the long lashes he saw that the woman was looking at him . and yet ... oh , what was it ? what horrible nightmare was this ? ... she was looking . she was staring ... yes , she was staring with sightless eyes . eyes out of which the light of life had gone for ever , for ever !
the two elder sisters looked with invidious eyes on betsie . as they also were very much smitten with the handsome lad . betsie was very happy after , so happy that if anyone doubt it he can satisfy himself with his own eyes . if she is still alive , let him go and look for her . and try to find her in this big world , a poor widow had a son who was so courageous that not even the devil 's mother would have frightened him .
whither they sailed , my children . i can not clearly tell , it all happened long ago ; so long that it has all grown dim . like a dream which you dreamt last year . and why they went i can not tell : some say that it was to win gold . it may be so ; but the noblest deeds which have been done on earth have not been done for gold .
as soon as [female] went into the stable , he spied a little donkey lying on a bed of straw in the corner of the stable . he was worn out from hunger and too much work . after looking at him a long time , he said to himself . `` i know that donkey , i have seen him before . '' and bending low over him , he asked : `` who are you ? ''
with words like these she beguiled and coaxed the queen until she let down the silken cord and drew the gipsy up . once on the throne , the wicked gipsy combed out the golden tresses and plaited them and arranged them until the queen fell sound asleep . then the gipsy took the pin and stuck it into the queen 's head . instantly a beautiful white dove flew off the golden throne and not a trace was left of the lovely queen except her rich clothing . the gipsy dressed herself in this , sat in the queen 's place .
how could he dare to go into the water now , after [male] 's dream ! he never would do it , for this dream always satisfied him . the parents of these children , who were poor , often sat together while [female] and [female] played in the gardens or in the road . along this road -- a row of willow trees had been planted to separate it from a ditch on one side of it . they were not very handsome trees , for the tops had been cut off .
whether doctor [male] were holding converse with the broom . or the peruke , or a spectre whom he , and no one else could see [female] could not tell . but she had then recovered herself sufficiently to be able to listen attentively , she crossed herself several times for the sake of greater safety . and what she heard from the doctor 's own mouth remained a secret between her and [female] . [female] had long been in bed , and his snoring greeted her as she entered .
when he came home , gorged and unwieldy , he showed no inclination to play . but lay down to sleep , once the little girl wished to rouse him from his slumber . and seized him somewhat roughly by the ears , the creature uttered a loud roar . reared on his hind legs , showing his teeth , and when the unsuspecting child stretched out her hand . laughing to her refractory playfellow , she was suddenly struck down by a blow from one of its paws .
father bear ran along till he came to a hill at the skirt of the forest . where he could see the big noise shop , here he lay down and placed the boy in front of him . holding him securely between his forepaws , now look down at that big noise shop ! ', he commanded . the great ironworks , with many tall buildings , stood at the edge of a waterfall . high chimneys sent forth dark clouds of smoke .
it drifted slowly away over the sea , and at last became as a bright star . further and further off , until it vanished in the depths of the sky . then a great coldness fell upon [male] , and the daylight became dusky to him . as if it were already evening ; and he knew that the dazzling face which he had seen was the face of his father . now he understood what the book had been ; but it was too late .
`` empress of rome , all hail ! '' [female] wledig said ; and the princess bent forward in her chair and kissed him . for she knew he was her destined husband . the next day they were wedded , and the emperor [female] wledig gave [female] as dowry all [location] for her father . the son of the gallant [female] , and for herself three castles .
they were at the foot of the mountain . but the people no longer feared them , for now they were not warriors but rocks . to keep from harm those whom he loved , the manito had made the warriors into stone . they stood at the foot of the mountain . and today , if you should go to that far-away country .
son and mother once more faced poverty and loneliness . and [male] again splashed barelegged in the rice field . a poor milkwoman was once going into the town with cans full of milk to sell . she took with her her little daughter ( a baby of about a year old ) . having no one in whose charge to leave her at home .
in a map drawn by the [female] physician . [male] , which was sent by him to [male] in 1474 to give his impression of the asiatic coast . lying , as he supposed , across the atlantic , -- there appears the island ofbrandan . it is as large as all the azores or canary islands or cape de verde islands put together . its southern tip just touches the equator , and it lies about half-way between the cape de verde islands and zipangu or [location] .
so saying , the king led him from the hall through long rooms . in which mountains of gold , silver , and copper were piled . in other rooms lay like masses of precious stones . presently they came to a grotto , in the centre of which stood a large vase . from out this vase poured three sparkling streams , each of a different colour .
diamond had taken a great deal of pains and trouble to find [male] . and had at last succeeded through the help of the tall policeman , who was glad to renew his acquaintance with the strange child . [male] had moved his quarters , and had not heard of nanny 's illness till some time after she was taken to the hospital . where he was too shy to go and inquire about her , but when at length she went to live with diamond 's family . [female] was willing enough to go and see her , it was after one of his visits .
the same [female] voice that sung the mystic rune . that helped the child bearing woman , or drew the arrow head from the dying champion 's breast . the same bright eye that gazed up to heaven in ecstacy through the sacred grove and read the will of the gods when the mystic tablets and rune carved lots were cast . all these , if the will were bad , if the soothsayer passed into the false prophetess . the leech into a poisoner , and the priestess into a witch .
but the next day came , and a second , and a third , and there was no possibility of thinking of work . not till a week had passed could he rise from his bed . when he came out of the hurt , he uttered a cry of surprise . the red and yellow leaves still hung on the trees , but a thin coverlet of snow lay over the whole face of the clearing . in the air the snow flakes crossed and whirled in white confusion .
after this he had many perilous adventures ; he fought with giants and lions . he entered an enchanted castle and escaped ; he went to a well in the forest . and , striking three times on a cymbal with a hammer hung there for the purpose . called forth a great giant , whom he slew . afterwards marrying his daughter , then he went to rescue the queen of the realm .
the woods were a never-ending marvel of red , gold , and brown . on the freshly reaped maize fields the indian corn lay in small pyramids of ripest orange . the peasants sat about in groups singing the songs of harvest . whilst the early night did its best to hurry the glowing sunsets out of the flaming sky . always smaller grew the hope in our wanderer 's heart .
it was the message from her lover . she knew not what to do , should she go to the fountain where lovers meet beneath the moon ? in her doubt she snatched first one dove and then the other . kissing each in turn , then , setting them down , she rose and swiftly clothed herself in a long cloak . and stole quietly down the stairs and out of the palace by a side door .
the maidens had sweet thanks , and the doughty warriors took their leave right courteously . and bright eyes were dim and wet with tears , i ween her heart told her the dole that was to come . and they wept all together , and refused to be comforted , till the gold on their breasts was wet with the tears that rolled down from their eyes . they carried down the shields of ruddy gold to the strand . and stowed their armour in the vessel , and let fetch their horses .
after dinner , [male] and [male] . in order to draw some attention towards themselves . sang a duet , they sang indeed admirably and accompanied themselves on the harp . [female] who was truly good and wished her sister to love her . applauded them rapturously and complimented them on their talent .
he laughed at her , and posted off in high glee . throwing his ball before him and running after it at full speed . and he went as fast as his ball , at last his ball flew to a great distance . he followed as fast as he could , after he had run forward for some time . he saw what seemed four dark spots upon the ice .
so the next night as the dark began to fall they all trooped out into the marshes . each with a stone in his mouth and a twig of the witch hazel in his hands . never a word they spoke , but kept straight on ; and , i am telling you . there was not one among them but had the creeps and the starts . they could see nothing around them but bogs and pools and snags .
now [male] was the name his companions had given him . because he had a favourite stone covered with moss . on which he used to sit whole days reading . and they said the moss had begun to grow upon him too . [male] held out his hand , the moment the lady saw that it was the golden key .
but patiently she bore with them , and when they told her they could never perform so hard a task . and must dwell for ever in the dark forest , she answered gently . that the [female] must be planted , and watered with repentant tears , before the robe of innocence could be won . that the sun of love must shine in their hearts . before the light could return to their dim crowns .
`` good morning , [female] , '' said she . and [female] was more surprised than ever , for he could not imagine how she had learned his name . but he soon found that she knew a great deal more about him than his name . for she told him how , when he was quite a little baby . his father , a gallant knight , had been slain by the giant who lived in yonder castle .
about this time [female] sets out to pay his long-lost brother a visit . finding him dead , he searches for his heart . but searches in vain for three years . in the fourth year , however , it suddenly becomes desirous of returning to [location] . and says , `` i will leave this celestial sphere .

the cloth being taken away , [female] having occasion to go out . took an opportunity when the queen did not observe him . he descended into the court , and seeing the garden door open , went into it . being tempted by the pleasantness of the place , he walked there for some time . at last he came to a fountain , where he washed his face and hands to refresh himself .
at last , when she had sat there for well nigh an hour , a curious change began to pass over the landscape . first it turned grey , and then it turned a deep azure blue . as if the sky had descended on the earth , oh , woe a day , in a moment a mystic spell fell upon her . which caused her to become invisible to the eyes of the prince of norroway . who , having vanquished the evil spirit , was loosed from the spell which had lain over him .
she rose , stretched her hands toward the great bright sun . and prayed that her footsteps might be guided aright , she stooped to lift the tiny blossoms that lay beside her and . searching among them for the largest flowers , tucked a spray into her dress . then she started down the hillside in the direction [female] had taken so long ago . she followed his trail faithfully as far as she could recall it .
and all the heroes pressed round , and vowed to her that she should be their queen . and [female] laughed for joy , and clapped his hands . because the choice had fallen on him ; for in those days poets and singers were as bold warriors as the best . so at midnight they went up the bank . and found [female] ; and beside came [female] her young brother .
in the clerk 's office of the district court of [location] for [location] of [location] . no word contains more than four letters , and none is over one syllable in length . so that any child who has the least knowledge of reading will be able to enjoy it for himself . once on a time , a poor boy was seen to go up and down the side walk of a town . and sob and cry , at last he sat down on a door step .
one still golden star hung on the fringe of the sun glow . the stairs began to widen , and presently [male] found himself at the summit of the mountain . before his eyes lay a little level field surrounded by strange crags and pinnacles . looming tall and black against the fast appearing stars , and as [male] rubbed his eyes in wonder . lights shone here and there in the sides of the towering rocks .
she crept up to the stove and unburdened her heart to it . the king stood outside by the pipes of the stove and heard all she said . then he came back , and caused royal robes to be put upon her . and her beauty was a marvel , then he called his son and told him that he had a false bride . but that the true bride was here , the prince was charmed with her beauty and a great banquet was prepared .
away flew the factor , while another dinner was providing , and returned with the cat just as the rats and mice were devouring that also . he immediately put down miss [female] . who killed a great number of them , the king rejoiced greatly to see his old enemies destroyed by so small a creature . and the queen was highly pleased , and desired the cat might be brought near that she might look at her . upon which the factor called [female] .
the young prince listened to his mother , and obeyed her for some time . but one day , when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go . he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth side . and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side . when he got there , he found himself in a jungle .
these things have been of the very essence of civilisation . therefore [female] in boots must have been invented by a more or less civilised mind . it could not have been invented by a man in the condition of the fuegians or the digger indians . nay , when we consider the stress always and everywhere laid in the story on snobbish pride and on magnificence of attire and equipment . and on retinue , we may conclude that [male] in boots could hardly have been imagined by men in the middle barbarism .
in the belly of the fish was his wife . with a golden saucer in her hand , and a silver [female] on her foot . and a little son in her arms , then the [male] embraced his wife . and kissed his son , and brought them both to the palace . and heard the tale of it all to the very end .
and [female] danced on and on , till he really could dance no more . and was obliged to stop , with these words he and the other dwarfs vanished . and [male] , putting his hands to his face . found to his great joy that his cheeks were reduced to their natural size . the way home seemed short and easy to him .
the princess [female] and prince [male] rose next morning as soon as it was light . but the princess would no more put on her royal robes as king . she dressed herself in her natural dress . that of a woman , and then sent the chief eunuch to king [female] . her father in law , to desire he would take the trouble to come to her apartment .
presently as she stood [female] in the dark . wondering if help would come , she heard something calling in the distance . calling , calling , and then dying away with a sob , till the marshes were full of this pitiful crying sound . then she heard steps floundering along , squishing in the mud and slipping on the tufts . and through the darkness she saw a white face with great feared eyes .
`` more tricks , '' he said to himself . `` it is of no use to stab this one , i must wait till i see what can be done . '' still he heard [male] calling him . and still he followed , as well as he could , at length he came to a doorway . open to the air , through which the moonlight fell , but when he reached it .
then they laughed and made good cheer , and either drank to other . thinking never drink was so sweet or so good , but after they had drunk that magic wine . they loved either other so truly that never their love departed either for weal or for woe . so they sailed on till by fortune they came into cornwall . there all the barons met them , and [male] and the fair [male] were richly wedded with great splendour .
gerda was obliged to rest again , and just opposite the place where she sat . she saw a great crow come hopping across the snow toward her . he stood looking at her for some time , and then he wagged his head and said . `` caw , caw ; good day , good day , '' he pronounced the words as plainly as he could . because he meant to be kind to the little girl .
somehow she did not feel so hungry now , and that was a blessing , there was the stately mansion all ablaze with light . she could look in through the rich [female] curtains of the grand parlor window . and see the beautiful christmas tree , and the happy children dancing around it . it was very near the belfry , and she sat down on the broad steps . and , wrapping her shawl about her , listened to the wonderful chimes .
but the twins ran straight on till they reached their own home . then they told their father all that they had suffered . and he was so angry with their step mother that he drove her out of the house . and never let her return ; but he and the children lived happily together . and he took care of them himself .
but when she saw the serpent coiled round it . she was afraid to kill her own son along with it . so she said to her son : son , son ! show me , at least , the girl 's little finger . and then i ll leave you both in peace.
the queen , transported with joy , embraced all the fairies . spent the day with them , and returned , laden with presents . to the fountain side ; where the little old woman jumped into the water . became a cray fish again , and disappeared , in due time the princess [female] was born . and the queen did as she was told in naming the flowers .
had made his customary proclamation , to wit : his good-will and [male] to all his tenantry . and if any man , woman , child , or other person . caused his daughter , miss [female] , to hear anything about the legend . such tale bearer should be chained to a tree , and kept fat until the dragon found him and ate him . so everybody obligingly kept the baron 's secret .
foremost are the men of smyrna who say that he was the son of meles . the river of their town , by a nymph [male] . and that he was at first called [male] , he was named [male] later . when he became blind , this being their usual epithet for such people . the chians , on the other hand , bring forward evidence to show that he was their countryman .
then the merchant came up to complain of the death of his baby . and the poor man again brandished his heavy towel before the judge . and because he hoped for another bribe the judge said . you must send your wife to the poor man 's house till she has another baby . and then you will be as well off as before , then the son came and accused the poor man of having crushed his father to death .
though the players went along the ice at a fearful pace . yet i did not observe a single person fall . on taking our seat in the aërial carriage , the prince informed me that we should not stop again until arriving at our journey 's end . and that on passing a rocky headland we could see in the distance . we should have a capital view of the city of the plain .
in the morning sir [male] made himself ready to depart . and the maid [female] lingered long about her brother . and would never say that she had really buckled the last strap of his armour . then , when at length she could keep them no longer . she came up to sir [female] , with a face all pale and red by turns .
on the east side of the dwarf hill of dardesheim there is a piece of arable land . a smith named [male] had sown this field with peas . but he observed that when they were just in [male] they were pulled in great quantities . [male] built himself a little hut on his ground . there to lie in wait for the thief ; and there he watched day and night .
she now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood . where large , fat water snakes were rolling in the mire , and showing their ugly , drab colored bodies . in the midst of this spot stood a house . built with the bones of shipwrecked human beings , there sat the sea witch . allowing a toad to eat from her mouth , just as people sometimes feed a canary with a piece of sugar .
as soon as [male] had thus tricked the [male] monster . he went farther on his journey ; and a few days after he met with king [male] 's only son . who had got his father 's leave to travel into wales . to deliver a beautiful lady from the power of a wicked magician . by whom she was held in enchantment , when [male] found that the young prince had no servants with him .
on the borders of that island he found gotham . where the wise men live ; the same who dragged the pond because the moon had fallen into it . and planted a hedge round the [male] , to keep spring all the year . and he found them bricking up the town gate . because it was so wide that little folks could not get through , and , when he asked why .
fin now gave a skirl that startled the giant . as coming from such a youngster as he was represented to be , `` mother , '' said he , `` i am hungry -- get me something to eat . '' [male] went over , and putting into his hand a cake that had no griddle in it . fin , whose appetite in the meantime was sharpened by what he saw going forward .
she covered him over with cool boughs . with the thick green leaves still fresh upon them . how long he slept he could not tell , but while it was yet dark . a rough voice very near , awoke him , opening his eyes and peering through the mass of foliage . he saw a gigantic indian , surrounded by half a dozen younger men .
formerly exchange of labor was practiced slightly more than at present , but today . as has been noted , all dwellings are built by the unpaid labor of those who come for the accompanying feast and `` good time , '' and because their own dwellings were or will be built by such labor , a great deal of agricultural labor is now paid for in kind . practically all the available labor in an [male] turns out to help a member when a piece of work is urgent . however , it is not customary for poor people to exchange their labor .
but no sooner had the man gained a few steps than the dragon once more came flying after him . then he flung him more loaves and when the loaves came to an end . he turned over his basket so that the eggs rolled over the ground . the dragon had not yet satisfied his hunger and opened his greedy jaws wide . when he suddenly caught sight of the eggs .
on the next divali day the king was returning from a hunt . and he camped under a tree , suddenly he saw all the lamps in his town of [location] come and settle on its branches . one lamp after another told what was happening in its house -- when there had been a dinner party . what there had been to eat , who had been invited , how they themselves had been cared for . and what honours they had received on divali day , after all the other lamps had told their story .
now some of the king 's servants had taken note of the matter . and warned their master not to eat and drink anything that the queen offered him . as for two nights running she had given him a sleeping draught . the queen had no idea that her doings had been discovered . and when , a few days later , she wanted the flax .
for the princess , trying to correct the [female] tendency of the kiss . put out her hands to keep off the page ; so that , along with the kiss . he received , on the other cheek , a slap with the huge black toad . which she poked right into his eye , he tried to laugh . too , but the attempt resulted in such an odd contortion of countenance .
[male] was of course in raptures at the brilliant prospects which were suddenly opening up before him . the day , indeed , was a red letter one -- an omen , he hoped . that fate was preparing to pour down upon him good fortune in the future . in one brief day he had been hailed as the most distinguished scholar in the empire . and he had also been acknowledged as the son in law of the empire 's greatest official .
but demanded an interval of forty days to perform the task . this being agreed to , he took his leave , and having repaired to his lodging . rubbed his ring , commanded the genii to remove the mound . and erect on the space it covered a magnificent palace . and to furnish it suitably for a royal residence , in fifteen days the task was completed .
i pounded with my cane on the ground . but , as i might have known , it was solid rock . it was certainly very strange , i flung myself down behind the trunk of a large hemlock . the two blue lights came hovering directly toward me , i lifted my cane . with a swift blow it cut the air .
the person to whom the african magician addressed himself took a pleasure in showing him the way to [male] 's palace . and he got up and went thither instantly , when he came to the palace . and had examined it on all sides , he doubted not but that [male] had made use of the lamp to build it . without attending to the inability of a poor tailor 's son . he knew that none but the genies .
with what eagerness she danced , leaning on her partner 's shoulder she swept by like a [female] . her cheeks flushed , her eyes sparkled . and it was plain that she loved dancing better than anything else . the poor boy envied those handsome young men with whom she danced so gracefully . but he did not know how little reason he had to be jealous of them .
when the other bannock saw this it determined that it should not have the same fate . so it ran across the kitchen and out of the door as fast as it could . and when the old woman saw it disappearing , she ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her . holding her spindle in one hand and her distaff in the other . but she was old , and the bannock was young , and it ran faster than she did .
so [male] set off to the palace , and when he got there he sent in a message by the beautiful footman who opened the door that [male] . the arithmetical wonder , had come to show the royal family what he could do . it was a dull rainy afternoon . and it so happened that the king , queen , and the two princesses were sitting at home in their state apartments feeling rather bored . the lord chamberlain , who generally amused them on wet days by asking them riddles .
the showiest of all the birds were the burrow ducks , they were undoubtedly related to the ordinary ducks . for , like these , they too had a thick set body , broad [person] . and webbed feet ; but they were much more elaborately gotten up , the feather dress . itself , was white ; around their necks they wore a broad gold band . the wing mirror shone in green , red , and black ; and the wing edges were black .
now there was once a pretty nymph , who lived in the red lake . to which a young and handsome farmer used to come to catch fish , one misty day . when the lad could see only a few feet before him . a wind cleared the air and blew away the fog . then he saw near him a little old man .
now , it would have been all up with him if the [male] relative hadn t flown up in the very [male] of time and tickled the cat 's nose . very well , that made the cat sneeze so violently that she let go of the bluebottle 's leg . and so he flew away , but his leg was broken ; and the doctor came every day for a week . and then he sent in his [female] , and the [female] friend brought all her savings rolled up in an old stocking of her mother 's .
this was [female] 's last novel to be completed , he was in the middle of writing the landleaguers when he had a stroke and died . an old man 's love was published posthumously in 1884 , the sense of urgency that ordinarily attends the last few pages of a novel is absent as one approaches the end . but not the conclusion -- of the landleaguers , knowing that the story is to be terminated at the place where [male] had the stroke that ended his writing career and . a month later , his life , the reader . instead of racing to the conclusion , tends to linger , watching for any clue as to the impending blow .
now to go on and finish my story , it was ten years more before the fairies revisited their godchildren in the lower world . and this time they were to decide who had given the best fairy gift . and i dare say you expect me to give you as long an account of their visits to the young ladies of twenty . as i did of their peeps at the little girls of ten . but i really do not think it worth while , i would do so indeed in a minute if there were anything quite fresh and new to describe .
said the cat , quite plain and distinctly , for when one is a child . and can not yet speak , one understands the hens and ducks , the cats and dogs remarkably well . they speak for [location] as intelligibly as father or mother . one needs but to be little , and then even grandfather 's stick can neigh . and become a horse , with head , legs and tail .
the young nobleman performed his part so well that the prince became deeply attached to him . and submitted in every way to his counsels , but at last a day came when . being in a rage , the advice of his friend irritated him . and he cried hastily , will you drive me mad with your long sermons ? i wish you would hold your tongue for ever .
as soon as [male] had thus tricked the [male] monster . he went farther on his journey ; and a few days after he met with king [male] 's only son . who had got his father 's leave to travel into wales . to deliver a beautiful lady from the power of a wicked magician . by whom she was held in enchantment , when [male] found that the young prince had no servants with him .
the night was clear and the moon shone like a fish 's eye . on reaching a cross road [male] raised his eyes by chance . and stopped , mute and motionless , a flock of ravens were croaking over his head . and in front of him rose four posts . standing like pillars , and connected at the top by cross beams , from each of which swung a half devoured corpse .
ah , how glad he was to see them again with the magic stone in their possession . in a moment he had wished for a palace . but this time it was of green marble . and then he wished for the princess and her ladies to occupy it . and there they lived for many years , and when the old king died the princess 's husband reigned in his stead .
`` i do not care so very much about him , '' said [male] [female] . but she did not despise the grandest man of all the country . who sat by the king 's side , silver plate . and fine linen and woollen , went off to copenhagen in a ship . while the bride made the journey by land in ten days .
have you heard the story about the old street lamp ? it is not so very amusing , but one may very well hear it once . it was such a decent old street lamp , that had done its duty for many . many years , but now it was to be condemned , it was the last evening . it sat there on the post and lighted the street .
yet all of them stood , and tried to keep at a little distance from [female] ! they knew her voice . and were very glad to have her come with her crook to find them . but they felt so strangely because they had not a single tail behind them . the innocent faced old mother sheep , who bleated and stamped to greet [female] , with their tails shorn close .
his fellow traveller stood by with folded hands . gazing on the dark wood and the towns bathed in the warm [male] . at this moment there sounded over their heads sweet music . they looked up , and discovered a large white swan hovering in the air . and singing as never bird sang before , but the song soon became weaker and weaker .
siegfried took the tarnkappe with him that he had wrested from [male] the dwarf . and these high and noble knights made ready for the journey , when stark [male] did on the tarnkappe . he was strong with the strength of twelve men . and with these cunning devices he won the royal [male] . for the cloak of cloud was fashioned on such wise .
a runaway marriage is still simpler , the boy has proposed to the girl through her friend . and she has consented ; and they simply run off into the [female] together . and remain in the [male] , or the gardens , or a distant village . until the boy 's friends have succeeded in propitiating the girl 's father . and the price has been paid ; and then the couple return to the village .
and one of them ran and fetched the golden crown ; and they put it on [male] 's head and hailed him as king . and [male] , who had made up his mind not to be surprised at anything . sat very still and took it all as a matter of course . `` he does not look much like a king , '' whispered a few idle fellows . but they were soon driven out of the hall and made to understand that it was wrong even to think such words .
the hottest hours of the day had already arrived , when they awoke again . and they unanimously determined to wait for evening in this place , after they had eaten together . they moved more closely to each other , and the young merchant , turning to the oldest . addressed him : [male] baruch yesterday made a pleasant afternoon for us . suppose [male] , that you also tell [location] something .
this given to him , the king 's daughter kneeled . and the angry old man , his eyes blazing like fire . pressed the sharp thorns slowly , down and hard , upon the [female] 's brow . quickly the red blood trickled down over her golden hair and face . then in long , narrow lines of red , the drops fell , until the [female] stains were seen over the back .
she wept and implored him and used all her wiles . but [female] remembering the past was firm . and presently he had the reward that a man always has when he 's firm . for as soon as it was evident that she could no longer befool him . the evil enchantment that bound her broke with a snap and peerless beauty became a human [female] as [female] and sweet and loving as she was beautiful .
polikey was a court man . one of the staff of servants belonging to the court household of a boyarinia . he held a very insignificant position on the estate . and lived in a rather poor , small house with his wife and children . the house was built by the deceased nobleman whose widow he still continued to serve .
mrs. [female] made many portraits of distinguished people . but few , if any , of these can now be seen , although it is said that some of them have been carefully preserved by the families who possess them . to americans mrs. [female] is interesting by reason of her patriotism . which amounted to a passion , she is credited with having been an important source of information to the [location] leaders in the time of the revolution . in this she was [female] and courageous , making no secret of her views .
there was another girl ; her friends noticed that when she came home with them in the evening after planting rice she was very careful not to fall behind or be left alone and they used to laugh at her for being a coward . but one day she was gathering indian corn with a friend and as they talked she said you will all have lovely dancing at the sohrai . ', you ! said her friend : `` wo not you be there ? are you going away ? '' then the girl began to cry and sobbed out that her mother had taught her witchcraft and married her to a bonga . and it was for fear of the bonga that she did not like to be alone in the dark .
' he should certainly be kept indoors for the rest of his natural life , ', they said . `` look at his hunched back , and his crooked legs , '' and they began to titter . but where was she ? he asked the white rose , and it made him no answer . the whole palace seemed asleep , and even where the shutters had not been closed . heavy curtains had been drawn across the windows to keep out the glare .
i give you your choice -- will you come with me . or shall the serpents slay you also ? and as the terrified girl stared at her . unable to utter one word , she seized her by the arm and led her to the place where the raft was hidden among the rushes . when they were both on board she took the oars . and they floated down the stream till they had reached the neighbouring country .
instead she rode proudly on the seat of her husband 's ox cart when he delivered wood in the village . sometimes she even drank tea with the mayor 's wife ! visitors from far and near went to see the famous spot where [male] 's vegetables all ran away one halloween night . and to this day there lives not a man who can make grow on that land cabbages or turnips or any other vegetable . although in a spot in the forest , not far off , cabbages and pumpkins and all such vegetables grow wild .
though the cat 's master did not think much of what he said . he had seen him play such cunning tricks to catch rats and mice . hanging himself by the heels , or hiding himself in the meal . to make believe he was dead -- that he did not altogether despair of his helping him in his [male] . when the cat had what he asked for , he booted himself very gallantly .
' at last they stopped at a square white house , there were no windows to it . only a little door like the door of a tomb . they set down the palanquin and knocked three times with a copper hammer . an armenian in a caftan of green leather peered through the wicket . and when he saw them he opened .
and [female] performed great miracles in his temple . all prayers made in it were granted , and from far away people streamed to it to burn incense in his honor . thus half a year passed , then [male] dsing . on the occasion of a great military drill , once came by the cliff in question . and saw the people crowding thickly about the hill like a swarm of ants .
the young couple governed in the forest , and had a numerous progeny . but they were never boiled , and never came on the silver dishes . so from this they concluded that the manor house had fallen to ruins . and that all the men in the world were extinct ; and as no one contradicted them . so , of course it was so , and the rain beat on the dock leaves to make drum music for their sake .
few of [female] 's young lovers are very complex ; the supporting characters are often the ones with interesting quirks and turns . the young may be true or false , or they may be first one and then the other ( as [male] . heir to the rapidly disappearing [male] estate . shows himself to be ) ; and one often views such turns with the detachment of olympian gods . what fools these mortals be , but dr. [male] , [male] , lady [male] .
[female] wished to accompany them , but his friend advised him to return to his own home . [male] mentioned the difficulties in the way . but the youth replied : `` that need not worry you , because i will accompany you . '' after a time the father came , together with [male] . and made [male] a present of a hundred ounces of gold .
blue damsel flies flew from one tuft of rushes to another and chased each other playfully . beware , you giddy ones . who will not know how to avoid the web by passing over and under it , ah ! it has happened ; so much the worse for the victim . when one plays foolishly with one 's companions , one must at least look where one is going .
the king , who was the wisest man in the kingdom . knew well there was a time when things must be done , and questions left till afterward . he had faith in [male] , and rose instantly , with [male] in his arms . `` every man and woman follow me , '' he said , and strode out into the darkness , before he had reached the gate .
in old tales they tell [location] many wonders of heroes and of high courage . of glad feasting , of wine and of mourning . and herein ye shall read of the [female] deeds and of the strife of brave men . there grew up in burgundy a noble [female] , in no land was a [female] .

but he paid them no heed . for he had become full of a very strange desire for the shuttlecock he had lost . he scaled the [male] fence and dropped into the garden which was upon the farther side . now he had marked the very spot where the shuttlecock should have fallen . but it was not there ; so he searched along the foot of the [male] fence .
she watched the preparations made for her departure with indifference . although her pretty frocks were taken down from their hooks in the closets . and her gay ribbons from their boxes , and a trunk of cedar wood with silver bands was brought into the little pretty room . or boudoir , as it was called , which joined the bedrooms , almost any child would have been pleased to watch this getting ready to go away . and would have entered into the details with interest , many a one would have busied herself with packing her little treasures .
so [female] stooped down and stroked the little dog , who looked at her with [female] eyes . and took her farewell of the king ; and the king raised his hand . and the mist rose again and enwrapped the fairy ring and those in it . and [male] walked out through the archway into the cave . and there sat the student on the rock barrier .
so [female] grew up , each passing year of forest life beside the murmuring mere enriched tenfold the natural dower of [female] that shone from the pure spirit in her face . i can not tell why each revolving season enhanced her beauty thus . some say the reason was in the stars ; i think those luminaries had less to do with it than had the fairies ! the more they found of [female] in her . the more their silent influence added to her store ; for they were always with her .
and now the night , i know not whether startled or in joy . whether ashamed of her dark garb , or unconscious of it in the proud sureness of her beauty . dropped loose a portion of the shadows of her robe . and stood forth radiant , clad with the dazzling beauty of her stars . then she raised her hand and laid it on her heart .
the first that presented himself was an astrologer and magician . whom the king caused to be conducted to the princess 's prison . the astrologer drew forth out of a bag he carried under his arm an astrolabe . a small sphere , a chafing dish , several sorts of drugs for fumigations . a brass pot , with many other things .
it has its lair in the burning mountain . and the fire spirits guard it night and day . it is a hundred days journey from this place . and because of the jealousy of the fire spirits no man dare go near it . but i , because all beasts are known to fear it much , may approach it without hurt .
avrillia , ah , now [female] remembered ! she had meant to go straight to find [female] and [female] ! she glanced around to see if she could find the curly little path . but she could not really start until she had asked a few questions about the darling little snoodle . `` is -- is not he lovely ? '' she began , aware of a vague necessity of pleasing the wife of the snimmy .
straightway the boat rose in the air , and in a flash . just like an arrow sent from a bow , it brought them to a great stony mountain . at that mountain stood a house , and in the house lived the little man . himself one finger tall . his mustache seven versts in length .
away and into the night they rode , the stag had mighty antlers with many points . and at the end of each point there burned a little star . the stag gave light on the way , and at his heels sped the twelve squirrels . each squirrel with eyes that shone like two diamonds . they sped and they fled , and far behind them toiled the daughter in law and her husband .
now people wore shoes and the floor . instead of being muddy , or dusty , with pools and puddles of water in the time of rainy weather and with the pigs and chickens running in and out . was of clay , beaten down flat and hard , and neatly whitewashed at the edges . outside , in front , were laid nice flat flagstones , that made a pleasant path to the front door . flowers , inside and out , added to the beauty of the home and made perfume for those who loved them .
and the little toad went and brought out a great chest , then they gave her food and drink . and led her to a beautifully made bed of silk and samite . on which she lay down and slept soundly , when the day dawned she arose . and the old toad gave her three things out of the huge chest to take with her . she would have need of them .
it is these little green cells that by the help of the sun waves digest the food of the plant and turn the water and gases into useful sap and juices . we saw in lecture iii . that when we breathe in air , we use up the oxygen in it and send back out of our mouths carbonic acid . which is a gas made of oxygen and carbon . now , every living things wants carbon to feed upon .
he could not brandish the sword ; so the princess said that he was to take a draught from the flask which hung by its side . and when he had done that he could wield the sword . soon afterwards the [male] came , and he was so large and stout that he was forced to go sideways to get through the door . when the [male] got his first head in he cried , hutetu ! it smells of a [male] man 's blood here !
he found the door of the brugh open . put steel in one of the posts , entered , having the cock in his arms . and hid himself in a corner . towards morning the cock crew . the head or principal fairy caused a search to be made .
i looked perplexedly after her , then i peered round the fence post and saw my mother standing under a tree . waiting for me , she beckoned , i took one more look inside the fence . and i saw the little girl sit down beside the sleeping man and fold her hands . the afternoon sun smote across the long wood yard . with its mysterious rooms made by the piling of the cords .
louis ix , was born in 1215 ; add the four ciphers of this date . and you have ix , [female] , was born in 1402 ; the sum of one plus four plus two gives vii , [female] . was born in 1461 ; and one plus four plus six plus one equal xii , [male] iv . died in 1610 ; and one plus six plus one equal twice iv , [male] . was crowned in 1643 . and these four ciphers give [organization] , the same king died in 1715 .
among other things , this [female] child had to go twice a day to draw water more than a mile and a half from the house . and bring home a pitcherful of it . one day , as she was at this fountain . there came to her a poor woman , who begged of her to let her drink . `` oh , yes , with all my heart , [female] , '' said this pretty little girl .
they were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground . `` what are you doing there ? '' asked the father , `` i am making a little trough , '' answered the child , `` for father and mother to eat out of when i am big . '' the man and his wife looked at each other for a while . and presently began to cry , then they took the old grandfather to the table .
so [female] slowly drew her up , and when she was near the top he let go the rope . and she fell down and broke her neck , then [male] heaved a great sigh and said . that was hard work ; the rope has hurt my hands badly . but now i am rid of her for ever , so [male] came down from the tower . and went on , till he got to a desert place .
[male] 's reputation for goodness and for love to his fellow men had reached his ears . and he was anxious that their families should be united by the marriage of two young people . the rich merchant , whose heart always retained its child-like spirit . was delighted with this proposal , which had come to him spontaneously , and not through the intrigues of a middle woman . he was also touched by the apparently generous spirit of the writer .
the princess took leave of her father . and took some money with her , but not much , and went again into the great wood . there she looked everywhere for the iron stove . but it was not to be found , she sought it for nine days . until her hunger was so great that she did not know what to do ; for she had eaten all the food she could find .
in the man of lawes tale the word elfe is employed . but whether as equivalent to witch or fairy is doubtful , it thus appears that the works of manners painting [male] give very little information respecting the popular belief in fairies of his day . were it not for the sly satire of the passage . we might be apt to suspect that , like one who lived away from the common people . he was willing to represent the superstition as extinct --
just then a man came along with a basket of crabs . heard her lamentations , and stopped to inquire what ailed her . she told him , and he said he knew no help for her . but he would do the best he could for her by giving her half his crabs . the old woman put the crabs in her water jar .
eager to carry out his plan , [male] tied a long string to his gayest poster . and then fastening it to the pole with which he sometimes fished in the water cask . held it up to catch the fresh breezes blowing down the court . his good friend , the wind , soon caught the idea . and with a strong breath sent the red paper whisking over the wall .
in the morning the blessed sun arose in the east . stretching out his rays like hands to warn the king not to go into the forest where robbers lived . the king went on foot with his [female] daughter and his wife . and their feet were wounded by the thorny grass , so they came to a fortified village . it was like the city of death .
so till evening fell , then she stumbled up the dark stairs which led to the high room open to the stars and tried to think it out . someone had hurt her , who was it ? she raised her eyes . there shone : `` its wavering image. '' it helped her to lucidity . he had done it , was it unconsciously dealt—that cruel blow ?
`` children do not go in there , dear , '' said the teacup . as [female] stood gazing at it , fascinated , but indeed she had no wish to go in . and it was with a skip of joy that she heard the first gunkus say . `` time 's up , miss , '' at that word . back they all went scampering through the vale , till they came to a bridge .
`` 'die unbesiegbaren '' is a most powerful work , and stood out in the midst of the sculpture at [location] in 1900 with the prominence imparted by unusual power in the perception of the whole of a subject and the skill to render the perception so that others realize its full meaning . there are four figures in this group -- men drawing a heavy freight boat along the shore by means of a towline passed round their bodies . on which they throw their weight in such a way that their legs . pressed together , lose their outline -- except in the case of the leader . and are as a mass of power , they also pull on the line with their hands .
meantime the elder sister had reached her father 's . and , with much circumstance and a very long face , had told him how that her sister was supporting an idle dog . and entertaining him as her husband , in her anxiety to make known her sister 's affairs and the great scandal she was bringing upon the family . the eldest forgot to say any thing of the sticks and stones which her own husband brought home for bears and beavers . the old man suspecting that there was magic about her house , sent a deputation of young men and women to ask his youngest daughter to come to him .
i am glad to assure you that these vile creatures have long since perished and passed from earth . but in the days when [male] was making his first toys they were a numerous and powerful tribe . one of the principal sports of the awgwas was to inspire angry passions in the hearts of little children . so that they quarreled and fought with one another , they would tempt boys to eat of unripe fruit . and then delight in the pain they suffered .
once upon a time there lived in the south country two brothers . whose business it was to keep sheep . no one lived on that plain but shepherds , who watched their sheep so carefully that no lamb was ever lost . for some time the brothers lived peaceably in their father 's cottage . and kept their flock on the grassy plain .
`` the poor man has escaped once before , '' said mr. mac morlan , drily . but something worse was in store for [male] than the cold shoulder from his fellow justices . in his search through the documents found upon [male] . [male] had come upon three slips of paper . being bills which had been drawn and signed by [male] on the very day of the [male] murder . ordering large sums of money to be paid to [male] .
the dog licked the prince 's hand . and then trotted so resolutely down a certain road that the two friends allowed him to lead them and followed close behind . they travelled in this way to the edge of the king 's dominions . only halting for needful rest and refreshment , at last the dog led them through a wood . and towards evening they found themselves in the depths of the forest .
this he would naturally attribute to the quality of his fare . and would change his diet a dozen times a day . his menu in the twelve working hours comprising an astonishing range of articles . from a wood saw to a kettle of soft soap -- edibles as widely dissimilar as the zenith and the nadir . which , also , he would eat , so catholic an appetite was , of course .
they ran swiftly from tree to tree , and now and then one would stop at a tree and wait . often the king of [male] 's son came close to a waiting shadow . one became like a small old man with a beard , the king 's son saw this shadow again and again . what were they , the shadows , he asked himself ? maybe they were wise creatures and could tell him what he wanted to know .
they saw no hope of making a lasting settlement there . and , moreover , [female] who was very grasping , tried to deceive the other settlers and get more than her share of everything . so that [male] himself lost [male] with her and threatened her . it happened that one of the men of the party . [male] , was [male] 's foster brother .
when she came at last , and heard the story and saw the wolf lying there on the floor . she could not thank the woodcutter enough , and indeed , if it had not been for him the little girl would certainly have been eaten by the wolf . but from then on red riding hood was careful to obey her mother , and not to loiter on the way when she was sent on errands . in a far city in [location] there once lived a lad named [male] . [male] 's mother was a widow .
one day it chanced that the emissaries of the [location] raja and those of the chandmuni raja met at a river . both parties were resting after taking their midday meal and as they smoked they fell into conversation . and soon found that their meeting was most fortunate ; each party had found the tery thing they wanted . so they all set off to the palace of the [location] raja in order that the chandmuni raja 's messengers might see the young men . the [location] raja ordered them to be hospitably entertained and food to be set before them .
thread by thread , inch by inch . the grass palace of [female] grew on the loom . the cave of the talking waters , the giant ship with its masts above the clouds . and the fountain of memory in the wood beyond the world . the sun set behind the high towers of the city .
then drew near the festival of bon , the time of returning souls . the good folk of [location] took lanterns and visited their graves . bringing food and flowers , they cared for their beloved dead . on the thirteenth day of the seventh month , which , in the bon . is the day of days , [male] the samurai walked in his garden by night for the sake of the coolness .
but in truth when she awoke in the morning . and heard still the rattling of the windows . and saw the clouds , as if dissolved in mist and steam . still hiding the face of the heavens , she could have wept for anxiety and sadness . especially when she heard from her maidens that [female] had already left their apartment clad in full armour as if prepared for a combat .
in [person] 's travels the men horses or houyhnhnms are fine horses gifted with human intelligence . but the yahoos are described by swift as having a very peculiar shape . their heads and breasts were covered with a thick hair . some frizzled and others lank , they had beards like goats and a long ridge of hair down their backs .
the hall was crowded with occupants , but they were seals . not men , and when the seal catcher turned to his companion to ask him what it all meant . he was aghast to find that he , too , had assumed the form of a seal . he was still more aghast when he caught sight of himself in a large mirror that hung on the wall . and saw that he also no longer bore the likeness of a man .
and they were right , a few days after this the king 's son sent a herald who announced . by sound of a trumpet , that the prince would marry any lady whom the glass slipper fitted . then commenced a great trying on by princesses and duchesses and all the ladies of the court . but it was of no use , at last they brought the glass slipper to the two sisters . who did their best to get their feet into it , but they could not do so .
the robbers stayed some time within the rock . and [female] , who feared that some one , or all of them together , might come out and catch him . if he should endeavour to make his escape , was obliged to sit patiently in the tree . he was nevertheless tempted to get down , mount one of their horses , and lead another . driving his asses before him with all the haste he could to town .
a strange horse , which can not be driven away , is seen all winter among the rest of the farm horses . in olden times horses were little housed during winter . the stable door was left open , and the horses , after eating the little straw allowed them . went out to pick up what they could , when spring work comes on the strange horse is caught like the rest and made to work . perhaps for greater security the cow shackle is put round its neck .
we give here for purposes of enjoyment and comparison a prose story and a poem . both of which tell the story of the greek [male] who was carried off to the dark underworld . but who , unlike [male] , became the bride of its king . also another story of dwarfs and their ways . presently the girls who had been playing with [female] came up to the place where the beautiful [female] was growing .
he stricken in body , she in soul . together they fell down to the margin of the pool . the falcon still clung fleshing its beak in the neck of its prey . the heron princess threw back her head , and , darting furiously , struck her own sharp [female] deep into the falcon 's breast . the bird threw out its wings with a hoarse cry and fell back dead .
and as the frog foretold , so it happened . and the queen bore a daughter so beautiful that the king could not contain himself for joy . and he ordained a great feast , not only did he bid to it his relations . friends , and acquaintances , but also the wise women . that they might be kind and favourable to the child .
the world called her the [female] de ', medici . by her side were statues , in which the spirit of life breathed in stone . figures of men , one of whom whetted his sword . and was named the grinder ; wrestling gladiators formed another group . the sword had been sharpened for them , and they strove for the goddess of beauty .
for a moment there was intense silence , then deafening cheers arose . and all faces were radiant with delight , especially the faces of the ladies , who thus remained equals . no jealousy being possible , such tact , said one , how true ! ', cried another . but one lady had slipped away unobserved , it was countess [male] . the gallant monarch , unaccompanied , pleased at the reception given to his declaration .
the mountain districts of south [person] have numbers of them . and they are also found on several hills in sicily , malta has the giant 's tower . in every particular of appearance and construction identical with the tower of [person] in [person] . cyprus has them , and they still remain in candia and on the coast of asia minor . in [location] none have yet been found , or at least have not been recorded by travellers or surveyors .
rabbit began singing the same song , dancing nearer to the field . while all the wolves stamped their feet , he sang the song again . dancing still nearer the edge of the field , the fourth time he sang it . while the wolves were stamping their feet as hard as they could . rabbit made one jump off and leaped through the long grass , the wolves raced after him .
as it finished striking they came out at the farther edge of the great bed of reeds . and there was the castle straight before them , -- a beautiful castle . standing on the slope of a hill , the grass all about it was covered with beautiful flowers . two of the taller turrets were overgrown with ivy . and a flag was flying on a staff ; but everything was so silent and lonely that it made one sad to look on .
a horned owl perched beside him , and on a branch just above him a hen hawk alighted . these would have been dangerous neighbours at any other time , but now they did not even glance in his direction . only stared at the fire , probably they could not make out what was wrong with the forest . a marten ran up the pine to the tip of a branch . and looked at the burning heights , close beside the marten sat a squirrel .

this was saturday evening , and the family had just settled down in the library with the transcript . each with a section , [male] had the news .

they mounted higher and higher in the air , and the ugly little duckling had a strange sensation as he watched them . he whirled himself in the water like a wheel . stretched out his neck towards them . and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened even himself . could he ever forget those beautiful , happy birds , and when at last they were out of his sight .
quite unlike [female] and other ordinary people , instead of having a great dread of death . they all , both rich and poor , longed for it as something good and desirable . they were all tired of their long , long lives , and longed to go to the happy land of contentment called paradise of which the priests had told them centuries ago . all this [male] soon found out by talking to the islanders , he found himself . according to his ideas , in the land of topsy turvydom .
a magic well had sprung up in the plain , and not being properly looked after by the woman in charge of it . its waters burst forth over the plain . drowning [male] and nearly all his family , [female] , although swept away like the others . was not drowned , she lived for a whole year , with her lap dog . in a chamber beneath the lake , and god protected her from the water .
her heart hardened , after all , it was best that the child should be placed where she would be compelled to behave herself . her voice was soft , and her expression was so subdued that the teacher could hardly believe that the moment before she had defiantly stated that she would never be a good girl . she paused irresolutely , should she make one more appeal to the parent to make her a promise which would be a good excuse for restraining the order of the court ? ah , if he only would , and she only could prevent the carrying out of that order ! they found ten suie among his curiosities , smoking a very long pipe with a very small , ivory bowl .
the old woman thanked the steward for his advice . and promised to follow it , she kept her word so well that she only told her story that evening to two neighbors . her dearest friends , both of whom swore on the heads of their little children to keep it secret . the oath was a solemn one , and so well kept that at noon the next day there was not a boy of six in the village that did not point his finger at the old woman . while the very dogs seemed to bark in their language , `` here is the old woman with her guineas !

the princess knew nothing of making fires and cooking . and the beggar was forced to help her , early the next morning he called her to clean the house . thus they lived for three days , and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage . the man said : wife , we can not go on like this . spending money and earning nothing , you must learn to weave baskets .
all this duessa—who called herself fidessa—heard . and knew it for truth , she well nigh fainted for fear . but the time for the discovering of her falseness was not yet . while the red cross knight was thus faring , the lady [female] was not a little troubled that she should have been so left by her champion . never did she cease to search for him , wandering the while over plain .
sometimes it had come to him in the guise of a peddler . and had opened its box and let silver ribbon come fluttering out , with verses and inscriptions of old remembrances . but it was most charming of all when it came as an old grandmother . with silvery hair , and such large , sensible eyes , she knew so well how to tell about the oldest times . long before the princesses spun with the golden spindles , and the dragons lay outside the castles , guarding them .
so she shut the gate again and told the cows to go on—for they understood her quite well—and then she went on after them . when they got to the dairy she milked them one after the other as they came in their regular order to the stool . she was milking the last one—cherry , the best of them all—and she leaned her face against its side . and listened to the `` [location] , [location] , '' of the milk as it streamed into the pail with a foam like the sea in a rage . she was in fact almost lulled to sleep by it .
then she set to work to make the winter clothes for the three of them . she set up her simple wooden spinning wheel and spun the thread before she began to weave the stuffs . in the intervals of her work she directed the little girl 's games and taught her to read the old stories of her country . thus did the wife find consolation in work during the lonely days of her husband 's absence . while the time was thus slipping quickly by in the quiet home , the husband finished his business and returned .
`` willingly , '' answered the weaver , so the next morning the seven weavers set out to go to the village where they could buy what they wanted . on the way they had to cross a ravine which lately had been full of water . but now was quite dry , the weavers , however , were accustomed to swim over this ravine . therefore , regardless of the fact that this time it was dry . they stripped , and , tying their clothes on their heads .

in his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess . but as everybody said she was bewitched , he never dreamed that she could bewitch him . for what indeed could a prince do with a princess that had lost her gravity ? who could tell what she might not lose next ? she might lose her visibility . or her tangibility ; or , in short , the power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium .

not unlike water , which after long journeying , has been compressed into blocks of green glass . the glaciers lie here , so that one huge mass of ice is heaped on the other . the rushing stream roars below and melts snow and ice . within , hollow caverns and mighty clefts open , this is a wonderful palace of ice . and in it dwells the ice maiden , the queen of the glaciers .

when i awoke , i found myself being carried through a dimly lighted tunnel on the wings of the wind . i say on the wings of the wind for i was not conscious that any palpable substance touched my body . the further we receded from the earth , the wider and loftier became the subterranean passage . and by means of the dim light . i discerned rocks of gold and precious stones .
on and on the exiles walked , till they arrived at a certain village . where they determined to spend the night under one of the big trees of the place . the prince made preparations for a fire . and arranged the few articles of bedding that they had with them . while the vizier 's son went to the baniya and the baker and the butcher to get something for their dinner .
i was there too , and ate and drank many good things , i sha ', n t forget that feast as long as i live , once upon a time the king of the goldland lost himself in a forest . and try as he would he could not find the way out . as he was wandering down one path which had looked at first more hopeful than the rest he saw a man coming towards him . then promise me that you will give me the first thing that comes out of your house .

the president of the council looked up to see what was the matter . but was immediately struck on the nose by a pellet of closely squeezed paper . which was immediately followed by another , and another , as the blowing at the keyhole was repeated . at length , when another blast had produced a shrill whistle . which showed that the aperture was clear , a little object , about the size of a hornet .
jurgen and his foster parents went past this castle . they had told him its story during the long winter evenings . and now he saw the stately edifice , with its double moat . and trees and bushes ; the wall . covered with ferns , rose within the moat , but the lofty lime trees were the most beautiful of all .

' now let [location] finish our dessert —for the ambassadors had come in right in the middle of it . `` you are quite right there '' ; and he seemed quite happy again , soon after it became evening . and lord [male] had to go out to look after his army . and the prince too went to see that his men were all prepared for any night attack—for his men were right in the very front of all . and so they were quite close to the enemy , who might at any time begin an attack .
the wild geese travelled forward over the long , narrow city , and behaved themselves here just as they had done in the country . but in the city there was no one who answered them . it was not to be expected that city folks should stop out in the streets . and call to the wild geese , the trip extended further along vettern 's shores . and after a little they came to sanna sanitarium , some of the patients had gone out on the veranda to enjoy the spring air .
away flew the grey dove swifter than an arrow from the string . nor did the soldiers darts overtake her , off she flew and brought back [female] from the bog . but [female] had turned herself into a [female] and perched upon the gable of the soot blacked house . when i perish in the midst of the emperor 's host . go , my lovely little bride , submit yourself to the princess .

the monster , wakened from her sleep , curled her tail about her head . and rushed to the cavern 's mouth , but , seeing one armed from top to toe in shining mail . would have turned again , but the knight leaped at her , fierce as a lion leaps upon his prey . and barred her backward way with his sword , first she darted at him her great tail . and threatened him with the deadly sting that lay in it .
the circumstances of the italian noble caused him to be very amenable to art influence . living chiefly out of doors . his climate rendered him less dependent on the comforts of small rooms . to which more northern people were attached , and his ideas would naturally aspire to pomp and elegance . rather than to home life and utility , instead of the warm chimney corner and the comfortable seat .
through the wide-open portals the desolate land could be seen . stretching as far as the eye could reach , covered with the same dusty blue flower . and quite on the horizon it mixed with the sky . so that it was difficult to discern where the one began and the other ended . a peculiar stillness lay over everything ; it was not easy to imagine that human feet had once crowded towards the now broken altar that shone like a death cloth as the rays of the sun struck upon the still white stone .
they may meet him on the physical plane . marry him and keep house with him and the children will be human beings and not undines . because they receive a human soul from the man . if an [male] becomes united to man she will thereby receive the germ of immortality . as an [female] without her union with man dies like an animal .
to begin the battle he poised a great stone in his left hand and cast it full against the sturdy form of the master woodsman . who turned it aside with his ax , then rushed the three eyed giants of tatary upon the knooks . and the goozzle goblins upon the ryls , and the firebreathing dragons upon the sweet fairies . because the nymphs were ak 's own people the band of awgwas sought them out . thinking to overcome them with ease , but it is the law that while evil .

[female] . for , as he walked along in the silence of the sea twilight , on the soft white ocean floor .
the fish darted toward the old shoe and swallowed it . making of it a mere mouthful , the boy man laughed in himself . but said nothing , till the fish was fairly caught , when he took hold of the line and began to pull himself in his fish carriage ashore . the sister , who was watching all this time , opened wide her eyes as the huge fish came up and up upon the shore . and she opened them still more when the fish seemed to speak .

but the king , embracing him with great affection . bade him put on his cap and sit beside him . and how the queen was enraged at this , heaven knows . for by the bow of many colours that appeared in her face might be known the wind of the storm that was brewing in her heart against poor [female] . not far from this castle lived a most ferocious dragon , who was born the same hour with the queen .
that the princess was willing enough to do , for she was both tired and hungry . so into the house she went to serve mother [female] for a year and a day . but it was no common work that the princess did . i can tell you ; for listen : when she blew the bellows that the fire might blaze the brighter . the wind swept over the great brown world so that every windmill turned around and around from [female] pfennigdrummel 's to the shores of the great black sea at the north end of the earth .
while , on reaching the end of her walk , she was chalking her soles again . the applause which had accompanied her during her dangerous pilgrimage still rose to her ears . and came most loudly of all from the stand where [male] sat among the distinguished spectators . he , too , had clapped his hands lustily , and shouted , `` bravo ! '' never had he beheld any ropedancer display so much [male] .
suddenly the bird sang , [male] . again there filled his heart that same mysterious desire to follow wherever the bird might lead him . nothing else in the world seemed to him to matter half so much . the bird flew on , now they were in a region of white [male] trees and low growing bushes . and the ground all about was covered with a carpet of tiny purple flowers with bright yellow centres . foot of the tree and fastened the head of his axe in the hole .
then they sat down in different corners of the nursery and cried . and called each other names , and said they wished they were dead . this is very naughty indeed , as , of course , you know ; but you must remember how hot it was . `` what would make you happy ? '' said a thick , wheezy voice from the toy cupboard . and out rolled the big green and red india rubber ball that aunt [female] had sent them last week .
so he rode on with the beautiful [male] , and his path led him once more through the village in which his two brothers had stopped . here there was great tumult and lamentation , and when he asked what it all meant . he was told that two men were going to be hanged , when he came nearer . he saw that they were his two brothers . who had committed every kind of wicked folly and had squandered all their money .
she found the [location] [female] sitting upon a big stone . barefooted and miserably dressed in an old , coarse , linen gown and cap ; the ground at her feet was all strewn with robes of gold and silver . ribbons and laces , diamonds and pearls . over which the turkeys were stalking to and fro , while the king 's ugly . disagreeable son stood opposite her , declaring angrily that if she would not marry him she should be killed .
the sementera is about 20 by 50 feet , or about 1,000 square feet . and lies in the midst of the large valley area between [female] and [female] . it is on the [female] side of the river . but is the property of a [female] family . there are two groups of soil turners in the sementera .
then he dismissed them , and they were all very well pleased with the new king . for they saw that , in spite of his odd ways . he had a kind heart . and would try to make everyone about him as merry as he was himself . the first case of dispute was between two men who each claimed to own a fine cow .
he lives at a new place , then the old place where he lived dries up . but a fresh spring of water gushes from his new lodge . the water of this spring is warm in winter . but in summer it is as cold as ice . before one dares drink of it , he prays to the water .
he rested heavily on the gate , and the first thing he saw was [male] on the steps . laughing and playing with a litter of young puppies , and the next was [male] climbing the castle wall to get an arrow that had lodged in a high chink . and out of a window leaned [male] in all his young beauty . picking sweet clusters of the seven sisters roses that climbed to his room . and in the doorway sat [male] , with a book on his knee .
miss [female] was only twenty two , and wore rose color , but the design of her dress was her mother 's own . [female] wore an eighties collar with old oak plaid and a red tie . i did not like his taste , after supper we had music . and [male] kept on singing , at vine 's particular request . i did not take much notice of what he was singing till vine came and spoke to me .
the traveler thanked the hermit and took his way to the mountain . when he reached the abode of destiny he saw a magnificent palace full of servants constantly bustling about and doing nothing . as to destiny , he was supping at a table bountifully served , when the stranger saw this he also sat down at the table and supped with the master of the house . after supper destiny went to bed . and his guest did the same , at daybreak this house had also disappeared .
the serpent had done all that he could to help the owl . and now he was angry , he was afraid , too , for he did not know what would happen to him . and he lay on the ground [male] and quivering . it was not long before his old skin fell off , and then he saw that under it was a beautiful new one . all bright and shining , he sheds his old skin every year now .
a fakir in his highness 's train had stolen these treasures . and carried them to the princess , take the greatest care of these two things , ', said he . `` your fate depends upon them , '' then he went away . and was seen no more , the prince of cashmere , in great despair at his loss . determined to travel to the fair at cabul , to see whether among all the merchants who collected there from the four quarters of the earth .
it was not only to giants and men that [male] showed himself in the days when he went through [location] and midgard as [male] the wanderer . he met and he spoke with the gods also . with one who lived far away from [male] and with others who came to midgard and to [location] . the one who lived far away from [male] was [male] . [male] 's silent son , far within a wilderness .
her foster parents , the duke and duchess . had come to fetch her away , but [female] entreated them to remain with her until certain intelligence had been obtained of [female] 's fate . she endeavored to prevail upon several young knights , who were eagerly courting her . to follow the noble adventurer to the forest , but she would not pledge her hand as a reward of the enterprise . because she always cherished the hope of belonging to the returning knight .
while she spoke , she saw through the blank darkness a glimmer of light . it came through a little door , she remembered what [female] had said . that she would never return to the fairy palace . until after she was buried , perhaps this final cruelty of [female] would be the end of her sorrows . so she took courage , crept through the little door , and lo !
when [male] had spoken with him he found that the face of [male] did not belie the heart within him . and gladly the god felt that at last he had found the perfect companion . the ever courageous and joyous young mate , whose mood was always ready to meet his own . did [male] desire to hunt , with merry shout [male] called the hounds . did the great god deign to fish , [male] was ready to fetch the nets and to throw himself .
once only they saw him , -- [male] , the flower . and the others , it was one day when [male] had called louder than usual . they saw a little figure in a night dress come to an upper window and lean his arms out . they saw it was the little boy . and , oh , how pale and ill he looked , but his yellow hair was as glorious as ever .
the princess desiring that her husband should owe the discovery of her to herself alone . resolved to put an end to her own torments and his ; for she had observed . that as often as she discoursed with him about the affairs of office . he heaved such deep sighs , as could be addressed to nobody but her . while she herself lived in such a constraint .
once there lived a king who had no children for many years after his marriage . at length heaven granted him a daughter of such remarkable beauty that he could think of no name so appropriate for her as `` fairer than a fairy . '' it never occurred to the good natured monarch that such a name was certain to call down the hatred and jealousy of the fairies in a body on the child . but this was what happened , no sooner had they heard of this presumptuous name than they resolved to gain possession of her who bore it . and either to torment her cruelly , or at least to conceal her from the eyes of all men .
`` enough , enough , '' gasped the lad ; but the demon heeded him not . the lad did not know the words by which to send him away . and still he fetched water , it rose to the boy 's knees and still more water was poured . it mounted to his waist , and [male] still kept on bringing barrels full . it rose to his armpits , and he scrambled to the table top .
these he set at the window through which the knight was used to enter . next day he feigns to go to the chase . the old woman returns to her bed to sleep , and the lady anxiously expects `` him whom she loveth loyally , '' and says that he may come safelý , and with her at all leisure be . exhausted with loss of blood , he can stay no longer , he departs .
at about two miles from our cottage , where the earth on the hill is sheltered by a few scattered trees . stood the little church , with a silver lamp hanging before the altar . i put on my best clothes , and the white tunic fell in graceful folds over my hips . the red jacket fitted tight and close , the [male] on my fez cap was of silver . and in my girdle glittered a knife and my pistols .
god knows best , and he makes some merchants and some foresters . and some good and some bad , all in his own way , anyhow this one was a merchant . and he had three daughters , they were none of them so bad to look at . but one of them was as pretty as [female] , and she was the best of them too . the others put all the hard work on her .
i was the chief of the race . he had stricken my father dead -- but i gathered my fellows together . i swore i would strike off his head , each of them looked like a king . and was noble in birth as in worth , and each of them boasted he sprang from the oldest race upon earth . each was as brave in the fight as the bravest hero of song .
the wind helped her , and as the days passed . the sun and the rain helped her . and she used certain magic which she knew . so that presently her garden was a glory , poppies and corn . beans and berries , green peas and sweet peas .
now all the talk was of the philosopher 's magic stone . and who should find it , and at court every one was discussing how this unexpected turn of events would affect the princess 's marriage . it was to have taken place in a very short time . the king was very angry , he considered that a slight had been cast upon the princess and upon himself by the carelessness of the philosopher . he was not well pleased , either , to know that the great wealth of the man who was to have been his son in law was all due to magic influences .
the prince bowed politely by way of reply . and turned to address the little [male] he had once saved from death by poison . and so in feasting , dancing and laughter the evening passed pleasantly enough to the prince . and it was late when he called [male] to attend him to their apartment . the following morning marvel and [male] once more set out to leave the kingdom of [male] and its ugly king .
we continued our journey for ten days thereafter . and found we had fortunately attained a distance inland where ocean tides no longer affected the water . which had become fresh , the discovery came none too soon , for our remaining cask of water was well nigh exhausted . we lost no time in replenishing our casks . and continued to sail farther up the river when the wind was favorable , along the banks great forests miles in extent could be seen stretching away on the shore line .
he had just finished , when , taking one step farther , he tumbled headlong into the pit . and [male] struck him a blow on the head with his pickax that killed him . [male] then returned home to cheer his friends with the news . another giant , called [male] , vowed to be revenged on [male] if ever he should have him in his power . this giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely wood .
now there were thirteen fairies in his kingdom , and he had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat out of . so that he was obliged to leave one of the fairies without an invitation . the rest came , and after the feast was over they gave all their best gifts to the little princess . one gave her virtue , another beauty . another riches , and so on till she had all that was excellent in the world .
`` now indeed i know that you love me when you tell me this , '' said his wife , and then she went to sleep , for she was satisfied . [male] waited until near morning , and then he arose and dressed himself . he put on the coat of one brother . and the breeches of another , and the shoes of a third , and so on .
when she was thirty five her father died , now she was free to go where she pleased . but she did not go anywhere , and so , when her father left her free to go . [female] lived on still in the mill of dreams . and kept her millstones grinding , two years went by , and her hard gray lonely life laid its hand on her hair and her countenance . her father had worn her out before her time .
now , it happened one morning -- the bright star tells nothing about this . but we know it occurred -- that a noble roman company came into the narrow lane . the carriage stopped at the top of the lane . and the company proceeded on foot towards the house . to inspect the young sculptor 's work , for they had heard him spoken of by chance .
' to your very good health , cried the shepherd before anyone else . and the king was so delighted that he did not regret having given him his daughter . in time , when the old king died , the shepherd succeeded him . he made a very good king and never expected his people to wish him well against their wills . but , all the same , everyone did wish him well , for they all loved him .
the girl got out , and walked slowly and sadly to meet her terrible fate . the coachman perceived that the shepherd wished to follow her . and warned him not to do so if he valued his life . but the shepherd would not listen to his advice , when they had climbed about half-way up the hill they saw a terrible looking monster with the body of a snake . and with huge wings and claws , coming towards them .
it happened once that the father was going to the fair . and asked his wife 's daughters what he should bring them . `` fine clothes , '' said the first : `` pearls and diamonds , '' said the second , `` now , child , '' said he to his own daughter . what will you have ? the first sprig , dear father , that rubs against your hat on your way home , ', said she .
then began a distressful period for the hapless youngster . first of all , a throat specialist operated on him for the removal of the adenoids and the hyper trophied tonsils . after this he was sent to the eye clinic . where he was fitted with glasses , next , he was taken to the dental clinic . where his teeth were cleaned and filled , all the while a trained social worker kept in touch with his parents to make sure that he would receive the hygienic care which had hitherto been wanting .
we must now return to [male] 's ship . which , after he had thrown prince [male] overboard . was soon surrounded on all sides by queen [female] 's squadron . the ship in which queen [male] was in person first came up with him . and [male] , being in no condition of defence against so many .
long , long ago , in the days when even stranger things befell than we see nowadays . travelers brought news to the little town of kisington by the sea . they said that the terrible dragon of [male] had wakened again from his fifty years ', nap . had crept out of his cave in the mountain , and was terrifying the country as he had done in the grandfathers ', times . already he had destroyed ten horses ; had eaten one hundred head of cattle .
one of the women went out , and returned soon again with a [location] dish in her hand . full of a certain liquor , which she presented to the magician . while the other helped her to sit up , `` drink this liquor , '' said she . it is the water of the fountain of lions . and a sovereign remedy against all fevers whatsoever , you will find the effect of it in less than an hour 's time .
she looked the very picture of grief . then the king opened the door of a little chamber in which she was to sleep . it was adorned with rich green tapestry , and resembled the cave in which he had found her . on the floor lay the bundle of flax which she had spun from the nettles . and under the ceiling hung the coat she had made .
`` she can not be sleeping through this , '' said [male] to himself . and with an uneasy heart he stood beside the door and looked into the lodge . and she was not there , and the couch had not been slept on , but on it lay her empty dress . its gold and black all tumbled in a heap , and on top of it was an embroidered smock . and something in the smock attracted him .
but it was no use talking , pay for it he must and should . there was a meal sack handy , and into it [male] and dudden popped [male] o'neary . tied him up tight , ran a pole through the knot . and off they started for the brown lake of the bog . each with a pole end on his shoulder , and [male] o'neary between .
in a short time all this picture disappeared , but it caused beauty to think that the beast . besides being very powerful , was also very kind , about the middle of the day she found a table laid ready for her . and a sweet concert of music played all the time she was dining . without her seeing anybody , but at supper , when she was going to seat herself at table . she heard the noise of the beast .
so beautiful and melodious were the things she uttered that , by the time she had sung a single sentence . the branches above her head would be filled with the birds that came thither to listen . the thickets around her would be crowded with beasts , and the waters rolling beside her would be alive with fishes . all attracted by the sweet sounds , from the minnow to the porpoise . from the [female] to the eagle , from the snail to the lobster .
yet his eyes were tight shut , and it was clear to all that he was fast asleep . but in his dream he had slashed at so many of the skins that the whole room was full of wine . when the innkeeper perceived this , the loss of his wine so enraged him that he in his turn flew at the knight . and struck him such hard blows with his fists that . had not the priest and another man pulled him off .
`` yes , just so , '' said the [female] , as she poured out some more wine . and held it to his lips , again he drank . and a living joy streamed through every vein . [male] gazed on the young [male] ; it was [male] . and yet it was not [male] ; still less did he suppose it was the spectral phantom .
she took off the faded wind flower crown . and looked at it for a moment , `` you poor thing ! '' she said , it seems a shame . but still it can t be helped , and in a moment she had dropped it into the boiling water . which rapidly assumed the golden straw colour of a weak cup of tea .
victor came next with an armful of bric a brac . a brass candelabra and the parlor clock . [female] had the family bible . the basket of silverware from the sideboard . a copper kettle and papa 's fur overcoat .
the princess was led straight up to the throne , and explained , in a low voice . the reason of her coming , the emperor received her kindly . and declared himself fortunate at finding a vassal so brave and so charming . and begged the princess to remain in attendance on his person . now it happened that , on the very day fixed , all the cooks in the palace became intoxicated .
and [female] threw her stripped blade away saying , `` it 's only a silly game . '' but little [male] got the king , and she looked at [male] . and he smiled at her , and had no need to say anything . because a king is a king , and suddenly every girl must needs grow out of sorts with her fate . and find other blades to count , until each one had achieved a king to her satisfaction .
after supper they danced again , and acted a little play in which they pretended to be grown-up people at a party . one fairy pretended to be [male] , and barked `` wuff ! wuff , '' so like him that all the rabbits ran back into their holes in a fright . it was delightful to hear the tinkle of the fairy laughter . if you strike a glass very , very softly with a spoon several times .
notwithstanding the threats uttered by the fairy , in order to prevent her from revisiting the spot where she might again behold [female] . she proposed this voyage to the prince of the peaceful island . at first he refused , [male] had forbidden him to let [male] go out of his dominions . she continued to press him , he adored her . and was ignorant of the passion she had formerly entertained for [male] .
joza departed with a heavy heart , dreading to meet [male] . and when he told him in the evening . he made no reply , but a black frown covered his whole face . and his eyes shot fire , just after midnight the moon arose . and the startled [male] heard , at every blow of the drill .
note : `` to marry into '' : as a rule the wife enters the home of her husband 's parents . but when there is no male heir , it is arranged that the son in law continues the family of his wife 's parents . and lives in their home , the custom is still very prevalent in [location] . but it is not considered very honorable in [location] to enter into a strange family in this way . it is characteristic that [male] , as a punishment for disdaining to `` marry into ''
but it was of no use , for croak . croak after her as he might , she would not listen to him . but made haste home , and very soon forgot all about the poor frog . who had to betake himself to his well again , the next day , when the king 's daughter was sitting at table with the king and all the court . and eating from her golden plate , there came something pitter patter up the marble stairs .
then the [female] climbed into a tree , and , seating herself in the branches . began to knit , she remained here , living on the fruit that grew on the tree . and without laughing or uttering a word , as she sat in her tree . the king , who was hunting , had a favourite hound , who very soon discovered her . ran to the tree on which the [female] sat , sprang up to it .
the words were hardly out of his mouth when the stream swelled and overflowed till it reached the rock up which he had climbed . and dashed so far up it that the spray flew over him . but he clung on tight , and after failing to reach him three times the stream returned to its proper course . then the prince climbed down , dried himself in the sun . and set out on his march home , he spent the night once more at the mill and gave the miller his answer .
without answering him , i applied at two or three other stalls , but the only result was a shaking of heads and a curious . wide gaze , as of mild alarm , there was nothing to do but to search out unaided the most pretentious house in the city . for such a house , undoubtedly , would be the governor 's residence . we ascended a hill , and came to a park gate . at a point from which we could see the entire city below us .
he went into the water without touching him . oh , sighed the duckling , how thankful i am for being so ugly . even a dog will not bite me , and so he lay quite still . while the shot rattled through the rushes , and gun after gun was fired over him . it was late in the day before all became quiet , but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move .
the reigning king 's son , being one day out hunting . was stopped in the chase by this great wood , inquired what wood it was and what were those towers which he saw appearing out of the midst of it . every one answered as he had heard , some said it was an old castle haunted by spirits . others said it was the abode of witches and enchanters . the most common story was that an ogre lived there , a giant with long teeth and claws .
but what an uproar awaited [female] and [female] on their return from the festival ! telling a wicked and lying story , [female] and [female] had gone about among the villagers . picturing [female] as a violent and dangerous ruffian whom it was unsafe to have about . and urging that the wanderers lad be sent away from the village . now [male] was very rich , and there were many in his debt who dared not disagree with him .
and first she laid a cunning plot to punish that poor old [male] . instead of letting him die in peace , for she told his daughters . `` i can make old things young again ; i will show you how easy it is to do. '' so she took an old [male] and killed him . and put him in a cauldron with magic herbs .
in the garden of paradise , beneath the tree of knowledge . bloomed a rose [male] , here , in the first rose , a bird was born . his flight was like the flashing of light . his plumage was beauteous , and his song ravishing . but when [female] plucked the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
chung 's tender heart was filled with sympathy . and he at once gave orders for the boatmen to go and rescue him . his wife , however , reminded him of the warning of the priest not to save any man on the river . as he would inevitably turn out to be an enemy , who would in time work his rescuer great wrong . [male] replied that at such a time , when a human being was in extreme danger of being drowned .
`` i think i could , '' said the princess , and her heart being greatly softened towards him . she wished that he might become the handsomest prince in all the world . no sooner had she done so than [female] with the tuft appeared in her eyes the most elegant young man she had ever seen . however this may be , it is certain that the princess married him . that either she retained her good sense .
young and handsome appeared little interested in what was passing around , she ate scarcely any supper . fell into frequent fits of musing , and the princes . her lovers , attentive to all her actions , imagined that they heard her sigh several times . she dismissed all the court very early , and retired to her apartments . when one is looking forward to a meeting with those we love .
a week afterwards , young and handsome and the lovely shepherd took an excursion in a fine barge . gilt all over , on the beautiful river which encircled the castle of flowers . followed by all their little court in the prettiest boats in the world . the barge of young and handsome was shaded by a canopy formed of a light blue and silver tissue . the dresses of the rowers were of the same material .
all things are dangerous for the hermit ; it is sometimes a danger for him to read in the scriptures that the divine master journeyed from town to town and supped with his disciples . the virtues that the anchorites embroider so carefully on the tissue of faith . are as fragile as they are beautiful ; a breath of ordinary life may tarnish their pleasant colours . for that reason , [male] avoided the towns . fearing lest his heart should soften at the sight of his fellow men .
so saying , he opened his sack and gave her the bad one . the witch suspected no evil , and her mouth watered to taste the new dish . so that she went into the kitchen to prepare it herself . when it was ready she could not wait till it was served at the table . but she immediately took a couple of leaves and put them in her mouth .
farmer brown was an old-fashioned farmer . he firmly believed in that quaint and worn-out saying . `` early to bed , early to rise , '' he could not get along at all with the modern type of farmhands . so , after thinking matters over , brown decided to reform , after many trials he secured a strapping . big fellow , and resolved to keep that hand at any cost .
at length he altogether ceased to associate with the merry band of youths and maidens . their mirthsome noise was unpleasant to him . whilst , on the contrary , the still solitude became more and more dear to him . and the shepherd was happy and joyful ; that longing of his heart which had so often drawn him towards the stone . was gloriously satisfied , he dwelt , remote from the world , in the bosom of happiness .
then they went together into the town , and soon they came to a butcher 's stall . and the sparrow said to the dog , `` stay here while i reach you down a piece of meat , '' and he perched on the stall , looked round to see that no one noticed him . and pecked , pulled , and dragged so long at a piece that lay near the edge of the board that at last it slid to the ground . the dog picked it up , ran with it into a corner .
`` yes , it 's a good bridge , '' agreed mr. [male] . he stopped watching [male] and examined the bridge . it did seem safe , it really did look like someone had just built it . the path on each side only went about ten feet into the woods and stopped . there did not seem to be any reason for anyone to build a bridge in the middle of the woods .
desperately they clung to the splintered pieces of debris . to the dog house that spun over and over , to the gate that turned upside down . or straddled logs that kept rolling with brownies first up and then under like teetotums . and others , not so fortunate , with strength fast leaving them . still swam the waters seeking and groping in vain for some object to sustain them .
[male] makes halt at ottesworde . there he dismisses his warriors , presents them with their horses and harness . and gives them leave to ride home and greet his wife . he intends to risk his life alone in the roaring waters . but they are to bear witness for him that it is not his fault if [male] glob stands without reinforcement in the church at [location] .
the next day , when [male] was away from home . the prince came again to his wife to learn what he had told her . she repeated everything carefully , and the prince went straight away to his brothers in law with the much longed for news . they received it with joy . and at once set out with the prince to go to that mountain peak , arrived there .
suddenly , amid the crowd of mourners who composed the widow 's train . appeared a [female] figure , deeply veiled , with hands uplifted in an attitude of intense grief . those that stood near her felt a shudder creep over them . they shrank back , and thus increased the alarm of those whom the stranger next approached . so that confusion gradually spread itself through the whole train .
so sir [male] returned to uterysdale , and long continued to use his power to protect the bold outlaws . and [male] dwelt securely in the greenwood , doing good to the poor and worthy . but acting as a [male] in the sides of all oppressors and tyrants . hereward was , naturally , the darling hero of the saxons . and for the patriotism of his splendid defence of ely they forgave his final surrender to [male] .
-- an [person] , as is developed in a later chapter , is the name given the spirit of a dead person . the [person] dwell in and about the pueblo . and , among other of their functions , they cause almost all diseases and ailments of the people and practically all deaths . the accompanying photo was an instantaneous exposure , taken in the twilight . the people could not be induced to wait for a time exposure .
as soon as he got the letter the husband took an axe . and went to the holly tree , when he came to the tree he found the princess there before him . having the two boxes with the fox and the hawk in them . he struck the tree a few blows . it split open , and out sprang the wether , he ran scarce twenty perches before the fox caught him .
so [male] put out a leg , and mr. [male] got a chopper . and chopped it off , and pops it in the pot . suddenly he calls out : [male] . my dear , [male] , and nobody answered , so he went into the next room to look out for mrs. [female] . and while he was there , [female] crept out from under the sofa and ran out of the door .
adrian had nearly completed his twentieth year , [male] was eighteen , and [male] near sixteen . when a messenger arrived at the castle , bringing with him a packet addressed to its master . the contents of which announced the landing of a very old friend at a place on the coast at a considerable distance . he mentioned having intelligence of infinite consequence to impart . and his intention of proceeding directly to the castle for that purpose .
years and years ago at the very beginning of time . when the world had just been made , there was no night , it was day all the time . no one had ever heard of sunrise or sunset . starlight or moonbeams , there were no night birds . nor night beasts , nor night flowers .
they each put on the habit of a foreign merchant . and under that disguise went out by a private door of the palace garden . which led into the country , after they had gone round part of the city to the banks of the euphrates . at some distance from the walls , without having observed anything disorderly . they crossed the river in the first boat they met .
david was now in the forest beyond the woodlands , you perceive . for he had stepped into this country when he passed through the little door that led from the other side of the great tree . in this land things happen otherwise than in our land . or , if they do not actually happen otherwise , it seems so to those who live there . for everyone there is able to understand the inside of a thing as well as the outside .
only this : it is not always the silliest one that sits kicking his feet in the ashes at home . the dial marks the hour of noon .

the best way to learn something about the author of [male] is to study with care the portrait given as the frontispiece of this book . you shall form your own opinion of the man from the artist 's drawing and that opinion will depend greatly upon the amount of enjoyment and the number of ideas you have got from his story . his name is sufficient guide to his nationality . and you will know by easy guesswork that you have been reading a translation of his tale . but the change from french to english is so well made that not much is lost of the charm of the story as [male] wrote it .
will you be pleased to allow me the comfort of giving her this last testimony of my friendship ? [female] having consented to it , [female] was sent for . who came with all possible diligence , the sultan went to bed with [female] upon an alcove raised very high . according to the custom of the monarchs of the east . and [female] lay in a bed that was prepared for her .
then , for gratitude , the king would have given his daughter to victor for a wife . but victor remembered [female] , and knew that no other [male] must be bride of his . not long after this the king was lost overboard at sea during a storm . now the people must have a new ruler , they determined to choose a wise and brave man . and , young as he was , no man could be found braver and wiser than victor .
she was digging in the cottage garden . for [female] would do no work at home . when a very old man toiled slowly up the hill , his clothes were dusty . and his staff was bent ; he looked very weary . and his voice , as he bade her `` goodmorrow , ''
sir , continues [male] , such was the end of the grecian king . and the physician [male] ; i must return now to the story of the fisherman and the genie . but it is not worth while to begin it now , for it is day . the sultan , who always observed his hours regularly , could stay no longer , but got up . and having a mind to hear the sequel of the story of the genie and .
then the princes went on eating and drinking . and after they had finished they journeyed on again , presently they came to a cross roads . and there they separated ; one went east and one went west . the eldest prince took the east road , and soon it brought him to a castle . and in this castle lived a princess who was as pretty as a picture .
a seneschal harnessed to a cow 's tail is a sight not to be seen every day . and all the peasants in the neighborhood crowded together to wonder at the spectacle . but , torn as he was by the cactuses of barbary and the thickets of tartary . the seneschal had lost nothing of his haughty air . with a threatening gesture he dispersed the rabble , and limped to his house to taste the repose of which he began to feel the need .
suddenly , [female] saw what it meant , the magic of the glass was to last only for three trials . once , before he knew its worth , he had wasted it upon the spider . the rat , and the singing bird , once the dragon had felt its power . its third and last spell had turned [male] into a midget . now its virtue was gone , it was but a piece of ordinary crystal .
i arrived at my father 's capital . the usual place of his residence , where , contrary to custom , i found a great guard at the gate of the palace . who surrounded me as i entered , i asked the reason . and the commanding officer replied , prince , the army proclaimed the grand vizier king instead of your father . who is dead ; and i take you prisoner in the name of the new king .
well , the talk ended there , in the morning the poor man moves on towards the black castle . when he arrives there , he saw that it whirled of itself on a golden cock 's foot . like some infernal spindle ; and nowhere can he see either window or door upon it . nothing but the naked wall , he took the swineherd 's axe and struck the wall . and sparks flew from the axe in such style that it could not be better .
he then took the letter to [male] 's kinsman . and presented him with a clasp set with jewels of inestimable beauty and value . as an earnest of the reward he had deserved . for the pleasure he had given him . [female] 's kinsman had scarcely departed , when the queen and princess [female] sent to enquire how the prince had passed the night .
h. if so , tell me , first , what passage in it is most sublime . secondly , which most commanding , thirdly , which most just , fourthly , which most alarming . fifthly , which most encouraging , sixthly , that which jews and christians both believe in . seventhly , that in which god has spoken purely of himself . that where he speaks of the angels ; that in which he mentions the prophets .
to finish the description of this place , which may well be called a gulf . since nothing ever returns from it , it is not possible for ships to get off when once they approach within a certain distance . if they be driven thither by a wind from the sea . the wind and the current impel them ; and if they come into it when a land wind blows . which might seem to favour their getting out again , the height of the mountain stops the wind .
the cooking pot was wonderful , too , no matter what was put into it . it cooked deliciously whatever was wanted without any firing -- truly a very economical saucepan . the fame of [male] 's fortune spread far and wide . and as there was no need for him to spend money on rice or silk or firing . he became very rich and prosperous , and was henceforth known as my lord bag of rice .
`` that is not so easy , '' said he , `` but i will try what i can do . '' and transporting himself to his palace to obtain a little bottle of poisoned water . he waited till nightfall . and started at once for [male] 's tower , of course . had [male] consulted his books he would have seen what his enemy was doing .
who , somewhat alarmed , ran back a few paces and stood with the spit in his hand . foreseeing a rough attack , and it soon came , for the bear . rearing himself up , walked leisurely forward , and putting out one of his paws caught hold of the spit . jerked it out of the goblin 's hand . and sent it spinning to the other end of the kitchen .
when they got outside the church , they all went to [female] 's cottage to congratulate her on her baby . and to tell her what good lungs it had , and what a handsome face . and how it was exactly like its father , [female] smiled at [female] and [female] . but they had no eyes except for the baby . and for all that belonged to it , especially its cradle , now a russian baby has a very much finer cradle than an english baby .
lars thanked the duke , and asked him to put the paper on the chair in front of the bed when he retired to rest . and he would be sure to fetch it during the night . the duke did as he was told ; and so he and the princess lay down and went to sleep . but early in the morning the duke awoke and felt so cold that his teeth chattered . and when he had got his eyes quite open he found he was quite naked and had not even as much as a thread on his back .
one of the simplest examples of wind is to be found at the seaside . there in the daytime the land gets hot under the [person] . and heats the air , making it grow light and rise . meanwhile the [person] on the water goes down deeper , and so does not send back so many heat waves into the air . consequently the air on the top of the water is cooler and heavier .
he whispered , laying his bony cheek on the stones -- ', dearest [male] ! and while he stood there thinking of his mother , and of how he would go and bring down a pot of honeycomb for her death shadow . and then of his father ; and then of the strange journey they were all going to set out on when [female] returned to her mountains . and then of his wonderstone ; and then of [male] , prince of the valleys . his peacocks and ummuz cane , and ummuz cane , and ummuz cane -- while he was thus softly thinking of all these happy things .
his first act was to employ the water devil . who caused a great flood to rush over the country , this swamped the poor people out of their homes . and when the empress [female] saw the plight of her subjects . and knew it was [female] 's fault . she declared war against him .
she selected a large number of attendants . and the swift flight of the princess and her retinue through the air caused a violent storm to rage over the lands they crossed . like a thick black cloud they swooped down on the land where bar [female] dwelt . and their weird cries seemed like the wild shrieking of a mighty hurricane . down they swept in a tremendous storm such as the city had never known .
dulcie took it with awe . he was a very fine gentleman indeed , and the two children could not help staring at him as he smoothed his hair in silence . he was short and stout , in a costume not unlike that of [male] in the pantomime . only the colouring was green and blue , his goggle green eyes and wide . down drawn mouth made him look comically like a carp .
when the pagan gods of [female] -- the tuath de danān -- robbed of worship and offerings . grew smaller and smaller in the popular imagination , until they turned into the fairies . the pagan heroes grew bigger and bigger , until they turned into the giants . immediately on his smelling the cold air of this world the child sneezed . which was naturally taken to be a good sign of his having a clear head .
scarcely was she seated in the regal wampum chair . thinking of the fairy queen . when she was almost there ; and soon her fine fish monster drew down his under jaw a sea lion from ocean deep held out his ugly paw . she tripped down quite gracefully and took the lion 's paw . but i really can not tell you all the riches that she saw .
[female] is represented as a woman of florid complexion . with dishevelled hair , and her whole appearance angry and menacing , in one hand she brandishes a poniard and a hissing adder . whilst in the other she carries a burning torch . her dress is torn and disorderly , and her hair intertwined with venomous snakes . this divinity was never invoked by mortals , except when they desired her assistance for the accomplishment of evil purposes .
nor -- whether or not the day of fairies was over -- did the princess ever see anything further of her seven godmothers . she lived a long and happy life , like any other ordinary woman . and died at length , beloved , regretted , but , the prince being already no more , perfectly contented . there once lived in a village a faggot maker and his wife . who had seven children , all boys ; the eldest was no more than ten years old .
a little before supper time we both stole on tip toe into the professor 's study . he was writing , as usual , and did not notice us , [male] went up to his chair from behind and gently put her hands over his eyes . and asked if he could guess who it was , he , of course . guessed all the names he could think of , except the right one . `` papa , '' said [male] , at last , restoring to him once more the use of his eyes .
the prince stood speechless at this command . but the king did not condescend to give any further explanation , and when he was dismissed the young man flew to the room which had been set aside for him . and pulling out his feather , he cried : `` dove , dove , be quick and come . '' `` what is it ? '' said the dove , flying in through the open window . and the prince told her of the task before him .
there he would have a hundred horses and a hundred sheep and a hundred silken robes . a hundred swords , a hundred bows , and a hundred youths to follow him . while she would have a hundred maidens to wait on her . but how , he asked , was he to reach this island ? he was to mount her horse and ride behind her .
now the raja 's chief officer was a tehsildar . and he had also a [male] , who shaved him every day . and that evening after the jogis had run away , the tehsildar proposed to the [male] that . when shaving the raja the next morning , he should cut the raja 's throat and they could then divide the kingdom between them . and the [male] consented , not content with this , the tehsildar and the palace chowkidar that same night tried to break into the raja 's palace and steal his money and jewellery .
when the feast was over the princes asked the bridegroom if he would like to walk through the palace and see all there was to be seen . then the happy fisherman , following his bride , the sea king 's daughter . was shown all the wonders of that enchanted land where youth and joy go hand in hand and neither time nor age can touch them . the palace was built of [female] and adorned with pearls . and the beauties and wonders of the place were so great that the tongue fails to describe them .
then , amid a burst of wild , sweet music , the frost king placed the flower crown on his head . and knelt to little violet ; while far and near , over the broad green earth . sounded the voices of flowers , singing their thanks to the [female] fairy . and the summer wind was laden with perfumes . which they sent as tokens of their gratitude .
and [female] promised , and at the bidding of [female] one of the nymphs sped down to the land of the shades . and for seven days [female] and her sisters awaited her return . her face was as the face of a white [female] and her eyes were dark with sadness when she came . but with her she bore the helmet of [female] . and when she and her sisters had kissed [male] and bidden him a sorrowful farewell .
one thing made her think of another , until at length she had cleaned every thing she could think of . now surely she must find some food in the hole ! when this time also there was nothing , she began once more to abuse the wise woman as false and treacherous , but ah ! there was the bed unwatered , that was soon amended. -- still no supper , ah ! there was the hearth unswept . and the fire wanted making up , -- still no supper , what else could there be ?
he crawled up a gooseberry [male] and saw many yellow barrels hanging among the leaves . he stuck his dagger into one and found that it was filled with excellent wine . so he cut the stems of several others which fell to the ground . he then went to the second [male] , full of red globes that shone like glass . he cut into one and found that it held a delicious , tart wine .
it is quite possible that all these things are mere coincidences . certainly we shall not argue , because the most moral form of [person] in boots gives [location] a gazelle in place of a cat . and because a certain arab clan mourns gazelles . while the gazelle hero is found in the story of a half arab race . that , therefore , the swahili gazelle story is the original form of [person] in boots .
i can not say i much approve of man and wife at all times opening each other 's letters . there is more , i think , of vulgar familiarity in this than of delicacy or confidence . besides , a sealed letter is sacred ; and every one likes to have the first reading of his or her own letters . perhaps your husband may be fond of absenting himself from home . and giving to others that society which you have a right to expect .
on the northern boundaries of [location] , and still more frequently on the siberian coast . are found boneyards containing tusks of ivory in quantities so great as to suggest the burying places of antiquity . from [person] jansen 's account . they have come from the great prolific animal life that abounds in the fields and forests and on the banks of numerous rivers of the inner world . the materials were caught in the ocean currents .
his long speech about ourselves is full of wisdom and warning . read it again and again , the last portion is very beautiful , and what a wonderful way the dwarfs had of finding things out without books . [male] of the moor was easily traced , king [male] is very undwarflike or . let [location] say , very human when he learns where [male] is . but would the laugh of these little creatures even in unison be a jovial great guffaw ', ?
on this scrap of paper were written three pieces of advice . first , if a person is travelling and reaches any strange place at night . let him be careful where he puts up , and not close his eyes in sleep . lest he close them in death . secondly , if a man has a married sister , and visits her in great pomp .
[female] stammered a weak proposal , and [female] essayed an incoherent objection . but she trembled and became unintelligible ; and when he attempted to throw in a few nods of generous approval they came in at the wrong places . with one accord they arose and sought their stools . [female] tried it again , she succeeded in saying her father was over young to marry . and [organization] [female] would cry if she took care of him .
still there were trees growing thickly together , and retarding and making difficult one 's advance . but , just when he was growing discouraged , they began to thin out , and he came into more open spaces . finally he reached a tiny lake that shone like a turquoise in a bowl like formation at the base of a steep hill . a path ran up the hillside , and this evidently had been much in use . for the grass was worn and trodden by many feet , on a ledge there was an old .
[female] had all he could do to keep from laughing outright . but safety bade him restrain the impulse . and in a moment he had climbed over the steel grillwork and entered the sacred precincts of ready money . once within the teller 's cage his heart began to thump so violently that it seemed impossible for him to escape detection . but so busy were all the bank people with the duties of the day that no one seemed to hear .
thinking that a king of that sort was an insult to their dignity . they sent to [male] a second time . and begged him to take away the sluggish king he had given them . and to give them another and a better one , [male] , annoyed at being pestered in this way . sent a [male] to rule over them , who no sooner arrived among them than he began to catch and eat the frogs as fast as he could .
weeping , i assured them of my prudence . and after embracing me tenderly , they went their ways . thirty nine days passed away more rapidly than i could have conceived possible , and the following morning the princesses were to return to the castle , but alas ! i had explored every corner , save only the room that was shut in by the golden door . and i had no longer anything to amuse myself with .
but he was dismayed when he saw the desert fairy . mounted on a winged [female] , and with her head covered with snakes . strike the princess so hard with a lance , that she fell into the queen 's arms . covered with blood , he immediately left the combat . to go to the relief of his beloved , but the dwarf was too quick for him .
[female] steered his boat to shore , and stepped from it . and looked about for some way by which he could cross the moat . and try for entrance to the castle , then he saw a little hut near . and beside it lay an old man apparently fast asleep . he was small and dark , and his face was gray and wrinkled as a monkey 's .
all the spectators knew the spot well , the child 's arms were round the neck of the pig . and he was in a deep sleep , the lamp before the picture of the [male] threw a strong light on the pale . delicate face of the child , it was a beautiful picture . a large gilt frame surrounded it . and on one corner of the frame a laurel wreath had been hung .
the queen sent word to the princess that unless she gave up the comb . she would have her life , the princess returned as answer that she would give up the comb if she might pass one night with the queen 's husband . the queen was willing , and gave her husband a draught as before . when the princess came , he was fast asleep , and did not waken till after she had gone in the morning . on the third day the washerwoman and the princess went out to walk .
when at dinner on the following sunday , mr. [male] informed his young visitor of his having at last succeeded in procuring for him a situation as clerk in the old established house of messrs. davies .

she might have continued for long in this fashion had not the voice of a crow directly overhead attracted her attention . looking up to see what was the matter she beheld , in the dim light . a crow holding a fat frog in his claws . which he evidently intended for his supper , the queen rose hastily from the seat . and striking the bird sharply on the claws with the fan which hung from her side .
there was a ship named `` the purple , '' so strong and so great that she feared neither winds nor waves . even when they were raging most terribly , `` the purple '' swept on , with every sail set . she rose upon each swelling wave and crushed with her conquering prow hidden rocks on which other ships foundered . she moved ever forward with sails which were gleaming in sunlight . and moved with such swiftness that foam roared at her sides and stretched out behind in a broad , endless road streak .
[person] is the staple food . and most families have sufficient for subsistence during the year . when [person] is needed for food bunches of the palay . as tied up at the harvest , are brought and laid in the small pocket of the wooden mortar where they are threshed out of the fruit head . one or two mortarsful is thus threshed and put aside on a winnowing tray , when sufficient has been obtained the grain is put again in the mortar and pounded to remove the pellicle .
the bee man hesitated a moment , and then he walked toward the woman . hearing him coming , she raised her head . and when she saw the child she rushed toward it . snatched it into her arms . and screaming with joy she covered it with kisses .
when the magician heard this the blood rushed to his face . and his eyes became like hot coals , [male] was left [male] with fear . and for three days the magician was not seen by anyone . at the end of that time he reappeared . and this time it was the dress of sunbeams that he had brought back with him .

the brahman looked up as the disciple came in , and he saw that just behind was walking a young girl . he at once married the girl to his disciple and gave them a house to live in close by his own . now , on the first monday in the month of shravan . or august , the disciple got up and said to his wife , i am going out to worship the god [male] . but do not wait for me , just eat your breakfast directly you feel hungry .
`` that 's true , [female] , '' said she , so she brought out a good cake . and a print of butter , and a bottle of milk . thinking he would take them away to the bog . but [male] kept his seat , and never drew rein till bread . butter , and milk went down the red lane .
when the king awoke he was struck dumb at the sight of the magnificent house shining in the rays of the sun . the servants could not do their work for stopping to stare at it . then the king dressed himself , and went to see the young man . and he told him plainly that he was a very powerful prince . and that he hoped that they might all live together in one house or the other .
the sun seemed to lavish its choicest rays upon the little tree . heaven dropped its sweetest dew upon it , and the winds never came to the forest that they did not forget their rude manners and linger to kiss the little tree and sing it their prettiest songs . no danger ever menaced it , no harm threatened . for the angel never slept , -- through the day and through the night the angel watched the little tree and protected it from all evil . oftentimes the trees talked with the angel ; but of course they understood little of what he said .
but the little daughter of the snow only laughed , `` by frosty night and frosty day , '' she sang , and ran out of the door , laughing back at them with shining eyes . and so it went on all through the winter , the little daughter of the snow was singing and laughing and dancing all the time . she always ran out into the night and played by herself till dawn . then she would come in and have her ice porridge , then she would play with the children .

everychild thanked the old man again ; and then , together with all his companions . he entered the old house which had been pointed out to him . there was , indeed , no trace of ghostly occupants of the house . but on the contrary , the rooms , upstairs and down , speedily became the scene of much jollity . it seemed , also , that the old man had spread the report among the townspeople that a band of children had taken refuge in the house for the night .
among other things , this [female] child had to go twice a day to draw water more than a mile and a half from the house . and bring home a pitcherful of it . one day , as she was at this fountain . there came to her a poor woman , who begged of her to let her drink . `` oh , yes , with all my heart , [female] , '' said this pretty little girl .
then on the top of the mountain that is called hindfell he had a hall built that faced the south . ten dwarfs built it of black stone , and when the hall was built he put round it a wall of mounting and circling fire . more did [male] all father : he took a [male] of the tree of sleep and he put it into the flesh of the battle maiden . then , with her helmet on her head and the breast mail of the valkyrie upon her . he lifted [male] in his arms and carried her through the wall of mounting and circling fire .
on each christmas eve an angel comes to him and tells him that all he has dreamed is true . and that he may go to sleep again in peace , as denmark is not yet in any real danger . but should danger ever come , then [male] danske will rouse himself . and the table will burst asunder as he draws out his beard . then he will come forth in his strength .

yes , indeed , that would suit her right down to the ground ; she would gladly give him two kisses with every dollar . and feel grateful , besides , so she got the whistle . but when she reached the castle , the whistle disappeared all of a sudden .

the girl had only once heard from the old woman that they were fished from the river in a chest . and that the despised woman in the king 's palace door was their mother . whom the king 's two daughters in law had put in that position by falsehood . after the death of their benefactors , the sister and brother continued to live in the hut . the lad went hunting , and the [female] used to visit the court .
now it befell that the poor queen had heard , through her maidens . of the rumours concerning herself and sir [male] . and , taking counsel of no one , she bethought how she could prove to the remnant of the round table that she was free of any plots against the king or the fair kingdom of britain . therefore , at that dinner , she had sir [male] and his brethren . that is to say , sir [male] , sir [male] .
one day the mother sent her children into the wood to pick up sticks . they found a big tree lying on the ground . it had been felled , and towards the roots they noticed something skipping and springing . which they could not make out , as it was sometimes hidden in the grasses . as they came nearer they could see it was a dwarf .

poor [male] , he took the little blue shoes in a hurry . and his tears were dropping all the time , `` good-bye , little blue shoes , '' he said , but the hop about man did not seem to notice , and when [male] gave them to him he put them upon his feet . but he did not stir , not an inch , then [male] sighed a long sigh . and he flew over the bye-bye meadow till he reached the garden of the stir about wife .

bitterly repenting his slowness , he wandered towards the forest where a fire was burning . hardly knowing what he did ; but on his way he almost fell over the skin . which was lying across his path , ah , fool that i was ! this must be the skin she wished me to burn , ', said he . and seizing it in both hands he flung it into the fire .
there came by a pedlar , whose name was stout , he cut her petticoats round about . he cut her petticoats up to the knees . which made the old woman to shiver and freeze , when this old woman first did wake . she began to shiver , and she began to shake ; she began to wonder . and she began to cry -- `` lawkamercyme , this is none of i !

you have a clean and comfortable bathing machine , dress , linen . and all appliances ; and the charge for the whole is half a franc , or fivepence . on the pier , there is usually a guitar , which seems presumptuously enough to set its tinkling against the deep hoarseness of the sea . and there is always some boy or woman who sings , without any voice . little songs without any tune : the strain we have most frequently heard being an appeal to `` the sportsman ''
the king ran as fast as he could , but the wind ran faster still . and in a moment the princess was whirled to the bottom of the garden . which was bounded by a ditch , she cleared it like a bird . and the king , who was obliged to stop short at the edge . saw the lovely [female] flying over the plain , sometimes driven to the right .
now [female] was by this time very tired , and she went upstairs to the chamber . and there she found three beds , she tried the largest bed . which belonged to the big bear , and found it too soft ; then she tried the middle sized bed . which belonged to the middle sized bear , and she found it too hard . then she tried the smallest bed , which belonged to the little bear .
`` what made you let go ? '' roared [male] , and his voice sounded hollow and unnatural as it resounded from the depths of his cool and shady retreat . oh , [male] , have you got it ? have you really ? ain t it cold ? are you hurt ? were you scared ? is the teapot broken ? were a few of the questions that came faintly to him from above and sounded very unlike angel whispers to the diver for teapots .
the shock awoke the prince at once , and , grasping the girl firmly with his arms . he kept her fast , next morning the king looking out of his window discovered to his astonishment that no pears were missing . and therefore sent a messenger into the garden to his son to inquire what had happened ? as soon as dawn began to break , the prince saw the girl 's beautiful face . the king 's messenger had by this time reached the prince .
he had a most observant and seeing eye , a walk in the street was fraught with surprise . and he would come back delighted with his adventures , every little common incident . three little boys with their backs to a wall looking up at a church tower . he would catch snatches of their talk . speculations about deep things and strange .
such a dashing and a crashing was never seen or heard before , and as each creature carried his shadow with him . you can just imagine what a lot of lights and shades there must have been . occasionally there would be a slight lull in the excitement , and the racing and the rushing would cease for awhile . each time that there was a pause in the seemingly endless races . a quaint round faced little person , dressed in short petticoats , sky blue stockings and a [female] peaked hat .
renzolla , who was really sorry for her conduct , took the old man 's advice . and the fairy not only gave her back her former face . but she dressed her in a gold embroidered dress . presented her with a beautiful carriage , and brought her back . accompanied by a host of servants , to her husband .
but instead he began to remember things of a wonderful dream . he closed his eyes ; the sea rocked him gently . as in a cradle , and slowly , slowly , with the soft arms of the mermaid about him . and her green hair twining through his fingers , he sank down through the water . as he sank the likeness of a human boy faded from him .
the common was ere long left desolate and alone , only tenanted by a grazing donkey or two . and a few wretched human creatures who wandered over every spot upon which carriages had stood and luncheons had been eaten . in the hope of finding something which they might convert into money in order to aid the necessities of their miserable lives . soon , too , these took their departure : the crowd of people returning home grew smaller and smaller . gradually the road was less and less thronged , the people were only seen going along it by twos and threes .
i ran blindly down the stairs where my mother was helping to put away the supper dishes . in the magic of the night , helping to put away the supper dishes . she turned and looked at me , her face startled . and touched me -- i remember how gently she touched me . i can not tell you who i am nor what i m going to be .
the old games that have been played by generations of children not only precede the training of the school and supplement it . but accomplish some results in the nature of the child which are beyond the reach of the school . when a crowd of boys are rushing across country in `` hounds and deer , '' they are giving lungs , heart and muscles the best possible exercise . they are sharing certain rules of honor with one another .
the girl , however , when she saw the old woman striding towards her . changed , with her magic wand , her sweetheart [female] into a lake . and herself into a duck swimming in the middle of it . the witch placed herself on the shore . threw breadcrumbs in , and went to endless trouble to entice the duck .
after this mr. [male] advised him to send for a proper tradesman . and get himself dressed like a gentleman ; and told him he was welcome to live in his house till he could provide himself with a better . mr. [male] soon saw their love for each other . and proposed to join them in marriage ; and to this they both readily agreed . a day for the wedding was soon fixed ; and they were attended to church by the lord mayor .
certainly there was a grand old fashioned lamp in the hall of the sea castle . but the hall itself was so big , and went up so high , that the light in one part only seemed to make the shadow and darkness of the other part look blacker still . so that i must confess there was something gloomy about the house . then , too , there were those two turrets with the winding staircases . and as [male] had never dared to do any thing more than peep in at the low entrance doors below .
ten years after these events the sons of the slain heroes . who were called epigoni , or descendants , resolved to avenge the death of their fathers . and with this object entered upon a new expedition against the city of thebes . by the advice of the delphic oracle the command was intrusted to [male] . the son of [male] ; but remembering the injunction of his father he hesitated to accept this post before executing vengeance on his mother [male] .
they wrote with diamond pencils on gold slates . and learned their lessons so quickly and read so easily that everyone might know they were princes . their sister [male] sat on a little stool of plate glass . and had a book full of pictures which had cost as much as half a kingdom . oh , these children were indeed happy , but they were not to remain so always .
daylong and nightlong the maid clung to [female] and to none other . and the old gray woman of shadows , whose voice was like unto the winds of autumn . made sad music of the days and ways of men . ever she spake , telling tales of sorrow . whereunto [female] listened , saying in her heart , there is no sorrow like to mine .
so he turned the pin twelve times . whereupon the gate opened immediately , with a noise like thunder . and the sheikh entered , he was a learned man . acquainted with all languages and characters , and he walked on until he entered a long passage . whence he descended some steps .
molly ryan never more saw her darling , but something of the lost little boy was seen by his former playmates . sometimes when their mother was away earning a trifle at haymaking . and [male] washing the potatoes for their dinner . or `` beatling '' clothes in the little stream that flows in the hollow close by . they saw the pretty face of little [male] peeping in archly at the door .
Little House in [location] by [female] at [organization] though it happened just that way every morning . and it had happened so this morning , this day was to be very different from any other in [male] 's life . but [male] could not know that ; so he crawled farther down under the few bedclothes he had managed to keep to himself . and shut his eyes again just for a minute , the night had been a cold one . and the other two boys in the bed , because they were older and stronger .
into this dark water there had now been dropped , two days ago , a long black hair from the tail of mr. [male] 's horse , [male] . we had been credibly informed that if you did this to a hair from a horse 's tail and left it untouched for twenty-four hours or . to be perfectly safe , for forty eight hours , the result would inevitably be a black snake . we had gone to the branchetts barn for the raw material and . finding none available on the floor , we were about to risk jerking it from the source when [male] had perceived what we needed caught in a crack of the stall .
but his father broke the horse in pieces and destroyed its works . moreover , the prince wrote a letter to the princess 's father . advising him of all that had befallen her and how she was now married to him and in all health and happiness . and sent it by a messenger , together with costly presents and rarities . the messenger , in due course , arrived at the city of [male] and delivered the letter and the presents to the king .
the devil jumped up and capered about in his joy ; standing on his toes and clapping his bony heels together . he spun the king round like a [male] and shouted in his ear . `` that girl , king , was not in your house today and i will come for her in ten years . '' the devil hereupon saddled midnight and darted off like lightning . while the guests stared at each other in amazement , and the king 's face turned ghastly pale .
the lion , the fox , and the ass entered into an agreement to assist each other in the chase . having secured a large booty , the lion , on their return from the forest . asked the ass to allot his due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty . the ass carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares . and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice , the lion .
the soft green tints were going out of my hair and the sun was putting brownness in my cheeks . soon my hair would be wheaten colored like the hair of the women of the islands and my cheeks would be brown like theirs . and then the day would come when i should have to be with the man whom i looked upon as my enemy . i put it to my lips . i drank it when he took a step towards me .
if they had had to think of it they would have said . `` it is because we can not help it . '' and every day one same thing happened to them that they could not help . the most beautiful thing in life , it came to them by instinct . taking hold of them from head to feet and saying .
with a bound [female] leaped to the top of it and looked about her . there , pushed well back against the wall , was a heavy wooden box . and the moment the cat put her nose to the keyhole she knew that the charm was inside of it . she had found the charm , and that was one thing . but how to get it out of the box was quite a different matter .
but when she saw [male] with the scimitar in his hand . and without his veil , she laid down the basin , and fled . but my brother overtaking her , cut off her head also . the wicked old woman came running at the noise , and my brother seizing her . said to her , treacherous wretch , do not you know me ?
the tsarevich called [female] straightway . and commanded him to bring the iron pillar to the kitchen and cut it into small pieces as fuel for the cook . [male] went to the place mentioned , took the pillar in his arms . brought it to the palace kitchen . and cut it into small pieces , four pieces of iron did he put in his pocket .
[female] was then conducted , dressed as she was , to the young prince . who finding her more beautiful than ever , instantly desired her to accept of his hand . the marriage ceremony took place in a few days . and [female] , who was as amiable as she was handsome , gave her sisters magnificent apartments in the palace . and a short time after married them to two great lords of the court .
the next day , accordingly , we repaired thither , setting off immediately after breakfast . to meet the surveyor and builder , who was to be on the spot . the house in question was one of a row just building . or built , whitened outside , in imitation of stone , it was no , 2 , no . one was finished ; but the windows still stained with the drippings of the whitewash and colouring , no .
`` a man do you say , '' exclaimed [male] . let [location] go down to the gate of the tower . we shall see him better there , as soon as they reached the gate . the mer man stopped to gaze on the princess , and at her sight made several signs of admiration . he said something to her in a very hoarse voice .
the gardens had no attractions for her , her court endeavoured to entertain her . but the monkeys lost their labour in frisking . and the parrots and other birds in chattering and singing , she was impatient for the visit of the beast . the noise of whose approach she expected to hear every instant . but the hour so much desired came without the appearance of the monster .
everychild and his companions were now journeying through a country where the evenings were very long . and thus it chanced that after they had all departed from the old woman who lived in a shoe . there was still a considerable period of daylight before them . their number was now greatly augmented by the sons and daughters of the old woman . and as a result , they were merrier than they had been before .
the horse settled down on the soft sward , and [person] and [person] sprang from its back . glad to feel once more the firm earth under them . they refreshed themselves , drinking of the clear cool water . they rested in the soft moss ; they gathered fruit and berries in the woods near at hand . they told one another of all that had taken place ; and there was much to relate .
we stared at one another , i , as the one chiefly disappointed , looked away . i looked down the street : mr. [male] was hoeing in his garden . delivery wagons were rattling by , the butter man came whistling round the house . everybody seemed so busy and so sure , they looked as if they knew why everything was . and to us , truth and justice and reason and the results to be expected in this grown-up world were all a confusion and a [female] .
and all the children out of the lane -- yes , even out of the little lane at the back . flocked to the place , and each gave a button , many were noticed to go about on that afternoon with only one suspender . but then they had seen puggie 's grave . and the sight was worth much more , but in front of the tan yard . close to the entrance , stood a little girl clothed in rags .
at length in her grief she went out . and the youngest kid ran with her , when they came to the meadow . there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook . she looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly . ah , heavens , she said , is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper .
and the giant showed him a bed . and told him he had better lie down upon it and go to sleep . the bed was , however , too big for the tailor , so he did not stay in it . but crept into a corner to sleep , as soon as it was midnight the giant got up . took a great staff of iron and beat the bed through with one stroke .
and so little [female] awoke from her swoon to a new and wonderful life . it almost seemed in later years , as she looked back to that time . that she had entered another world ; for she found love . riches , education , all awaiting her , once or twice since , in lonely walks . she has found the ghost flower .
right gladly were the services of the plucky old salt accepted by the gallant little band . and taking it in turns to relieve him of his burden . they jovially marched along , the way was enlivened by many a good chorus . until the old king complained of a headache , when every one had to be quiet and talk only in quite a low tone . while [male] soothed the old fidget , and lulled him to sleep .
in this way the spring and summer and autumn passed . and when the winter came again it chanced that on a stormy night . when thunder was rattling through the forest , smiting the huge oaks and hurling them crashing to the earth . [male] lay awake thinking of his present lot . and wondering what the future might have in store for him .
bova and [female] now returned with [female] 's sons to the city of kostel . and when they arrived at the castle [male] said to the tsarina . `` here are your children , lady , '' the remains of the army he made swear allegiance to [male] 's sons . and left them to govern as before , then [male] rode with the knight [male] and the fair [male] to the city of sumin . to his attendant [male] , in order to raise a small army to march against king [male] and expel him from the city of [location] .
for he was of great capacity in everything . he therefore told him , that he would leave it to his daughter . whether she would have him or not , the king then asked his daughter . and she replied , `` what your majesty doth for me is well done . '' the king then gave his consent for her marriage with him .
one , when she would not kiss him on the mouth . bit her hands , so [male] stayed with the dwarfs until the cocks of svartheim crew . they showed her the mountain on the top of which the three banished from [female] had their abode . the giant women sat overlooking the world of men . `` what would you have from us , wife of [female] ? ''
then the call of [female] , the call that all in [female] have to harken to . went through the city of the gods , [male] heard it . and he had to come from his hiding place and enter the house where the gods held their council . and when he looked on [male] and saw the rage that was in his eyes . and when he looked on [male] and saw the sternness in the face of the father of the gods .
when this was done , at a given signal , they began to perform their music together . the donkey brayed , the hound barked , the cat mewed . and the cock crowed ; then they burst through the window into the room . so that the glass clattered , at this horrible din , the robbers sprang up . thinking no otherwise than that a ghost had come in , and fled in a great fright out into the forest .
soon afterward the queen came with food in her beak . and she and the king began to feed their young ones . `` now for it , '' said the bear ; and was about to follow them . `` stop a little , master [male] , '' said the wolf . `` we must wait now till the king and queen are gone again . ''
he spoke of how the heathen had worshipped the sun in the grey northern lands . then christians better taught had thanked [male] , the light of the world . for the glory of the sun , and lighted their joy fires to a better purpose . doubtless , some in this land long ago , not only at zimbabwe . but on many hills and high places , had honored the strong sun of the south .
there were tears in [female] 's eyes . but in the young man 's eyes shone courage and confidence . and the sun shone through the window . and cast his beams on the pair , and gave them his blessing . the general sat in his room , bursting hot , yes , he was still boiling .
they said that beneath the mossy ground the elves built their kitchens . they said that long nosed tengu had tea parties in the forest thrice a month . and that the fairies children played at hide and seek there every morning before seven . over and above all this they did not mind saying that the honest couple were [female] in their ways . that the woman was a wise woman .
they were followed by twenty other younger ladies . clothed after the same fashion , only their habits appeared somewhat gayer , in the middle of these appeared [female] with a majestic air . and so laden with jewels , that she could scarcely walk , she ascended the throne . and the favourite lady , who had accompanied her , stood just by her right hand . the other ladies , who were slaves , being placed at some distance on each side of the throne .
when the young lady heard that , she bade the butler bring her to where he was . and they went together to the wood , and there they found him . where he had been living on the fruits of trees through the most of the year . when the young lady saw him , she said . `` was it you came to the house where i was in the garden ? ''
great trees grew close together with their branches intertwined , so thick were they that the place looked as dark as night . when [male] came near , a marvelous thing happened , the branches slowly untwined and the trees seemed to bend apart and make a narrow pathway for his entrance . they closed immediately after him , so that his followers were closed out and he went on alone . after a long time he found himself in the courtyard of a great castle . there was not a sound or a stir ; the watchman stood sleeping at the gate .
`` away out of this , you wicked beast , '' she cried . giving it a blow with the tongs that would have broken its back . only it was a devil ; `` out of this ; no fish shall you have today ! '' but the cat only grinned at her , and went on tearing and despoiling and devouring the fish . evidently not a bit the worse for the blows , on this both the women attacked it with sticks .
and away inland , beyond the palisades and under the entrenched camp of the besiegers . the ground pitched and rocked , so that every tent fell grovelling ; and whenever the ground gaped . captains and men at arms were swallowed down in detachments . hardly had the call of old [male] 's war horn ceased , before the constable commanded the castle gates to be thrown open . and out he came leading a gaunt and hungry band of jarl folk warriors .
he knew then that they were the most ingenious and expert of all the dwarfs . and he therefore imposed on them that they should forge him a sword . the best that they could form ; its hilt should be of gold . and its belt of the same metal , he moreover enjoined . that the sword should never miss a blow , and should never rust ; and should cut through iron and stone .
pirlaps saw a look of doubt and reluctance in [male] 's eyes as he was about to consign the baby to [male] 's sticky care . so he handed the baby back to [male] and darted into a store near by where he got some clean wrapping paper . he then rolled the baby , in its nice white dress . up in the paper , taking care to leave its nose out . so it could breathe , then he handed it over to [male] .
the spaces between the windows were filled with mirrors exactly the same size as the windows . so that the whole room was walled in with windows and looking glasses . through the three windows that looked to the north could be seen far distant mountains . towering high above the surrounding country , from the three windows that faced the south could be seen the great ocean . tossing and moving and gleaming with white and silver , the eastern windows gave each morning a glorious view of the sunrise .
i will draw you a picture of the lady ascending the stairs with the shining sword . and yet i can hardly venture to do so , it will not look like her . for i can not draw the glittering light in her face . and that marble flower in her hair ; that is too handsome for me to draw . but there is no fragrance in it , and i would rather have the smallest violet that blooms in my own dear garden , good night .
so spake the aged monarch , as he leant across the battlement to stretch his hands in blessing over his former kingdom . but when the first streak of dawn showed faintly in the east . [male] and his [male] descended , the revelry ceased . the knights grasped their swords , and the glittering throng passed over court and bridge back to the heart of the mountain . while behind them the magic castle melted into mist .
but nothing happened ; for the giant did not take the trouble to lift up the lid . but sat down shortly by the fireside and began to eat his enormous supper , when he had finished he commanded his wife to fetch down his harp . [male] peeped under the copper lid and saw a most beautiful harp , the giant placed it on the table . said `` play , '' and it played of its own accord . without anybody touching it , the most exquisite music imaginable .
she promised her godmother . she would not fail of leaving the ball before midnight . and then away she drove , scarce able to contain herself for joy . the king 's son , who was told that a great princess . whom nobody knew , was come , ran out to receive her ; he gave her his hand as she alighted out of the coach .
on the bank of kalindi river is a farm where a very learned brahman lived . and he had a very beautiful daughter named [female] . when the creator fashioned her fresh and peerless loveliness , surely he must have despised the cleverness he showed before in fashioning the nymphs of heaven . then all at once [female] fell sick of a burning fever and died . and when the brahman youths saw that she was dead .
very quietly then , while the fractions were busy drinking , [female] and [female] and [female] and [female] and the snimmy and the snimmy 's wife slipped out of the garden and down the path to the dimplesmithy . they did not think it necessary to tell the [female] . who was too much crushed to be of use , or the teacup , for whom they dreaded the slightest shock . the [female] of the [female] might have been useful , only she was still frozen into the pool . the farther they got from the garden the less blighted and the more natural everything looked .
so saying , [male] struck off king [male] 's head . laid it upon a silver dish , covered it with a white cloth . and went to his mother [male] , when he entered her chamber he said to her . my [female] mother , i am come to inform you that your beloved husband [male] is quite recovered from his wounds . and has sent [location] to announce the glad tidings to you with this present .
the lids shook , the baskets quivered . and in another instant overturned , when out sprang three enormous black cats upon the floor of the room . with a yell , which seemed to burst simultaneously from the throats of all the crones and all the cats . they rushed out at the door ; flying from the charm which [person] kept earnestly shaking before their eyes . out of the door , over the green space in front of the cottage .
then the feast was spread again , and [male] told the story of his adventures . and when the prince of the sunny valley asked for the hand of [male] . [male] told his lovely sister to speak for herself . with downcast eyes and smiling lips she said . `` yes , '' and that very day was the gayest and brightest wedding that ever took place .
then [female] said : -- `` we will have some new dresses ; '' so they bought fine white muslin and lace . [female] bought a bright colored handkerchief , which she gave the duenna . who was so much pleased that she promised to help them make their dresses . as soon as the old woman went away , they all sat upon the piazza .
`` i will give you that , '' said [male] . so he freed his comrade from the anvil . the young men parted from each other , -- lun [male] went one way alone . and [male] another with [male] ni wánanan . as [male] went along he bought a skin at every house where he could find one .
she cried with hatred and disgust , but sending for the lad , asked him how he had returned so soon . and when she heard how he had brought home the thirteen eyes . and given them to the seven blind queens . she could hardly restrain her rage , nevertheless she pretended to be charmed with his success . and told him that if he would give her this pigeon also .
the stripling was deeply vexed by this observation ; it seemed to touch him to the very quick . he mused in silence , he refused to eat and made no reply when spoken to . he sat by the lodge door all the night through , looking up at the stars and sighing like one sorely distressed . the next day he asked his mother to dress the skin of the deer and to make it into moccasins for him . while he busied himself in preparing a bow and arrows .
well , [female] did not know how much a princess was worth , so he scratched his head and scratched his head . and by and by he said that he would be willing to take ten dollar and let the princess go . at this the king boiled over into a mighty fume . like water into the fire , what , did [female] think that ten dollar was a fit price for a princess ! oh , [male] had never done any business of this kind before .
said had only acted upon the impulse of the moment ; indeed , he now felt rather sorry that he had deprived the scoundrel of a well-deserved thrashing . he seized the opportunity , however , and asked for an evening a week in which to take a walk . this was granted him , and the next wednesday he set out for the fairy 's house . here he found everything as [male] had promised . first the servants gave him a wash .
thereupon stark [male] took his good shield . he was well armed , he bare his buckler . he laced on his shining helmet , he wore a broad weapon above his harness . that cut grimly with both its edges , then he sought the ferrymen up and down . he heard the splash of water and began to listen .
but we were now beginning to play our parts on a real stage . and to know something of the pathetic side of life . with its hard facts , irksome duties , many temptations . and the daily [person] of self , fortunately we had the truest . tenderest of guides and guards .
even the winds were kind to him because he moved so easily at their behest . but all winds were not alike to him who had the heart of a man . when spring came and the breezes blew from the south . heavy with the scent of magnolia , of lilacs . and blue violets , the heart of the golden archer ached with a strange hurt out of vanished years that he could not quite remember .
' [female] , [female] , she shrieked . but the wind carried her voice away , and did not bring back [female] . `` what is the use of making all that noise ? '' said a voice that came from close to her side . and when she looked round she saw the man . sitting on his bundle of sticks , eating the bread ravenously .
this was evidently a signal , for a boat had been seen hastily crossing the lake . and the sash of [male] 's window had been heard to shut down at the first alarm . mr. [male] said that , little as he liked playing the part of tale bearer . he felt that [male] was under his care . and he would not deserve his old name of downright dunstable if he did not inform her father of what he had discovered .
for he found himself in a sun bathed valley with clouds of rainbow hues in the azure sky above . in the distance he beheld a rippling lake of golden water . on the borders of which stood a palace made of gems gathered from the circling mountains which stood as sentinels around the valley . down these mountains meandered little golden rills that fed the lake . nothing stirred but gaily coloured birds , which fluttered amongst the blossoming fruit trees and the rich and dainty flowers .
two servants rushed out and seized [male] very rudely , they dragged him toward the king . who was standing with drawn carving knife , the king 's brave men with swords in their hands were all around him . `` it is all over with me now , '' said [male] . `` i do not see how i can live through this , '' then wasp nest . who had been waiting for these words , began to wake up his wasps , and things changed very quickly .
it evidently drew nearer ; for , at every instant , this wonderful object became larger and more lustrous . at length , it had come so nigh that [male] discovered it to be an immense cup or bowl . made either of gold or burnished brass , how it had got afloat upon the sea is more than i can tell you . there it was , at all events , rolling on the tumultuous billows . which tossed it up and down , and heaved their foamy tops against its sides .
so [female] did , and she pulled , and he pulled . and very soon the silk had stretched till it was nearly as large as a handkerchief . and then she shook it , and they pulled again . `` this is very good fun , '' said [female] ; `` why now it is as large as an apron . '' so she shook it again , and gave it a twitch here and a pat there .
at once he went to meet the beast , but there was cloopersteich and clapersteich . spluttering , splashing , raving , and roaring on the beast , they kept at it thus for a long time . and about the mouth of the night he cut another head off the beast . he put it on the knot and gave it to her . she gave him one of her earrings .
[male] , however , asked permission to sleep in the prince 's bed for that night . while the prince should sleep where the dog usually lay , ring said he was welcome to do so . and that he deserved more from him than that came to , so [male] went up into the prince 's bed . but after a time he came back , and told ring he could go there himself now . but to take care not to meddle with anything that was in the bed .
punctual to their hour all three appeared , eagerly watched by [female] , who lay hid in the bushes close by . suppose it was useless ; suppose the mare , and not the colt . ate the crumbs ? suppose -- but no , the mare and her rider went safely by . vanishing round a corner , while the colt , trotting along with its head on the ground . smelt the bread , and began greedily to lick up the pieces , oh , how good it was !
we have seen swan after swan soar by in glorious flight . one let his pinions glide over the strings of the golden harp . and it resounded through the north , norway 's mountains seemed to rise higher in the sunlight of former days . there was a rustling among the pine trees and the birches . the gods of the north , the heroes .
then he drew forth the head from his wallet . and when the king 's eyes fell on it . instantly he was turned into stone , just as he stood there with his sword lifted ! now all the people rejoiced , because the wicked king should rule them no longer . and they asked the boy to be their king .
one night a peasant who was returning home from a feast wandered a little farther into the tontlawald . and came back with the same story , a countless number of women and children were gathered round a huge fire . and some were seated on the ground , while others danced strange dances on the smooth grass . one old crone had a broad iron ladle in her hand . with which every now and then she stirred the fire , but the moment she touched the glowing ashes the children rushed away .
once upon a time—and a good time it was—there lived a king . i do not know exactly what his name was , or just where he lived . but it doesn t matter at all : his kingdom was somewhere between ashantee and [male] . and his name sounded a little like [male] , and a little like dolabella . and a good deal like [male] , and yet it was not quite any of them .
malley , who knew every foot of ground in the vicinity . laid such plans as to render escape by the distillers a practical impossibility . before dark one evening a party of twelve mounted constables armed with rifles started from maume . at the head of lough corrib , travelled all night . and by morning sergeant o
when the princess [female] awoke from her sleep in the wood . she looked around on all sides , but nowhere beheld prince [male] . she wept with grief and despair . and fell upon the ground , at length she arose . went into the wood , and cried aloud with all her strength .
under his feet was written this inscription : `` the conqueror of the gods. '' all this the maid beheld , and also she saw that over every door in the chamber . and there were many such doors , the words were written : `` be bold !

but they make no hostile demonstration , when these two women have reached their starting point . they again do the same thing , brandishing their spears as before . and all the guest men , except the specially dressed one , follow them by advancing with a dancing step along the enclosure . they also brandishing their spears , and also being silent , thus the whole group goes to the other end of the village . passing the grave of the deceased as they do so ; then they turn round .
she had never seen a steam launch before . or anything like it , a baby . held in his nurse 's arms , caught sight of her and waved tiny dimpled hands . calling and cooing , she saw his sparkling eyes , his light fuzzy hair . his little white dress and socks , she ran farther into the water .
adopted children have in all matters of inheritance the same rights as actual children . from the above particulars it will be seen that there is no system of descent in the female line or of mother right among the mafulu . and i could not find any trace of such a thing having ever existed with them . as to this i would draw attention to the facts that the mother 's relatives do not come in specially . as they do among the roro and mekeo people .
the leader of the pawnees , who rejoiced in the name of the rattle snake , and was painted to represent that interesting animal , approached the unhappy pig face after this . and gave him a piece of his mind upon the subject . i did not understand what he said , of course . being , as i told you before , somewhat ignorant of their language .
when they approached the great entrance to the castle there was hurried running to and fro on the ramparts . about the doors and windows , and in the halls . eager eyes looked down from the watch tower , but soon all eagerness changed to alarm . they could all see that the giant had been smitten dreadfully : that the proud yet kindly head had been brought low . silence reigned in the great reception hall when the giant entered .
so back they came , in time to get their share of what was going . and they drank the remora 's very good health . when [female] told them about the fight . but neither of them ever knew that they had been dead and done for ; because [male] invented a story that the mountain was enchanted . and that , as long as the firedrake lived , everyone who came there fell asleep .
one day he asked his grandmother for some money . she had plenty , but she would not give him any . so that evening [male] went to the pasture and caught the old woman 's black cow . he took the cow to a deserted house which stood at a distance from any other . and there he kept her two or three days .
but they made no sign of feeling . except that their mouths fell a little ajar , then he lit the last but one of his own torches by the failing flame of theirs . but it hovered sullen and blue . the air was thick , each breath he took was heavy as a sigh . he was shrunk very meagre with travel , and his little breathing bosom was nothing but a slender cage of bones above his heart .
in the morning the cellar was opened and [male] went at once to the king and said he had finished the beer and wine . and now he supposed he could have the princess as the king had promised . `` well , i must first go down to the cellar and see , '' said the king , for he could not believe it . but when he got there he found nothing but empty barrels .
there was an apple tree heavily laden with ripe fruit and a hungry man forever reaching up and plucking an apple . the apples were apples of sodom and always as the hungry man raised each new one to his mouth it turned to ashes . in another place a thirsty man was reaching with a dipper into a well and always . just as he was about to scoop up some water , the well moved away from under the dipper . at last he reached the next bridge and sure enough it was shining gold !
the table , chairs , and benches were thrown down . the washing bowl lay broken to pieces , and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed . she sought her children . but they were nowhere to be found , she called them one after another by name . but no one answered , at last , when she came to the youngest , a soft voice cried .
how or when the custom originated i could not learn , but the order had been verbally handed on from one native sergeant of the guard to another for many years . without any doubts as to its propriety or authority . till it was accidentally overheard by an european officer of the governor 's staff . in the hills and deserts of sind the belief in beings of this order . as might be expected in a wild and desolate country , is found strong and universal .
the baron continued to talk , now and then almost falling in the snow , but not permitting such slight mishaps to interrupt his discourse . which was addressed to nobody and had a general nature , touching upon dragons . marriages , crusades , and burgundy . could he have seen [male] 's more and more woe begone and distracted expression . he would have concluded his future son in law was suffering from some sudden and momentous bodily ill .
for the inhabitants of the new city , finding that he had royal blood in his veins . had chosen him to be their king , the very first decree of state which king [male] issued was . that if a [female] happened to arrive in the kingdom , mounted on a [female] bull . and calling herself [female] , his subjects should treat her with the greatest kindness and respect . and immediately bring her to the palace , you may see .
the pretended cauzee then directing his discourse to the feigned [male] . asked him what he had to lay to that merchant 's charge ? [male] after a low obeisance , informed the young cauzee of the fact . related every particular , and afterwards begged that he would use his authority . that he might not lose so considerable a sum of money .
the wind is blowing his trumpet too -- blowing it harder and harder . he blows up a storm -- a terrible storm . that increases more and more , towards the church they ride , as fast as they may through the storm . the church stands firm , but the storm careers on over field and moorland . over land and sea , [male] 's bishop reaches the church .
at this tender recollection his eyes were bedewed with tears . but he did not himself know what he had said besides . for there was wildness and confusion in his spirit . they arrived at the rocks of the moon . and mounted up to the stone fortress , the castellan .
[female] muttered a few words about its being necessary to decide , but he was overawed by the manner of his companion . plain and unpolished as it was , there was something noble and dignified about it . the toy merchant gazed at him without winking . even the half shut eye was now open , didn t i speak plainly ? said the carrier , giving the toy merchant a shake .
four pipes in five as they are seen sticking from a man 's hat show that the owners stopped smoking long before they exhausted their pipes . the oldest instrument for fire making used by the [male] igorot is now seldom found . however , practically all boys of a dozen years know how to make and use it . it is called `` co li' li , '' and is a friction machine made of two pieces of dry [male] . a 2 foot section of dead and dry [male] is split lengthwise and in one piece a small area of the stringy tissue lining the tube is splintered and picked quite loose .
they walked onwards full of joy . and soon came to the little house , the geese were sitting all round it . and had thrust their heads under their wings and were sleeping , and not one of them moved . the king and queen looked in at the window . the old woman was sitting there quite quietly spinning , nodding her head and never looking round .
it was almost like a green triumphal arch . the boxes were high , and the children knew they must not climb up on to them . but they were often allowed to have their little stools out under the rose trees . and there they had delightful games , of course in the winter there was an end to these amusements . the windows were often covered with hoar frost ; then they would warm coppers on the stove and stick them on the frozen panes .
now , before he had time to think , [male] had entangled him in his net . and he was filled with love towards [female] . she fully returned his passion , but , like a woman . she saw the difficulties in the way . and consulted sadly with [male] as to the means of overcoming them .
terrified and bewildered by the dreadful clamour in the plain , the herd boys and girls crowded round [male] and [male] . [male] stooped , gathered up [male] and [male] in his right hand . and all the rest of the herd boys and girls in his left . and then [male] raced with ten fathom strides through the forest clearing and down into the plain . behind him ran the sheep , bleating with terror .
with this [male] imagined the man said , wade , wade through the stream ', . and , being foremost on the bank , he jumped into the river and began to walk across . soon he got out of his depth and sank in the deep , driving current . but his hat was carried by the wind to the opposite shore . as it reached there a frog perched himself on it .

in the time of [female] the first the width was increased . and a contrivance was introduced for doubling the area of the top when required , by two flaps which drew out from either end . and , by means of a wedge-shaped arrangement , the centre or main table top was lowered . and the whole table , thus increased , became level , illustrations taken from mr. [male] . [male] 's article on furniture in the `` art journal ''
a complete and somewhat unnatural silence followed , like one of those awkward pauses in the conversation when we entertain stiff callers for the first time . then [female] took the precaution of marking the position of the trees in that part of the woods . on one of the firs the ravens were assembled , they caw cawed seven times to indicate their willingness to lend [female] their aid . the wizard looked at [female] closely that evening , the new born hope . perhaps , too , the sight of the handsome stranger had given an extra colour to her cheeks .
towards morning he retraced his steps . hoping to meet the youth and to tell him how completely he had again failed in his [male] . but he could not find the way to the forest . about midday , however , he came upon a hedged in garden surrounding a lonely villa . through the maze of boughs and foliage the prince could see a beautiful [female] .
when [female] aniello heard this , he told the two mice that if they would trust themselves to accompany him to the country where these rogues lived and recover the ring for him . he would give them a good lot of cheese and salt meat . which they might eat and enjoy with his majesty the king . then the two mice , after bargaining for a reward , offered to go over sea and mountain . and , taking leave of his mousy majesty , they set out .

this line is written in gold , and by itself would obtain a prize in any local competition . it is not quite clear whether the last couplet is an alternative to the couplet before or is purposely added in order to strengthen it . looking over her left shoulder it seems to me that there is a line drawn through the first one . but i can not see very clearly because of her hair , which will keep straying over the page . she added up the lines she had written already , seventeen .
the princess looked about her , but what became of the spider ? ', she said . then [female] , too , looked about , and there was the spider running across the floor toward where the princess lay . quickly he sprang from her side and set his foot upon it . there was a thin squeak and then -- there was nothing left of the little gray spinner but a tiny gray smudge on the floor . instantly the golden castle was shaken from top to bottom , and there was a sound of many voices shouting outside .
and as she said these words , her heart suddenly grew light . and she felt sure she should have her wish , so she went back to the house . and when a month had passed the snow was gone ; in two months everything was green . in three months the flowers sprang out of the earth . in four months the trees were in full leaf .
they stayed in bed till ten o'clock . did nothing all day but saunter about . and for their only diversion talked with regret of their former fine clothes and friends . `` look at our young sister , '' they said to one another . `` she is so low minded and stupid , that she is quite content with her miserable condition . ''
with these words he turned his back upon her . and the clown brought the amount of wages which was due , many an eye grew dim with tears when [female] bade farewell to her companions . shortly after sunset she was welcomed to [female] schurstab 's house . the first greeting was friendly , and she received nothing but kindness and indulgent treatment afterward . she had a sunny chamber of her own , and how large and soft her bed was !
and he chewed the corn till he felt he was growing sleepy . and then he put some grit into his mouth . and that kept him awake till the bird came , it looked about at first without seeing him . and whispering to itself , `` there is no one here , '' fluttered lightly on to the tree and stretched out his beak for the dates . then the boy stole softly up , and caught it by the wing .
little king [male] bit his lips . on reaching the gallery of porphyry he pointed out to the youth a flight of steps cut in the rock by the dwarfs . by which they ascend to earth , `` a pleasant journey , '' cried king [male] . in a [male] voice , now it happened that these steps of the dwarfs adjoined a deserted stone quarry less than a mile from the castle of clarides . as he went back to the town he laughed to himself as a man does who has done some one a good turn .
it was midnight when the mourning friends of the family of [male] left the chief mourner alone with his dead mother . his sister , fin fan . and the girl who was his betrothed wife brushed his garments as they passed him by . the latter timidly touched his hand—an involuntary act of sympathy—but if he were conscious of that sympathy . he paid no heed to it .

the princess now dismounted and , looking into the hole at the top of the mountain . discovered a flight of stairs leading downward , taking her basket on her arm . as she had been directed , [female] walked boldly down the steps until she came to a door . but then she shrank back in affright , for before the door was coiled a great serpent . not quite a mile long and fully as large around as a stick of wood .
after a time a rich neighbor , who had been ill for some years . came and offered to give [male] a large sum of money if he would tell him how he might get cured .

when the old woman reached her cabin she sat down by the door and wailed . for she knew she had no means of defending herself against the boar . while she sat crying , a vender of needles came along and asked her what was the matter . she told him , and he said that all he could do for her was to give her a box of needles . this he did , and went on his way , the old woman stuck the needles thickly over the lower half of her door .

the swineherd watched her flit into the shadows of the trees . and then went on his way , through the snowy woods . that he might pay with his life for the kiss that [male] had given him . sorely puzzled was [male] over the doings of [female] that day . for [female] told her not a word of what had passed between her and the swineherd .
all this time [male] was spreading out lace . and jewels , and rich brocades , and ribbons before [male] 's unwilling eyes . and taking good care to display king charming 's ring . which she wore upon her [female] , the princess recognised it as soon as her eyes fell upon it . and after that she could no longer doubt that he had indeed married [female] .
now , one day when [female] was young , and her father had gone into the forest for sudd fruit . there came limping along a most singular [male] towards the house , he was bent and shrunken . shivering and coughing , but he walked as men walk . his nut shaped head bending up out of a big red jacket , his shoulder and the top of his head were worn bare by the rubbing of the bundle he carried . and behind him came stumbling along another [male] , his servant .
the next day was a saturday , and he had to break as much ore possible and convey it . together with the piles already prepared , to the principal gallery , where the overseer of the mine would take it over . in the evening he would receive his pay . the whole of which he would take to an old woman living in the village . she looked after him , prepared his meagre repasts .
`` anything that your ladyship 's madam likes to ask , '' replied the widow , too much delighted at having the animal 's life saved to think that she was making rather a rash promise . `` very good , '' said the old [female] , and without wasting any more words she walked straight into the pig sty . then she put her hand into her pocket and drew out a tiny bottle with a liquid that looked like oil in it . she took the cork out , and dropped one of her long lady-like fingers into it .
so he began telling of this thing and that thing that never was in it at all . and when she heard that she gave him a clout that knocked his head as solid as any stone in the wall . then the second son came out , and she asked him the same question . and he told the same lies , and she gave him another clout that left his head as solid as any stone in the wall . when the king heard all that , he knew they had deceived him .
the weather was raw , moist and cold . grey and heavy ; the clouds lowered over the mountain tops like mourning veils . and enveloped the shining peaks of the rocks , the sound of the axe resounded from the depths of the forest . and the trunks of the trees rolled down the mountain . looking in the distance like slight sticks , but on approaching them they were heavy trees .
while she was thus bewailing herself , the grand vizier entered . and asked her if the fish were ready , she told him all that had occurred . which we may easily imagine astonished him ; but without speaking a word of it to the sultan he invented an excuse that satisfied him . and sending immediately for the fisherman bid him bring four more such fish . for a misfortune had befallen the others , so that they were not fit to be carried to the royal table .
and mrs. [female] settled her account with the wicked hoodies . for , as they flew away , what should they find but a nasty dead dog ? on which they all set to work , peeking and gobbling and cawing and quarrelling to their hearts ', content . but the moment afterwards , they all threw up their bills into the air . and gave one [male] ; and then turned head over heels backward .
so they went up the mountain to [male] their uncle . and [male] went up with them , and they found the giant kneeling . as he held the heavens and the earth apart , then [male] promised . and the eldest of the nymphs went down , and into a dark cavern among the cliffs . out of which came smoke and thunder , for it was one of the mouths of hell .
it happened , unfortunately , however , that stress of weather compelled them to remain a whole month at trinacria . and the store of wine and food given to them by [person] at parting being completely exhausted . they were obliged to subsist on what fish and birds the island afforded . frequently there was not sufficient to satisfy their hunger , and one evening when [person] . worn out with anxiety and fatigue , had fallen asleep , [person] persuaded the hungry men to break their vows and kill some of the sacred oxen .
when [organization] reached the ground it took its place in inclosures right up against the monumental mound . the high king sat with the four kings of erin . all wearing their golden helmets , for they wore their diadems in battle only . in an inclosure next the king 's sat the queen and the princess and all the ladies of the court . at either side of the royal pavilions were others for the dames and ladies and nobles and chiefs of different degrees .
its amber coloured waves flowed over a golden bed , and many fairies were bathing in its waves . the diamonds in their hair gleaming like sunbeams on the water . `` oh , let me bathe in the fountain , '' cried [female] . clapping her hands in delight , [female] looked . and saw beings lovelier than any her eye had ever rested on , [female] returned home .
like [male] , he falls into bad company . [male] carbury ( to whom sir [male] has unsuccessfully proposed marriage ) . falls in love with the young man , little more than a hobbledehoy who consistently gets in over his head . whatever the venture , yet it is [male] who is the only one to attempt to ask questions at the board meetings of the south central pacific and mexican railway . and he is the first to discover that [male] had been diverting its funds to such personal uses as rebuilding the longstaffe house in the country .
when the merchant opened the chest and found his third daughter in it he was beside himself with joy . the three sisters embraced each other tenderly , and the youngest divided the treasure equally . so that each one had enough to give her a rich dowry . but the evil one went on home , and by the time he reached there he was very hungry . he called to his wife to come and give him his supper .
it happened , while a son of the then [male] of argyll was prosecuting his studies in [organization] . that a dispute arose between him and one of his fellow students regarding the superiority of their respective clans . the quarrel ultimately assumed such proportions , that it was resolved to decide it by an appeal to arms . the weapons chosen were the broadsword and target . these being the common weapons of war in those days .
he is very kind and obliging to the people . sometimes driving home the sheep , or cutting and gathering the hay . if he sees a storm coming on , on one of these occasions . a farmer having expressed his displeasure with him for not having cut the grass close enough to the ground . he let him cut it himself the next year .
next morning , as dawn began to break , the side gate of the rich man 's house was stealthily opened . and a degraded looking beggar woman stepped out into the dull grey streets . and proceeded rapidly towards the open country beyond , she was as miserable a specimen of the whining . cringing beggar as could have been met with in any of the beggar camps where these unhappy outcasts of society live . she was dressed in rags which seemed to be held together only by some invisible force .
so he went in , and seated himself ; then he folded his hands . and offered up his evening prayer , and was soon fast asleep and dreaming . while the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed without , when he awoke . it was still night ; but the storm had ceased . and the moon shone in upon him through the windows .
in a third variant of the story , they are snakes which are killed by the hero .

as it was evident that the queen had no favor for her . the servants did as they pleased with her . and often treated her harshly , not one amongst them liked her . nor was it any wonder , seeing that , with every step she took from the wise woman 's house . she had grown more contemptible , for she had grown more conceited , every civil answer given her .
picking it up , he hurried back , carrying the hive in his two hands before him . when he reached the cave of the dragon . he looked in and saw the monster still crouched over the weeping child . without a moment 's hesitation , the bee man rushed into the cave and threw his hive straight into the face of the dragon . the bees , enraged by the shock , rushed out in an angry crowd and immediately fell upon the head .
he was awakened by the singing of the birds . and his heart was lighter , he saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owning to the loss of the lamp . and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it , the sultan . who was sitting in his closet , mourning for his lost daughter , happened to look up . and rubbed his eyes , for there stood the palace as before , he hastened thither .
four nights later , when all the world was asleep , the witch softly crept into the king 's chamber and took the sabre from his side as he lay sleeping . then , opening her lattice , she flew on to the terrace and dropped the sword into the river . the next morning everyone was surprised because the king did not . as usual , rise early and go off to hunt , the attendants listened at the keyhole and heard the sound of heavy breathing . but none dared enter , till [male] pushed past .
all sudden and unaccountable sounds which startle travellers in lonely spots . were attributed to pan , who possessed a frightful and most discordant voice ; hence the term panic terror . to indicate sudden fear , the athenians ascribed their victory at marathon to the alarm which he created among the persians by his terrible voice . pan was gifted with the power of prophecy . which he is said to have imparted to [male] , and he possessed a well-known and very ancient oracle in [location] .
he traveled rapidly night and day . for he had only to will or speak , and the canoe went , at length he arrived in sight of the fiery serpents . and stopped to study them , he noticed that they were of enormous length and of a bright color . that they were some distance apart , and that the flames which poured forth from the mouths reached across the pass . so he said good morning and began talking with them in a very friendly way .
so the shepherd slept , and [male] took the saddle off his horse . and laid his own saddle on it ; he fetched his shield . and buckled on his sword , and then he took his [male] . and as his hand touched it it sang loudly . [male] his mother heard the sound .

drawing nearer the castle , he saw it to be turning more rapidly than any wind blows . on the ramparts he saw archers shooting so vigorously that no armor would protect against them . there were also men blowing horns so loud that the earth appeared to tremble . and at the gates were lions , in iron chains . roaring so violently that one might fancy that the castle and the woods were ready to be uprooted .
fairies had such dexterous , ingenious methods of bringing to pass , whatever they projected . that it is not necessary to inquire by what means [male] soon found himself master of wealth to the utmost extent of his wishes . or that the plain features and awkward person of [male] were changed into the most dazzling beauty of countenance . and perfect symmetry of form , in [female] the effects of the fairy 's power were the least visible . her nature had always been so placid , that it could admit of no great increase of contentment .
he was appointed `` bellringer to the world , '' and wrote every year a short dissertation on the owl . but by this means people did not become any wiser than they had been before . it was just confirmation day , the clergyman had delivered a beautiful and touching sermon . the candidates were deeply moved by it ; it was indeed a very important day for them .
one morning when he was telling his wicked lies to a company of trusting women and children . the lion rose from the center of the eager circle and stalked away from the medicine man . `` noblesse oblige , '' he said , and they never saw each other again . i dare say the seller of the elixir and his descendants have been doing business in the same way ever since . now , the lion journeyed for many months through the kingdom without finding a trace of his family .
the king 's son , who saw five or six pearls and as many diamonds come out of her mouth . desired her to tell him how that happened , she told him the whole story . the king 's son fell in love with her . and , considering that such a gift was worth more than any marriage portion another bride could bring . conducted her to the palace of the king .
so looking about every where , he at length came to a place where certain fowlers had spread their nets in the night time to catch little birds . what pity tis , said he . `` men are only made to torment one another , or else to persecute poor animals who never do them any harm !

and now the winter months moved on , with slow and steady stride they went from mountain top to mountain top . around the circle of the sky line , the earth began to clothe itself in green . the great trees , holding out their naked arms like huge babies waiting to be dressed . were getting greener and greener , and last year 's birds sat in their branches singing this year 's songs . the early flowers shed their perfume on the breeze .

the story of [female] is retold with a few modifications . as the three [female] sisters invite [female] . not unanimously , to a little party for the rowans , which soon comes to be regarded as a ball . [female] is persuaded to attend the ball only after the fairy godmother . in the form of mrs. butler [female] .
`` i have long wanted a little girl like you ! '' said the old woman , `` you will see how well we shall get on together .

now there was a little pause , and then the dreams began to go past so fast that [female] lost count of them . at last one of the boats gilded out of the line of the rest . and over toward where [male] was standing , running up smoothly onto the gray beach . and out of it hopped a [male] , ugly little dream . with pop eyes and big hands and feet .
on the third day , he received from iron [male] a suit of black armour and a black horse . and again he caught the apple , but when he was riding off with it . the king 's attendants pursued him . and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth 's leg with the point of his sword . the youth nevertheless escaped from them , but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth 's head .

far out in the ocean , where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower . and as clear as crystal , it is very , very deep ; so deep . indeed , that no cable could fathom it : many church steeples . piled one upon another , would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above . there dwell the sea king and his subjects .
[female] took the [female] with a joy that was almost reverent . and her face dimpled with smiles as she started along the path toward home . i must now tell you something about the awgwas . that terrible race of creatures which caused our good [female] so much trouble and nearly succeeded in robbing the children of the world of their earliest and best friend . i do not like to mention the awgwas , but they are a part of this history .

and with this [male] said farewell and rode off , sir [male] went back to the court . and told [female] and the queen all these things . men marvelled who the strange young man could be , and many sought [male] and his wife to question them . but nowhere could they be found , greater still was their marvelling when , as the weeks passed . knights came and yielded themselves to king [male] .
when all had been done as they had commanded , and the place well cleansed and fresh rushes laid along the floor . the three knights sat on a bench , and the [male] hernox and the maid issyllt with them . and there was much cheer and rejoicing between them all , then the old priest called the [male] and his daughter from the room . and left the three knights together , suddenly , as they sat talking , the doors were shut and the windows were darkened . and a great wind arose with a sad sound .
when her husband , the pig , came back to his house . he was startled by what he saw , at first he could not believe his eyes . and stared at the [male] of bones , and at the little finger on the top of it . he felt that some fresh magic must be at work . and in his terror he almost turned away from the house .
when they again reached the deck they found that [female] had been right about the witch . for she had climbed to the roof of the magician 's house and was standing on the tallest chimneypot . as they looked she waved her arms . and at once a blue flame sprang from her , waving and dancing in the air . sometimes shooting to a great height , and again breaking out in all directions over the sea .

when this matter was reported to the shogun , having been convicted of disrespect of the privileges of the city . he was ordered to remove to his lesser palace at asakusa . now , although the hara kiri can not be called properly an execution , still , as it only differs from an ordinary execution in that by it the honour of the samurai is not affected . it is only a question of degree . it is a matter of ceremonial .
so she went into the cleft to see what it was . but she had scarce set her foot inside the cleft . before she fell through a trap door , deep , deep down , into a vault under ground . when she got to the bottom she went through many rooms . each finer than the other ; but in the innermost room of all .
thimble , with a sign to him , laid gravely down a little heap of nuts in the snow . and the three travellers left the old pilgrim still standing desolate and unquestionable in the snow . watching them till they were gone out of sight . coming presently after to some trees with tough , straight branches , the travellers made themselves fresh cudgels . after which , to raise their fallen spirits , they played hop pole awhile in the [male] .

on the other hand , the catholic bias appears when father columb is told that men will work anywhere to keep from starving . he only replies , `` some men will , '' implying that protestants would work anywhere because of their devotion to the flesh . but that roman catholics are under the dominion of the spirit and would perish first . we also encounter the barrister , mr . [male] . still working hard at age seventy , men who retire at age sixty .
soon after this mr. [male] had a ship ready to sail ; and as it was his custom that all his servants should be given a chance of good fortune as well as himself . he called them all into the counting house and asked them what they would send out . they all had something that they were willing to venture except poor [male] . who had neither money nor goods , and so could send nothing . for this reason he did not come into the room with the rest .

but she was interrupted by them all making a rush for the book . there was a swish and a whirr and a rustling of leaves . and an instant later the book lay upon the floor looking just like any other book . while [female] gladys strange companions had all disappeared . this story should teach [location] to think quickly and clearly upon all occasions .
meanwhile , they turned from the path , walked across the field . getting nearer and nearer to the [male] . when he finally did look up , they were right upon him . he was so dumfounded , and became so confused , he forgot that he could fly . and tried to get out of their reach by running , but the children followed .
this youngest girl was not only prettier than her sisters , but very much nicer . the two elder girls were very arrogant as a result of their wealth . they pretended to be great ladies , declining to receive the daughters of other merchants . and associating only with people of quality , every day they went off to balls and theatres . and for walks in the park , with many a gibe at their little sister .
he could feel that the hilt of the sword was beginning to fit snugly into his hand . but the giant reeled and trembled , he tried to hold his bludgeon aloft . but his hands shook so that it nearly fell , he became as pale as death . and it was quite impossible for him to meet everychild 's eye . he retreated with stumbling steps , it seemed that he would fall .
there was a navy went into [location] , when it returned , it came again . a traveller on a dusty road strewed acorns on the lea . and one took root and sprouted up , and grew into a tree , love sought its shade at evening time . to breathe its early vows ; and age was pleased , in heights of noon . to bask beneath its boughs , the dormouse loved its dangling twigs .
and there , his head close against the wondrous woman 's knees . he listened in a dreamy transport to the witchery of her voice . not quite conscious of all she was saying , but the sound was so sweet . and the touch of her hand so restful and loving . that all his life throbbed within him in unspeakable delight .
the king saw at once that it was his own queen . and immediately hewed asunder the iron chain that was fastened to the belt . this was followed by such noises and crashings down in the earth that all the king 's palace shook . so that no one expected anything else than to see every bit of it shaken to pieces . at last , however , the noises and shaking stopped , and they began to come to themselves again .
`` nothing could be [female] , '' said the fool . and the knave began to eat , and went on till he had eaten a third of the porridge . the fool , who had counted every spoonful , now took his turn . and ate precisely as much as his comrade , the knave then began again , and was exact to a mouthful . but it emptied the pot , thus the knave had twice as much as the fool .
so saying she went to the door of the tank , and spoke . and now tangle understood her perfectly , i want one of you , she said , ', the wisest . thereupon the fishes got together in the middle of the tank . with their heads forming a circle above the water . and their tails a larger circle beneath it .
all eyes were fixed on [female] , who felt a deadly chill at her heart . for [female] saw but did not know her . he cast an indifferent glance at her . then began again to talk in a tender tone to the fair haired lady . who smiled disdainfully , and behold , the bullet grew larger and larger until it became a goblet of chased gold .
the rogues were more amazed than ever ; they forgot their anger . and buying the pipe for two hundred gold pieces . they went joyfully home , not long after this one of them quarrelled with his wife . and in his rage he thrust his knife into her breast so that she fell dead on the ground . then he took [male] 's pipe and blew into it with all his might .
a very terrible old fairy found the professor out ; she felt his bumps . and cast his nativity , and took the lunars of him carefully inside and out . and so she knew what he would do as well as if she had seen it in a print book . as they say in the dear old west country ; and he did it . and so he was found out beforehand , as everybody always is ; and the old fairy will find out the naturalists some day .
in vain the old lady peered across the bank to the farther shore in the attempt to see if her little hut was still standing . but the darkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife . there was nothing left for her to do but to ask the good villagers for shelter over night . the next day , when the sun shone out . the torrent had subsided and the brook was running between its banks in a steady stream .
in great distress he looked about for someone to tell him what it all meant . and at last he found an old man thatching the roof of a cottage . this old man was so thin and grey that at first [male] took him for a patch of mist . but as he went nearer he saw that he was a human being . and , going close up to the wall and shouting with all his might , for he felt sure that such an ancient man would be deaf .
then the king and queen kissed their dear child . without waking her , and left the castle , proclamations were issued , forbidding any approach to it . but these warnings were not needed , for within a quarter of an hour there grew up all round the park so vast a quantity of trees big and small . with interlacing brambles and thorns , that neither man nor beast could penetrate them . the tops alone of the castle towers could be seen .
the next time that there was a market the boy again changed himself to a horse . and was taken thither by his father , the horse soon found a purchaser . and while the two were inside drinking the luck penny the wizard came along and saw the horse . he knew at once that it was not an ordinary one , so he also went inside . and offered the purchaser far more than he had paid for it .
meanwhile , the poor white hind fled into the wood , she wandered about till she came to a fountain . where , as in a mirror , she saw her own changed shape . and wept , convulsed with grief , then hunger began to attack her . she bent her head . and browsed upon the green grass , which she was surprised to find tasted very good .
respecting the conveyance of live rats , the rat catcher should always be particular to have good strong cages and bags . because if he had a number of rats in an unserviceable bag which happened to break open at a railway station or in the street . i think he could be summoned for the damage the escaped rats might do . still , i have not in my time had or heard of a case of this sort . speaking of bags , a good many people seem to think that if a man puts his hand into a bagful of rats they will bite him .
well , he got more -- so many , that there was a whole swarm of them . and then the brewing went on bravely , now when the sweet wort was ready , they were all eager to taste it . you may guess ; first of all the ogre , and then all his kith and kin . but shortshanks had brewed the wort so strong that they all fell down dead . one after another , like so many flies , as soon as they had tasted it .
her godmother now made her appearance . and , having touched [female] with her wand , she made her look even more magnificent than on either of the former occasions . the sisters now recognized in [female] the beautiful person they had seen at the ball . and threw themselves at her feet , to implore forgiveness for all the ill treatment they had shown her . [female] raised them up , and , embracing them .
the king , in the fear of his heart . consented , and the old woman led him to her house . where her daughter sat by the fire . she received the king as if she had expected him . and he saw that she was very beautiful ; but still she did not please him .
he continued his journey towards the north . marching onward for many days with haste and hurry . as if he were trying to get home before all were dead there ; but to no one did he speak of his longing . for no one would have believed in the sorrow of his heart . the deepest a human heart can feel , such a grief is not for the world .
meanwhile he led a merry life , he drove about in the king 's park . he went to the theater ; he gave money to the poor . because he remembered how miserable it was to have no money in his own pocket . the soldier was always gaily dressed now , he had a great many friends who said he was a real gentleman . and that pleased him very much , and so he went on day after day .
the king and queen embraced each other , and she told him the whole story how the witch came to the ship when they were all asleep and sent her off in the boat . after she had gone so far that she could not see the ship . she sailed on through darkness until she landed beside a three headed giant . the giant wished her to marry him . but she refused ; whereupon he shut her up by herself and told her she would never get free until she consented .
he kept to the path , and when the others saw this they turned round and followed him . away they went further and further , far across big moors and along narrow valleys . and at last it became lighter , and when they had got out of the forest altogether they came to a long bridge . which they had to cross , but on that bridge a bear stood on guard . he rose on his hind legs and came towards them .
but one day when the ranee came to the tank she saw [female] rajah lying on the water very still . his colours looked dull , and when she called to him he came to her slowly . and would not eat the rice she had brought to him . the ranee could refuse nothing to her dear [female] rajah . she immediately sent for masons and stone cutters .
he passed through the city with rapid steps . after ten years of absence he would still recognise every stone . and every stone was to him a stone of reproach that recalled a sin . for that reason he struck his naked feet roughly against the kerb stones of the wide street . and rejoiced to see the bloody marks of his wounded feet , leaving on his left the magnificent portico of the temple of [male] .
the prince then mounted his horse , forded the river . and was soon riding along the bank of the stream , while the water sprite gayly floated upon its dancing ripples . when the gryphoness started southward , in pursuit of the princess . she kept out of sight among the bushes by the roadside . but sped swiftly along , the absolute fool , however , mounted upon a fine horse .
next morning he bade good-bye to his sister . and rode away on his black haired steed , which overtook the wind before and outstripped the wind behind . he travelled swiftly till evening , spent the night in a forest . and the second day hurried on as he had the first , the second night he spent in a forest . and next morning as he rose from the ground he saw before him a man covered with blood from fighting .
he first draws a magical circle , of different character according to the time of the year . the order of the spirits desired , the day . the hour , and so forth , three circles about nine feet in diameter with the space of a hand 's breadth between them is one method . certain signs and written particulars being made within each circle . it is then necessary to bless and consecrate the work , and after nine days
on the third evening prince fickle was so impatient to see his fair enchantress again . that he arrived at the feast hours before it began . and never took his eyes from the door , at last [female] arrived in a dress all covered with gold and silver stars . and with a girdle of stars round her waist . and a band of stars in her hair .
in company with her male colleague . the great [location] actor , [female] , she was producing a particularly poetical and fantastic interpretation of midsummer night 's dream . in which the artistic prominence was given to [female] and [female] . or in other words to [female] and herself . set in dreamy and exquisite scenery , and moving in mystical dances .
they bade the smiths go and make a coffin of silver and of gold . mickle and stark , and brace it strongly with good steel . right heavy of their cheer were all the folk . the night was ended , they told them it was day . and the queen gave order to bear the dead knight .
the marriage between them was arranged , and the guests from far and near were invited to attend . among those asked was a dwarf who had also been a suitor for the hand of the princess . this dwarf was a very powerful magician , and as he was very malicious as well as powerful . he was greatly feared by every one , he was scarcely two feet high . and so ugly that it was enough to frighten one only to look at him .
yes , certainly , she saw it yonder in the distance . it gleamed before her , and twinkled and glittered like the evening star in the sky . she saw a glittering portal open , that led to a little garden , where all was brightness and dance music . colored lamps surrounded little lakes , in which were water plants of colored metal . from whose flowers jets of water spurted up .
on windy nights the horseman is heard dashing up to the hall . the rider dismounts , makes his way up the stairs into a room on the first landing . whence presently screams and groans issue . suddenly the horseman reappears and gallops off . the horse appearing wild with rage , its nostrils streaming fire .
directly they were satisfied that he really slept , prince [male] helped himself to the dragon 's spectacles . requesting the princess not to remove her hand , lest the slumber should not last long enough for their purpose . prince [male] had stood facing the huge beast as he transferred the spectacles to his own nose . and , naturally enough , the first thing he saw through them was the interior of the dragon 's mouth . with the tongue raised and shot forward in readiness for the hiss which sleep had intercepted .
preparations were at once made and in a few days [male] bid his parents farewell and set forth . he traveled many days and many nights over desert plains and through dense forests until he came to a high mountain . halfway up the mountain he found a house . now this house was occupied by three people : old [female] . who was a bad old witch ; her husband , who was a wizard but not so bad as [female] .
of course , the sisters tried to squeeze their feet into the slipper . but it was of no use -- they were much too large . then [female] shyly begged that she might try . how the sisters laughed with scorn when the prince knelt to fit the slipper on the cinder maid 's foot . but what was their surprise when it slipped on with the greatest ease .
all the dwarfs rushed pell mell toward the chair where the gander sat . dressed in [person] 's hat and shoes and with a veil over its face . it sat as still as a stone until they were close upon it . then up rose the great white gander with a hiss , it spread its wide strong wings . and before the dwarfs could escape it had brought them down with such a blow that three of the dwarfs were knocked head over heels .
whilst passing the street between the amphitheatre andclement 's . she was seized with violent pains , fell to the ground amidst the crowd . and , whilst her attendants ministered to her , was delivered of a son , some say the child and mother died on the spot . some that she survived but was incarcerated , some that the child was spirited away to be the [female] of the last days . a marble monument representing the papess with her baby was erected on the spot .
you may guess how angry and scratched he was before he tore his way out . so nix naught nothing and his sweetheart had time for a good start . but the magician 's daughter could not run fast because she had lost her toes on one foot ! therefore the magician in giant form soon caught them up . and he was just about to grip nix naught nothing when the magician 's daughter cried .
then there was a continual opening and shutting of doors . and at the common entrance , all day long and far into the night . there was somebody always coming in , or going out , letting in the chilling blast . that rushed through the muddy halls , and into the rooms . pinching the sick and old in a pitiless way , altogether , it was not a pleasant place to live in .
but , on looking behind him , [male] saw something that induced him first to draw the bridle . and then to turn [male] about , he made a sign . which the winged horse understood , and sunk slowly through the air . until his hoofs were scarcely more than a man 's height above the rocky bottom of the valley . in front , as far off as you could throw a stone .
plaited frames are worn by men in connection with these head feather ornaments . these frames are flat curved bands , rigid or nearly so , generally forming half or nearly half a circle of an external diameter of about nine inches . and being about one inch in width , they are worn at dances and on solemn occasions . they are placed round the top of the forehead . not vertically , but with their upper edges sloping obliquely forward , and have at their ends strings .
and , as the sun rose , [female] came and stood by the grave . gazing down upon his master through tears of grief . gazing down upon the dead through bitter tears of grief , there was no more beautiful thing in the world than the palace of the emperor of [location] . it was built of the very finest porcelain , delicate and fragile as an egg shell . the people , high and low , who dwelt in that palace moved with the utmost [male] and care lest they should break anything .
and the king sent two waiting maids and two attendants into the tower . to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table . but when she was led in she ate nothing . and said , the [female] and merciful god who has supported me in the tower . will speedily deliver me , she lived three days more .
when it was black night , the princess put on her lovely clothes and jewels . and sat on her roof , at midnight she went to her room and went to sleep . then the raja 's son sat on his bed and flew to her bed room . there he said to his bag , bag , i want a very . very beautiful ring , the bag gave him a glorious ring .
so the hag put down the sack on the road . and went aside by herself into the wood , and lay down to sleep , meantime [male] set to work and cut a hole in the sack with his knife . then he crept out and put a great root of a fir tree into the sack . and ran home to his mother , when the hag got home and saw what there was in the sack . you may fancy she was in a fine rage .
thus , after many years , did the terrible giant of the flood perish for breaking his word to father [male] . in a great and beautiful city that stood by the sea , an old man lay dying . [male] was his name , and he was the richest man in the land . propped up with pillows on a richly decorated bed in a luxurious chamber . he gazed , with tears in his eyes .
but i refer rather to the second , which represents the jew , after the lapse of ages . bowed beneath the burden of the curse , worn with unrelieved [male] . wearied with ceaseless travelling , trudging onward at the last lights of evening . when a rayless night of unabating rain is creeping on . along a sloppy path between dripping bushes ; and suddenly he comes over against a wayside crucifix .
i have seen a reproduction only , and can not speak of the color . the whole effect of the picture is attractive , for the purpose of painting the portrait of the chinese empress . [female] was assigned an apartment in the palace . it is said that the picture was to be finished in december . 1903 , and will probably be seen at thelouis exhibition , she painted in oils as well as in water colors .
as he dipped the pitcher into the water . it gladdened his very heart to see it change from gold into the same good . honest earthen vessel which it had been before he touched it . he was conscious , also , of a change within himself . a cold , hard , and heavy weight seemed to have gone out of his bosom .
would not you like a cup of tea ? ', she asked . and he said he would , when the tea came . he seemed to enjoy it so much that [male] really believed he was hungry . indeed , he admitted that he was , i have not had any luncheon , ', he said . [female] heart was touched ; she forgot that the man was strange .
at the bottom i got down on my hands and knees and crawled along . touching the side of a wall at my right . the wall ended abruptly , and feeling the ground before me i found that i was on the edge of open space . and i could hear the rushing of water far below . my hand touched the top of a [person] .
and so she helped him out , and heard how the wolf had come . and eaten all the rest , and you may think how she cried for the loss of her dear children . at last in her grief she wandered out of doors . and the youngest kid with her ; and when they came into the meadow . there they saw the wolf lying under a tree .
then , with a great hurtling and crashing , the knights ran together . and much people were there slain , the knights of sir [male] did great damage among the king 's people . for they were fierce knights , and burned to revenge themselves for the evil names they had heard . sir [male] raged like a lion through the field . seeking sir [male] , and many knights did he slay or overthrow .
to make a long story short , the smith got the quarter of a pound of gold . and the quarter of a pound of silver . and the quarter of a pound of copper . and gave them and the pattern crown to the prince . he shut the forge door at nightfall .
kintaro now rose to be the greatest hero of his country . and great was the power and honor and wealth that came to him . he now kept his promise and built a comfortable home for his old mother . who lived happily with him in the capital to the end of her days . so the prince [male] and his wife went to the temple of [male] at [male] and stayed there for a long time .
the old folks were so clever and industrious , not an hour was quietly dozed away . on sunday afternoons some book was always brought forth . particularly a book of travels , and the old man read aloud about africa . about the great forests and the elephants that were there quite wild ; and the old woman listened so attentively . and now and then took a side glance at the clay elephants , her flower pots .
but no one could find any , at last one of the hunting dogs came to the foot of the tree quite muddy . and the rajah said , look , the dog is muddy . he must have found water : follow him . and see where he goes , the attendants followed the dog . and saw him go to the stream at the mouth of the cave where the two children were .
so he jumped out of bed , and took hold of his large knife . let america see , said he , what the young rogues are about . and do the business at once , he then walked softly to the room where they all slept . and went up to the bed the boys were in , who were all asleep except [male] . he touched their heads one at a time .
when little [female] awoke she found her sheep gone . and hardly knowing what she did , she walked on and on , far into the wood . she met some people with hoes and rakes in their hands . and asked them if they had seen her sheep , but they only laughed at her . and said , no , one man was very cross , and threatened to beat her .
it was a grand thing to be able to guide a great beast like that . and another discovery he made was that , in order to guide the horse . he had in a measure to obey the horse first . if he did not yield his body to the motions of the horse 's body . he could not guide him ; he must fall off .
but the fox was comfortable where he was , and did not hurry himself to take his tail 's advice . and before very long he found he was too late , for the bear had come round by another path . and guessing where his enemy was began to scratch at the roots of the tree . the fox made himself as small as he could . but a scrap of his tail peeped out , and the bear seized it and held it tight .
in a place like an eastern bazaar , where the shops lie with wide open fronts . and with their goods displayed not only within but without on terraces and [organization] raised a few feet above the public roadway . such a long talk as that between [female] mull and the merchant could not but attract some attention from the other shop keepers in the narrow street . if the merchant had but known it , nearly every shop owner in that district was a thief . and the cleverest and biggest of all was [male] mull .
never was so much agitation , so much love , so much [female] . displayed in an interview that lasted but a few minutes , no words can express the feelings of those wretched lovers during that brief period . [female] , alarmed at finding herself in the company of [female] . almost , perhaps , in sight of the prince of the peaceful island . made a great effort to depart , and left him with a command never to see her more .
immediately the mantle rose , and hovered before the boy 's astonished eyes . bearing the little man up into the air , the old man waved farewell from his airy height . then he pointed southwards with his staff . and swift as an arrow flew the magic mantle towards his far-off home . the boy watched the wonderful journey with devoutly folded hands .
the alligator gnashed his teeth with rage . `` never mind , i will catch this little jackal yet , '' he declared , and he hid in the tall grass beside the path that led to the fig tree . he waited there for several days , but he saw nothing of his intended victim . the jackal was afraid to come to the fig tree any more , he stayed in the jungle and fed on such roots and berries as he could find there .
your majesty has subjects , proceeded he . who make a profession of loving and honouring god . and suffering great hardships for his sake ; to them i would advise you to have recourse . and engage them by alms to join their prayers with yours . it may be , some among them may be so just and agreeable to god as to obtain what they pray for .
she rang a bell that was at her bedside . and a servant entered ; but as soon as she saw beauty , the woman gave a loud shriek . upon which the merchant ran upstairs , and when he beheld his daughter he ran to her . and kissed her a hundred times , at last beauty began to remember that she had brought no clothes with her to put on . but the servant told her she had just found in the next room a large chest full of dresses .
it was vain trying to pump him ; the old landlord of the `` three nuns , '' for some reason , did not choose to tell tales of barwyke hall . if he really did , as i suspected , remember them . i paid my reckoning , and resumed my journey . well pleased with the good cheer of that old-world inn , but a little disappointed .
i think the book succeeds as comedy . not as romance , my second time through the story was through a reading by [male] . a genius of the spoken word , and his inflections bring out the comedy that the reader may not take the time to extract while merely gliding over the text . one of the serious interviews , the confrontation between doctor thorne and lady [female] . is a masterpiece , as she strives to use her position as a de courcy to separate his niece [female] thorne from her daughter [female] .
so the king understood at last what she meant . and bade his attendants put the bag also on his horse . that being done , the princess , by degrees , yielded to his wish that she should go with him . for the king was a very handsome man , and spoke so gently , and kindly , to her . but when they arrived at the palace , and the old queen .
to this mode of dealing with stammerers could anything be in stronger contrast than the brutal dieffenbach technique ? the latter exemplifies , if in an extreme form , the folly of attempting . as is so often done , even today -- to treat stammering on a basis of imperfect observation . the former shows the happy results that may be obtained when it is attacked in the light of thorough investigation , no . it is neither by the surgeon 's knife nor by the use of mechanical appliances or physiological devices that stammering is to be really conquered .
indeed it was conspicuous , it was some way below high water and the group stood out perhaps thirty yards down the beach . nobody , as mrs. [female] told my cousin [female] . knew a bit what to do and they all had even an exaggerated share of the national hatred of being seen in a puzzle . the mermaid seemed content to remain a beautiful problem clinging to [female] . and by all accounts she was a reasonable burthen for a man .
`` neither in the wood , nor in this neighborhood any more , '' said the lion . and running to the forest , soon left it with his kindred , the animals in the country . not hearing him roar any more , gathered round the goat , and said , `` the wisdom of one doth save a host. '' in the good old days a clown in the east . on a visit to a city kinsman .
now it came to pass that , at the storming of a grassy hillock of the moor . [male] was taken prisoner by the men in black-and-white . but was bravely rescued by [male] who fought his way undaunted to his side . presently the enemy yielded the disputed hill , and the company in red and white made ready to hold it for their own . the day waned ; a tide of dark and threatening cloud rose over the horizon to the east .
popopo after this found much enjoyment in visiting every millinery shop he could find and giving new life to the stuffed birds which were carelessly tossed aside as useless . and they flew to the fields and forests with songs of thanks to the good knook who had rescued them . sometimes a hunter fires his gun at a bird and then wonders why he did not hit it . but , having read this story , you will understand that the bird must have been a stuffed one from some millinery shop . which can not , of course , be killed by a gun , on one of the upper branches of the congo river lived an ancient and aristocratic family of hippopotamuses .
every day , when his work was done , he used to go up to the house . half hidden among flowering plants and brilliant creepers . where humming birds darted from [male] to [male] . and parrots of all colours , red and green and grey . shrieked in chorus , there he would find the [male] waiting for him .
as he went homeward , he passed the doom of the parents . who inquired how many fish their sons had caught and how long they would be in coming back . he told them the facts . but they would not excuse him , they dragged him before the magistrate to account for the loss of their children . he defended himself by saying he had not invited the boys to go with him .
the little old man pulled a little brown stool from under the hedge . and , standing upon it , dipped a little cup into the pitcher . then he took the cup out , full of the brown liquor . and putting it on the ground , sat down on the stool under the shadow of the pitcher . he began to put a heel piece on a bit of a boot just the size for himself .
he put on the cloak , and when he came outside it shone so bright that he could see to go with it . on reaching the river he went to take a drink like his sister . but at that moment ring and [male] sprang upon him . took the cloak from him , and threw him into the river . the old hag could stand the thirst no longer , and asked her husband to go for a drink for her .
this person , moreover , maintained that he belonged to a very old family in the land of egypt . and that he was highly esteemed there , he had just come from the field . he said , and had been put into a card house three stories high . and all made of picture cards with the figures turned inwards . there were doors and windows in the house .
when the prince heard these encouraging words he felt much comforted . rose up , and ate , and then went away gladly with his friend , on the way they met two men . these two men belonged to a family of robbers . there were eleven of them altogether , one , an elder sister . stayed at home and cooked the food , and the other ten .
they played with golden balls , and rode little horses . with silver saddles and bridles , but these pretty animals were no larger than small dogs , or grayhounds . no meat was ever seen on the table , but always plenty of milk . they never told a lie , nor used bad language , or swear words . they often talked about mortal men , but usually to despise them .
and without more words they sprang on their horses . and rode like the wind , the gate of the castle was thrown down . and they entered the court and called loudly to their sister . but the poor girl was so ill with fear and anxiety that she could not even speak . then the brothers dismounted and passed through the six open doors , till they stood before the iron one .
when he came to the big door it was locked . through one of the windows he saw a table . and supper ready on it , but he saw no person . he was very tired and hungry , but he was afraid to knock at the door of such a fine place . `` aw , that place is too gran '' for the likes of me ! ', said he .
`` give [location] each a hand and do not be afraid , '' said the elves . and whisked her across like dandelion down , the elves were very glad to see her . and touched and peeped and asked questions as if they had never had a mortal child to play with before . [female] was so small she could dance with them now . and eat what they ate , and sing their pretty songs , she found that flower honey and dewdrops were very nice .
these elaborate and highly organized efforts of the young imagination , of which boys and girls of unusual inventiveness are capable . are imitated on a smaller scale by all normal children , they endow inanimate things with life . and play and suffer with them as with their real playmates . the little girl not only talks with her dolls , but weeps with and for them when disaster overtakes them . the boy faces foes of his own making in the woods .
the judge did not give ear to all that was said ; but asked the cavalier if he suspected any body else beside me ? the cavalier told him he did not . and gave his reasons why he believed his suspicions not to be groundless . upon this the judge ordered his followers to seize me . which they presently did ; and finding the purse upon me .
`` will you kindly have [male] for a little until i try my skill ? '' with that he blew a blast that unloosed all the yards upon yards of strong . coarse netting and bore them off like puffs of [male] . [male] 's heart sank . but , strange to say , the north wind did not blow away the blossoms of the apple tree .
but it chanced that this time they were in dooros wood they kept up the feasting and dancing so long . and were so full of joy because of their victory over the lake fairies . that one little , weeny fairy , not much bigger than my finger , lost his head . and dropped a [male] in the wood , when the feast was ended the fairies went back to fairyland . and were at home for more than a week before they knew of the little fellow 's fault .
i saw a little carpet laid down like those we kneel upon when we say our prayers . and a comely young man sat upon this carpet reading the alcoran . which lay before him upon a desk , with great devotion . at the sight of this i was transported with admiration . i wondered how it came to pass that he should be the only living creature in a town where all the people were turned into stones .
then the princess hunted for the birds that death said fought for wish 's hat . and presently she heard them making a great hubbub . and , looking up , saw them in the tree top above her , fighting for the old hat . just as death said they would be doing , she picked up a stone and threw it in the midst of them . and they dropped the hat and flew away screaming , then she put on the hat and wished herself at the top of the hill .
in the church were the prince 's relations and friends . and the princess [female] 's relations and friends . and the seventeen princes and princesses , and the baby . and a crowd of the neighbours , the marriage was beautiful beyond expression . the duchess was bridesmaid , and beheld the ceremony from the pulpit where she was supported by the cushion of the desk .
lusmore , who was ever a good natured little fellow , told the woman all the particulars . how he had raised the tune for the fairies at [location] . how his hump had been removed from his shoulders , and how he had got a new suit of clothes into the bargain . the woman thanked him very much , and then went away quite happy and easy in her own mind . when she came back to her gossip 's house .
he told her , also , that his master had wearied of [male] 's [location] . his fine food and dishes , his music of shells and strings . his countless mulgar slaves , beasts , and groves and gardens . and that , having chosen three servants , [male] , [male] , and himself . he had left his brother 's valleys .
lina looked up and whined , [female] threw her the half of his loaf . which she ate , while her master and the [female] 's wife talked a little . then the [male] 's wife gave them some water . and [male] having paid for his loaf , he and [male] went up the street together . the steep street led them straight up to a large market place with butchers
thus they lived for months and months in great [female] . soon all their food was eaten up , and the men had to go hunting . but they could not kill enough game to feed such a large population . then the tsar became quite terrified , for he knew that he must starve very soon if they found no help . several times he sent messengers to the distant shore of [location] .
the crowd grinned and made slighting remarks of a personal nature . and [male] , the shopkeeper , demanded in a loud voice the money for the silk dress he had brought . then the woman whispered to her husband to run and pump some more gold while she kept the crowd quiet . and he obeyed quickly , but after a few moments he returned with a white face to tell her the pump was dry . and not a gold piece could now be coaxed from the spout .
then the jewel princess smiled , and rose up lightly , and her hair was so long that it hung to the edge and hem of her silken red robe . and she passed to where the palace steps led down into the water . and standing upon the last step she called to the fishes of the sea . and summoned them , great and small , from far and near , so the fishes of the sea . both great and small , swam about her feet , and the water was silver with their scales .
but in spite of their precautions she formed an intimacy with a young man and was presently found to be with child . when this became known the villagers held a panchayat to enquire into the matter . but the girl flatly declined to give any information and her father and brothers were unable to point out the offender . so the village elders decided to let the matter stand over till the child was born . when the birth took place the question arose in whose name its head should be shaved .
and in two or three minutes they returned to where [female] was anxiously awaiting them . [female] looking quite fresh and sweet in the half puritan like garb , with a bow of black velvet in her hair and a bunch of violets as a breast knot . but she smiled pleasantly enough as she thanked annot for her kind offices . and then the three made their way downstairs together , but a visit from cousin [female] . however sudden and unexpected , at once necessitated gala gowns ; the opening of the `` withdrawing room '' .
no one would listen to her or give her a morsel . till [female] charity rose from her seat at the foot of the lowest table . and kindly asked her to take her supper , and sleep in her bed in the back garret . again the old woman sat down without a word , [female] charity scraped the pots for her supper . and slept on the sack , in the morning the old woman was gone .
at midnight the boar came , and threw himself against the door to break it in . the needles wounded him sorely , so that when he had gained an entrance he was heated and thirsty . and went to the water jar to drink , when he thrust in his snout the crabs attacked him . clung to his bristles and pinched his ears . till he rolled over and over to disencumber himself .
this being told to sir [male] , he sent for mrs. [female] . and desired she would examine little two shoes , and see whether she was qualified for the office . this was done , and mrs. [female] made the following report in her favour . namely , that little [female] was the best scholar , and had the best head and the best heart of any one she had examined . all the country had a great opinion of mrs. [female] .
the next minute the car was rattling down the street and [female] went back into the store where [female] was still being badgered by a laughing crowd persisting in questions about the angel . as [male] caught sight of him . the obstinate expression in his dull eyes did not at first change . but in a minute something familiar in the look of the stranger impressed him . and suddenly he knew , was it you ?
by this time knops would have returned , so [female] hurried [male] off . not , however , without first filling his pockets with goodies , up they clambered . until it seemed as if they might reach the stars by going a little farther . and now [male] was really so tired that when he sank down on the feathery couch in the sea shell corridor he was asleep before he could explain to knops the cause of his absence . he must have slept a very long while -- a time quite equal to an ordinary night .
one individual , however , was daily pining away before my eyes -- my faithful [male] . who was the victim of silent self reproach , tormenting himself with the idea that he had betrayed the confidence reposed in him by a good master . in failing to recognise the individual in [male] of whom he had been sent . and with whom he had been led to believe that my melancholy fate was closely connected . still , i had nothing to accuse him with .
having reviewed the military career of [male] , i shall proceed to make two or three observations respecting his character as a ruler and citizen . we have abundant evidence to prove that he was a profound lover of his country . he loved her hills and dales . her mountains and valleys , her alpine heights and cwms . or dells , with all the strong passion of a warm and generous heart .
so on and on they went ; but the river was very wide , and the waves were boisterous . on the right brink was a thick forest of trees . with such heavy foliage that a little way off they looked like a bank . green , and smooth , and steep ; but as the light became clearer , [person] could see here and there the great stems . and see creatures like foxes , wild boars .
only she would never sleep indoors , all the children of the village loved her . they did not know how they had ever played without her . it went on so till just about this time of year . perhaps it was a little earlier , anyhow the snow was melting , and you could get about the paths . often the children went together a little way into the forest in the sunny part of the day .
the king 's people made so many inquiries for the prince . and sought him with so much care , that at length they found him at the house of roses . the queen was astonished at the great beauty of [female] . and also at that of [female] and [female] , she embraced them with as much tenderness as if they had been all her own children . and conceived an immense friendship from that moment for the good woman .
so he spoke , jesting upon the terrible subject , [male] wept harder than ever . and his other hearers shuddered , some of the people followed him afar off . but when , nearer and nearer , they heard the dragon 's roars shaking the hills . they turned about and fled back to the village , leaving [male] to go his way alone . [male] was not afraid , he strode on manfully until he came to the valley which led up the mountain where the dragon lived .
the first act of a bride on entering her new abode was to do homage to the lar . in the belief that he would exercise over her a protecting influence and shield her from evil . just as there were public lares so there were public penates , which were worshipped by the roman people under the form of two youthful warriors . who , in later times , were regarded as identical with [male] and [male] . they are generally represented on horseback , with conical caps on their heads .
it was guarded by a dragon who spouted water which dispersed in a fine mist . within the gate lay a small hornless dragon who raised his head . showed his claws , and would not let him in , the fisherman spent several days in the cave . satisfying his hunger with the green slime , which he found edible and which tasted like rice mush . at last he found a way out again , he told the district mandarin what had happened to him .
so where allfowlsness is nobody must know ; and all that is to be said about it is . that [male] waited there many days ; and as he waited . he saw a very curious sight , on the rabbit burrows on the shore there gathered hundreds and hundreds of hoodie crows . such as you see in cambridgeshire , and they made such a noise . that [male] came on shore and went up to see what was the matter .
we passed the whole day almost constantly at table . and when it was bed time , they prayed me again to make choice of one of them to keep me company . in short , madam , not to weary you with repetitions , i must tell you . that i continued a whole year among those forty ladies , and received them into my bed one after another . and during all the time of this voluptuous life , we met not with the least kind of trouble .
upon the sultan 's declaration being proclaimed , several young men appeared . pretending that they had killed the monster , and gave various accounts of the combat . which made the prince smile , by [male] ! it is strange , said the sultan , that a youth in such a perilous situation should be so unconcerned as to smile . while the sultan was ruminating on this occurrence , a eunuch entered from the haram .
[male] 's joy had been so great that now the longing for his son took deeper hold of him . and he lost strength day by day . yet [male] could not persuade him to see a physician . he often , however , inhaled deep draughts of a concoction that he had made in the laboratory with his son 's letter before him . and as he seemed to derive no benefit from it he would distil it again and mix with it new drugs .
we must now return to the little old woman , after her sons had started she gave way to the most bitter grief . while she was in this state , an old witch came up to her . and said she would help her , as she hated the giant . and wished to kill him , the old witch then took the little old lady on her broom . and they sailed off through the air , straight to the giant 's castle .
`` what did you call me , prince ? '' said [male] with a look of surprise and anger . the prince , wholly unprepared for such an outbreak , was too much terrified to answer . he saw that in [male] 's gleaming eye which told him . boy as he was , that countess [male] 's son was not to be trifled with .
pulling it out of the pot , she ran with it to her door . and gave it to a [male] who was passing , he was very thankful for it . and looked forward to having a better dinner than he had enjoyed for many a long day . but his pleasure did not last long , for , as he was getting over a stile . he happened to sneeze very hard , and [male] , who had been quite quiet inside the pudding for some time .
she wore a mask across her face . but her brow and mouth and chin were shown . the youths saluted her , and she bent her head to them . one of the women who had brought birds to the fair followed her . bringing a cage , [female] talked to this woman in a strange language .
on the way thither she saw so much of him . and found him so charming , that [female] might have married her himself had he chosen . but he would not have been false to his master for all the beauties under the sun . at length they arrived at the king 's city . and the fair one with golden locks became his spouse and queen .
he continued boasting in this manner , till at length the two kings made a wager as to which smith could execute the most skillful piece of workmanship . the smiths were sent for , and the two kings determined that each smith should make a knife . the smith related to [male] what had passed , and desired him to try whether he could make as good a knife as the lock he had made . [male] promised to do so , although his last work had not brought him much . the smith was in truth a mean man .
thereupon queen [female] rode into a valley where many great stones were . and when she saw that she must be overtaken , she shaped herself . horse and man , by enchantment . unto great marble stones , anon came sir [male] and sir [male] . but they might not know the lady from her men .
tempted by curiosity to see the sight , she opened the gate a little and peeped out . then the hero [male] , or `` great strength , '' clapping his hands and stamping his feet , with a great effort grasped and threw down the stone door . and the heroes fetched back the sun goddess . as [male] is the patron god of strength .
surely [female] , the all powerful , ruler of olympus . would have compassion on man ? but [male] looked to [male] in vain . compassion he had none . then , in infinite pity , [male] bethought himself of a power belonging to the gods alone and unshared by any living creature on the earth . `` we shall give fire to the man whom we have made , ''
great was the shout that rose from those who still lived when that [male] hunt thus came to an end . and when , with his keen blade , [male] struck off the head . even as the quivering throat drew its last agonised breath , louder still shouted the men of [male] . but not for himself did [male] despoil the body of his foe . he laid the ugly thing at the feet of atalanta .
well , now , [male] was prouder nor ten paycocks , and used to take a walk down street in the heel of the evening . but some o the little boys had no more manners than if they were [male] . and put out their tongues at [male] 's club and [male] 's goat skin . he did not like that at all , and it would be mean to give one of them a clout . at last , what should come through the town but a kind of a bellman .
the cook at first paid little heed to the dove ; but when she returned a second and a third time . and repeated the same words , he ran to the dining hall to tell the [male] thing . but no sooner did the lady hear this music than she gave orders for the dove to be instantly caught and made into a hash . so the cook went , and he managed to catch the dove . and did all that the slave had commanded , and having scalded the bird in order to pluck it .
these things , i must confess , are past my finding out ; and if heaven is not so favourable as to give some light into them . we , i fear , must both go down to the grave together , come , then . my son , continued he , let [location] go and afflict ourselves in conjunction . you for the hopes you have lost . and i for seeing you grieve , and not being in a capacity to remedy your affliction .
in a few minutes [female] was eating a hearty supper . and then he followed the little boy up to his bedroom . where they both slept soundly all night long after mother had blown out the light . old king [male] was a merry old soul . and a merry old soul was he .
gently , and with much trouble , she pushed back the bar . as silently lifted the latch , and then took up the glimmering lamp which stood in the ante chamber of the hall . it seemed as if a stronger will than her own gave her strength , she removed the iron bolt from the closed cellar door . and slipped in to the prisoner , he was slumbering , she touched him with her cold . moist hand , and as he awoke and caught sight of the hideous form .
we who go from [location] to [location] in a few hours . and cross thegothard in a day , can scarcely realize the distance that separated these capitals from the centres of italian art in the time of the renaissance . we have , however , abundant proof that the sacred fire of the love of art and letters was smouldering in [female] . [location] , and england -- and when the inspiring breath of the renaissance was wafted beyond the alps a flame burst forth which has burned clearer and brighter with succeeding centuries . from the time of [male] de beauvais .
aladdin had won the hearts of the people by his [male] bearing . he was made captain of the sultan 's armies . and won several battles for him , but remained modest and courteous as before , and lived thus in peace and content for several years . but far away in [location] the magician remembered [male] . and by his magic arts discovered that [female] .
when at last she was dressed and ready to go about her household duties she looked very fresh and sweet . as midday came , she found it hard to sit still at her wheel . but kept jumping up on any pretext whatever to run outdoors a moment to see if the young horseman was in sight . at last she did see him at a distance and . oh , how she hurried back to her stool so that he would never think that she was watching for him .
when [female] was all well at last ; he rose and donned his many colored robes that jingled when he walked . he had grown thin and pale , and they became him poorly . but he had not money to buy others . he wrapped his great cloak all about him and started out to earn his bread . poor [male] was too weak to dance ; he could not plow or dig ; he had not been so trained .
for the present we will suspend our judgment , [male] , mr. [male] . all of you , go to mr. [male] 's office . we will compare mr. [male] 's papers with our ledgers and day books. the bag was unlocked , and paper after paper was produced . and document after document submitted for inspection and comparison .
to go `` a summer harrying '' was the usual employment of the true viking , and in the winter only could he enjoy domestic life and the pleasures of the family circle . the rapturous fight with the elements , in which the northman lived and moved and had his being . gave him a strain of ruthless cruelty unlike anything in the more peaceful anglo saxon character . his disregard of death for himself led to a certain callousness with regard to human life . and to a certain enjoyment in inflicting physical [male] , there was an element of red indian ruthlessness in the viking .
and [female] bought the thrall , and they all went home to lithend together . when [male] heard that [male] would not sell to [male] . he was very wroth and rode up into the hills with all his sons . and took meat from his storehouses and bound it upon five horses . and hay from his barns and bound it upon ten horses .
while he was entertaining me with an account of this barbarous custom . the very hearing of which frightened me cruelly , his kindred , friends and neighbours came in a body to assist at the funerals . they put on the corpse the woman 's richest apparel . as if it had been her wedding day , and dressed her with all her jewels . then they put her into an open coffin .
molly 's father left the old home and went afar , nowadays , by the railroad . it takes but some few hours , but in those times over a day and night . to travel so far east as to weimar , both [female] and [female] cried , and she told him he was more to her than all the fine folk in weimar could be . a year passed by -- two , three years -- and only two letters came . the first sent by a letter carrier , the other by a traveler -- a long and devious way by town and hamlet .
even my father began to fidget now , and to wonder where the expected guest could be . and my mother became positively uneasy , if there was one thing rather than another about which our uncle was particular . it was the important point of being in time for dinner . the reason he always gave for this particularity was his sense of the unfairness to the cook which was occasioned by unpunctuality . no cook , he said , could contend against it .
it is not hard to believe that pretty soon he became the richest and jolliest farmer in all that country-side . sleek and fat he grew , and his heart was bigger and kinder than ever . but what like was [male] 's heart when he got wind of all this ? ay , there 's the question , [male] turned green with envy . as green as grass , `` i will have a fairy mallet , too , ''
and to the stern king his home seemed more desolate and sad . for he missed the warm light , the happy flowers . and , more than all , the gay voice and bright face of little violet . so he wandered through his dreary palace , wondering how he had been content to live before without sunlight and love . and little violet was mourned as dead in fairy land , and many tears were shed .
in this fashion day followed day . and still beauty found plenty to amuse her , at the end of a week she made the most wonderful discovery of all . there was one large room which she had entered but once , because it seemed to her rather dull . and dark too , it was empty ; and although it had four windows in each wall . but two of them admitted any light , one day , as she passed the door .
there was no mistaking the voice of the skriker for that of anything else upon earth . and , with a sickly feeling at his heart , [male] slowly emerged from the gloom . and , in expectation of the appearance of the ghastly figure , passed on . he had not to wait long , for as he reached the old bridge spanning the hodder . once more he saw , in the centre of the road .
the bear , the deer , the monkey and the [male] looked at him to see what he would do now . [male] went from one tree to another that grew along the river bank . at last he stopped in front of a very large tree that was growing at the water 's edge . he took hold of the trunk and pulled it with all his might . once , twice , thrice , at the third pull , so great was [male] 's strength that the roots gave way .
but all the time they never guessed the real reason why [female] chose to live in the [organization] stone . i will tell you why he did so . not very far from the stone there was a curious hill , shaped exactly like a wart . it was known as the wart hill of hoy . and men said that somewhere in the side of it was hidden a wonderful carbuncle .
there are plenty of children , and they can consume abundance of food . they rush out of the houses , and throng about the travellers . come they on foot or in carriage . the whole horde of children traffic . the little ones offer prettily carved wooden houses , for sale .
her letters written to the countess [female] at this time are added to her `` souvenirs , '' and reveal the very best of her nature , feeling the need of continued repose . she bought a house at louveciennes . where she spent much time , in 1818 m. le brun died . and six years later the deaths of her daughter and her brother left her with no near relative in the world .
the cow house door opened and in came a whole lot of little men . dressed in green coats and leather caps , keeking through the straw . he saw their horns hung by their sides . their whips in their hands , and scores of little dogs of every colour . green , blue , yellow , scarlet , and every colour you can think of .
prince [male] heard a loud noise and looked back . there was his sister chasing him , so he waved his handkerchief . and a deep lake lay behind him , while the witch was swimming across the water . prince [female] got a long way ahead . but on she came faster than ever ; and now she was close at hand !
but he was at length startled from his waking dream by a swell in the noise outside . all the time there had been a few of the more idle of the inhabitants about the door . but they had been rather quiet , now , however , the sounds of feet and voices began to grow . and grew so rapidly that it was plain a multitude was gathering , for the people of [male] always gave themselves an hour of pleasure after their second breakfast . and what greater pleasure could they have than to see a stranger abused by the officers of justice ?
what of the [location] senator ? in [female] we find the prototype of the ugly american . described in the novel that gave the phrase to our political vocabulary . as pretentious , loud , and ostentatious -- changed , in some way , when they leave their native land . senator [male] 's sins in [location] are a bit different . loud , yes , lacking in tact , yes , convinced of the superiority of [location] ways , yes .
[female] lived on the coast of the county [male] . [male] was a fisherman , as his father and his grandfather before him had been . like them , too , he lived all alone , and just in the same spot , too . people used to wonder why the [male] family were so fond of that wild situation . so far away from all human kind , and in the midst of huge scattered rocks .
they gathered fruit and flowers for each of their guests . entertained them with the most exquisite music , disclosed to them many secrets of futurity . and invited them to stay as long as they should find their situation agreeable . but the island was secret , and nothing of its produce must be carried away . the whole of this scene was invisible to those who stood without the margin of the lake .
he settled down again to wait and listen , but he did not hear anything . he kept waiting , when he got tired of waiting down under the road in the culvert . he climbed up and hid in a bush by the side of the road . [male] waited some more , but still nobody came walking down the road . the sun was right overhead , he was hot and tired and hungry and lots of things .
the next morning there was a great buzzing in the palace . you may be sure , the princess told all about how she had been carried away during the night . and had supped in such a splendid palace , and with such a handsome man dressed like an emperor . she showed her necklace of diamonds . and the king and his prime minister could not look at it or wonder at it enough .
this caused her to be discovered , and the sun child told how she had come and found him . now as they had partaken of bread together , they had become friends . and agreed to solve the difficulty in a friendly manner , they decided to roast salt meat and make the bride eat it . without letting her drink , each was to take a pitcher of water . and they all were to go riding in the fields , he whom she should ask for a drink must be her husband .
after which the bride drinks once from the third cup and hands it to her father in law . who drinks thrice from it ; the bride again drinks twice from it . and after her the mother in law drinks thrice . the parents in law and the bride thus have drunk in all nine times . if there are any brothers or sisters in law .
ant. , then would you to the galleys , at east . ere lady that you close in sleep those eyes that i would die to view . think , think on mine that watch and weep . and on my heart that breaks for you , the sun does not disdain to turn . and on the meanest weed to shine , that scorch would up dies .
then the paper boat fell to pieces . and the soldier sank into the water and immediately afterwards was swallowed up by a great fish . oh how dark it was inside the fish , a great deal darker than in the tunnel . and narrower too , but the tin soldier continued firm . and lay at full length shouldering his musket .
the youth , who had now lost every trace of languid feeling . took a great interest in the matter , and early the next morning started off to tell the junior sorcerer that the bee man had discovered what he had been transformed from . and desired to be changed back to it , the junior sorcerer and his learned masters were filled with delight when they heard this report . and they at once set out for the mother 's cottage . and there by magic arts the bee man was changed back into a baby .
meanwhile the dragon came on , half flying and half on foot . such haste did he make , never was seen upon the earth so terrible a beast . he looked like to a mountain as he came . so much of the earth did he cover , so high did he rear himself in air . so broad a shadow did he cast , he was covered all over with scales as of brass or iron .
the ka was represented as a human being following after the man ; it was born at the same time as the man . but it persisted after death and lived in and about the tomb . it could act and visit other kas after death . but it could not resist the least touch of physical force . it was always represented by two upraised arms , the acting parts of the person .
then [female] slipped the little sack into his pocket . and set out for the overturned stone cross where the three roads meet . when he had come to the place , he looked here and there . and this way and that , but for a long time he could see nothing at all . at last , after much looking , he beheld a little black beetle running hither and thither on the stone .
the old man was lost in bewilderment by all that had happened , he hardly knew for some time where he was . when he came to understand what had happened to him , he was delighted to find that the lump on his face . which had for so many years disfigured him , had really been taken away without any pain to himself . he put up his hand to feel if any scar remained . but found that his right cheek was as smooth as his left , the sun had long set .
we look down upon a crowded amphitheatre , out of the `` clouds '' of aristophanes . satire and humour are pouring down in streams upon the audience . on the stage [male] , the most remarkable man in athens . he who had been the shield and defence of the people against the thirty tyrants . is held up mentally and bodily to ridicule -- [male] , who saved [male] and [male] in the turmoil of battle .
it is true that in the iliad we frequently see her on the battlefield fighting valiantly . and protecting her favourite heroes ; but this is always at the command of [female] . who even supplies her with arms for the purpose . as it is supposed that she possessed none of her own . a marked feature in the representations of this deity is the agis .
at another shop , she took capers . cucumbers , and other herbs preserved in [female] . at another she bought pistachios , walnuts , small nuts . almonds , kernels of pine apples . and other fruits ; and of another she bought all sorts of confections .
lelsing put the ashes of his house into sacks and . loading them on his donkey , set out to sell them . as he found no buyers , he rested for the night under a tree by the road side . presently a band of merchants with well loaded pack bullocks came to the place . you must not camp here called out [male] to them i have two sacks of gold coin here and you may take an opportunity to steal them .
the woman loved him still so much , she wish d for nought instead ; yet did she pine , each night to go all supperless to bed . scarce had they spoke when on the hearth appear d a little [female] : so beautiful she was , the room it shone as bright as day . then waving thrice her [female] hand , in silver tones she spake .
i was going to say , forgetting that it was , if not fairyland itself . just at the entrance to it , it did not seem a very large garden . or rather one could not quite tell how far it extended , for at the farther end it sloped down rather suddenly and beyond . a great thicket of beautiful trees and bushes gave a misty . vague appearance , through which [female] only caught sight of gleams of sky and [female] .
when the lad saw that , he was not long getting down from the tree and in throwing the bridle over its head . and then it was so tame you could hold it with a pack thread . and what do you think -- that horse was dappled , too , and so like [male] . you could not tell which was which , then the lad bestrode the new [male] he had won . and rode home to the palace , and old [male] ran loose by his side .
having bound his eyes with a handkerchief , she took him to the room where the body lay . pulled off the bandage , and bade him sew the quarters together . after which she covered his eyes again and led him home . then they buried [male] , and [male] his slave followed him to the grave . weeping and tearing her hair , while [female] 's wife stayed at home uttering lamentable cries .
the sunlight of a new summer was making its way into the ocean realm when [female] came out of the palace and walked through the gleaming water meadows . the fairy had been called to a distance by some business in a remote part of her extensive kingdom . and [female] had thus been left alone in the castle , but the splendid halls seemed to him only half as beautiful without their lovely queen . and he determined to seek the society of the merry fishes without . they came swimming to meet him , slipped through his fingers .
and know that the sorrow of sorrows is only a law of his being . the tired leaves were falling always thicker ; the days were shorter . night came down with the rapidity of a swooping bird . and more than once in the early morn a white frost had covered the ground like crystallized sugar strewn all over the earth , the gypsies camp was still pitched beside the wood , they had work to do in the villages close by .
when the hares were all together , the hareherd drove them home . the king was waiting for him at the gate . let each in singly , counting till he reached a hundred , -- not one missing from the round number . but all to no use , for when the king had reached home . and was just putting his hand on the latch to open the gate .
together they ran into [female] 's room . and there she lay in her little white bed , with her eyes closed and her curls spread out over the pillow . and when they came in she smiled in her sleep . the dream shook the bubbles above the bed . and the [female] came into [female] 's cheeks , oh !
rosette now unpacked her trunk . her heart was beating and swelling tumultuously , sighing heavily , she drew out her robe of coarse cloth and the other articles of her toilette . [female] was very adroit , she arranged her exquisite blonde hair most beautifully . with a pullet 's feather and a band made of burrs . her head dress was indeed so charming that it made her a hundred times more lovely .
and the man dreamed that he was on the dust heap , scratching , and when he woke , behold ! that also was no dream , but the truth , once upon a time an old man and his wife lived together in a little village . they might have been happy if only the old woman had had the sense to hold her tongue at proper times . but anything which might happen indoors , or any bit of news which her husband might bring in when he had been anywhere . had to be told at once to the whole village , and these tales were repeated and altered till it often happened that much mischief was made .
a young man having gone early one morning to a barn to feed oxen . when he had done , lay down on the hay to rest , as he lay he heard the sound of music approaching the barn . and presently came in a large company , wearing striped clothes , and commenced dancing to their music . he lay quite still , thinking to escape their notice ; but a woman . better dressed than the others , came up to him with a striped cushion .
the sun was shining when he awoke , and he jumped up and ran to the pot . the plant had disappeared and in its stead was a thick syrup . just as the book had said there would be , he lifted the syrup out with a spoon . and after spreading it in the sun till it was partly dry . poured it into a small flask of crystal .
she stopped underneath the tree where the [female] dwelt and . gathering some dry sticks , kindled a fire , next , she placed the tripod over it . and the kettle on top , but something was the matter with the kettle . as fast as the old woman put it where it was to stand . that kettle was sure to roll off , falling to the ground with a crash .
while he was yet a child , his parents removed from marbach . and went to reside in another town ; but their dearest friends remained behind at marbach . and therefore sometimes the mother and her son would start on a fine day to pay a visit to the little town . the boy was at this time about six years old . and already knew a great many stories out of the bible , and several religious psalms .
the four friends liked the place so well that they would not leave it . and so far as i know , they are there to this day . what does little birdie say , in her nest at peep of day ? let me fly , says little birdie , mother , let me fly away . birdie , rest a little longer , till the little wings are stronger , so she rests a little longer .
i noticed after a while that the princess . my wife , began to respond to my constant [female] more carelessly ; at times she would sit and look at me wonderingly . i knew not why , one day she asked me to accompany her on a little excursion in the city . she did not tell me where she meant to go . but i asked nothing ; it was enough to be with her .
forlorn as they were , they however kept a good heart . and making use of every chance , in course of time they all acquired a knowledge of hunting and the pursuit of game . the eldest became expert in the craft of the forest , and he was very successful in procuring food . he was noted for his skill in killing buffalo . elk , and moose ; and he instructed his brothers .
etienne and she were wed one summer morning . but the little new moon had not shone in the heavens a second time when there was trouble between them . marguerite 's tongue was sharper than ever from its long rest . and [male] could not believe it belonged to his `` angel '' bride . he left the cottage without a word .
for flowers , blackberries , and bilberries were to be found in profusion . so large and sweet that when they were crushed beneath the tread of passers-by the heather was stained with their red juice . here was a barrow and yonder another , then columns of smoke rose into the still air . it was a heath fire . they told him -- how brightly it blazed in the dark evening !
`` mamma , mamma , '' and the wolf only caught her little [female] . thereupon , oh dear , oh dear , he draws back . crying and shaking his jaw as if he had swallowed red hot coals . it was the little fire coloured [male] that had burnt his tongue right down his throat . the little [male] , you see , was one of those magic caps that they used to have in former times .
`` i am not warm , '' said the figure ; and that was quite true . and yet she was not a stone now which reminded one of a woman . but a woman that reminded one of a stone , all the west was very red with the sunset . and the river was red too , and [male] distinctly saw some of the coils of rope glide down from the trees and slip into the water . next he saw the stones that had looked like sheep raise up their heads in the twilight .
but you see it was love that made poor [male] admire them all so much . and , above all , he was charmed when they smiled , ah , how little do brothers and sisters know how tender their recollections of each others faces would become , were a separation to take place among them ! then all the sweet smiles and pretty looks would be recalled , that in every day life are seen with such indifference . `` little children , love one another , '' during the happy days when you live together in health and comfort .
the wind carried tidings of these things to other [location] . and brought back messages of praise and good-will from other rulers . glad to know that the experiment worked so well , this made a deep impression on the golden rods and their friends . for they could not deny that violet had succeeded better than any one dared to hope . and the proud flowers began to see that they would have to give in , own they were wrong .
[male] at once agreed to meet [male] at midnight within the ruins of the priory . and he kept his word , it was a stormy night . great clouds being hurried across the face of the moon . and the woods were bending and moaning in the fierce blast , [male] marched up and down while he waited for the german . shouldering his pike staff , and dreaming that he was back again on the outposts with a dozen hostile riflemen hidden in front of him .
all the others in the room were silent , gazing now at the sleeping beauty . and now at everychild , and just at that moment there were evidences of new life in the adjoining apartments . you could hear some one playing on a spinnet . a sentry on a distant wall called the hour . lords and ladies could be heard laughing together , and then there was a great to do .
to complete his misfortune , as he went by the judge 's house . he would needs know the cause of the tumult . the curriers told him , that they saw him come in that condition from the gate of the apartments of the grand vizier 's women . which opened into their street ; upon which the judge ordered [male] to have a hundred blows with a cane on the soles of his feet . and sent him out of the town with orders never to return .
the animals turned to look , and saw their master , the old enchanter . he had been worried by their long absence and had gone forth to look for them . thus , at the same moment that the poor dog saw that he had been pursuing his friend . the cat saw that he had been escaping from his comrade . suddenly a noise from the castle arrested their attention .
when the queen saw that all her charms were unavailing , she mounted her horse and started in pursuit of the lad . but let [location] return to the lad . he passed all the dangerous places and came to the square where the road divided into the three branches . he saw the monk waiting for him . `` here is the fairy nightingale , holy father , ''
from the place where the bodies of the dead boys lay . two large bamboos grew up , when the bamboos had grown very big , a jogi came by that way and cut them down . making from them two flutes , these flutes produced such beautiful music that every one was charmed and the fame of the jogi spread far and wide . so when in his wanderings the jogi reached the kingdom of the [male] raja the raja sent for him and the jogi came to the palace with his two [male] flutes . when the flutes were brought into the presence of the raja they burst open and from them appeared the two boys .
the night was holding out steadily so far , was it he . [male] , who had awakened , or some other ? he was not very clear . strange alike looked the happiness behind , and the hope before him . he was not sure of himself in that twilight of his senses . it seemed scarcely believable his title to either gift of heaven to memory or to expectation .
a day came when the young farmer was found drowned in a pool at the bottom of a forsaken mine . and the frightened horse was still grazing near the mouth of the pit into which his master had fallen . the woman he had betrayed and left to die a shameful death . having assumed the shape of a white [male] , had haunted the perjured and false hearted farmer to his death . it is said that fatal accidents in mines are often foreshadowed by the appearance of a white [male] or rabbit .
one day , when the king had gone out , and when nobody was about . the bad woman took the queen by the head . and her daughter took her by the heels , and dragged her out of bed . and threw her out of the window into a stream that flowed beneath it . then the old woman put her ugly daughter in the bed .
`` lords , for [female] 's sake help poor [female] out of prison ! '' now the sheriff happened to be only five miles away , and soon heard the news of this disturbance . and how [male] and [male] had broken the king 's peace . and , as his duty was , he determined to arrest the law breakers . twenty-four of his best men were sent to the castle to gain admittance and arrest [male] and his steward .
the [female] of the old castle of sleat . once the residence of the lords of the isles . was often seen at dusk standing near the [female] stone . where her allowance of milk was placed , her appearance was that of a young woman with long hair . the [female] that haunted old breacacha castle .
but [male] climbed down from the tree and went on home . and after that he lived very happily in the lady 's house and was like a son to her . just as she had promised him , once upon a time there was a poor widow who had only one son . and he was so dear to her that no one could have been dearer , all the same she was obliged to send him out into the world to seek his fortune . for they were so very poor that as long as he stayed at home they were like to starve .
[male] drew and defended himself , and soon contrived to slash [male] on the forehead . so that the latter , seeing himself overmatched , fled under the cover of the night . [male] , fearing to hurt his recently healed wound , did not give chase . and went quietly back to [male] 's house , when [male] returned home . he hatched a story to deceive [male] as to the cause of the wound on his forehead .
`` how can i deliver you , '' said their sister , and they went on talking to each other nearly all night . they only dozed for a few hours , [female] was awakened in the morning by the rustling of the swans wings above her ; her brothers were again transformed , and were wheeling round in great circles till she lost sight of them in the distance . one of them , the youngest , stayed behind , he laid his head against her bosom . and she caressed it with her fingers .
so they went to the castle where they had both endured so much . but when they reached it , it was difficult to believe that it was the same . for it had all been rebuilt and done up again , and there they lived for a hundred years . a hundred years of joy and happiness . there was once upon a time a man who understood all sorts of arts .
`` let them enter , '' said the [male] , in a quiet , firm voice . he had heard but one name ; his plan had proved successful . for he had counted upon [male] being one of the chosen delegates . the old man approached a few paces nearer , and in simple , but eloquent language . pleaded that the jews should be permitted to remain unmolested in mayence in which city their community had been long established .
soon , in front of the broad path along which they were traveling . there rose up before him a glorious palace , it had a splendid gateway . and the silver topped towers seemed to touch the blue sky , `` what building is this ? '' asked the lad of his two guides , they made answer that it was the palace of the king of fairyland . then they led him into the throne room .
the [female] remained with them , the heroes respected and loved her . and considered her as their own sister , the way was . they used to go hunting , and she was always at home . took care of the housekeeping , cooked for them . washed for them , now a [female] , boneleg , began to come to the hut and suck the blood of the merchant 's daughter .
so he began to believe in the wisdom of his teacher . then he went on his way and on the road he turned aside to a tank to bathe . and remembering the maxim of his teacher he did not bathe at the common place but went to a place apart . then having eaten his lunch he continued his journey . but he had not gone far when he found that he had left his purse behind .
mary is a credible heroine , she likes to have fun . and she is a bit indiscreet with her friend [female] . whom she unwittingly encourages to the point that he falls in love with her after she has become lady [male] . and the author , who tells [location] a lot . never tells [location] so in so many words , but she surely loves him .
on finally reaching [location] , as i have already related , i found that my good mother had gone to her reward more than a year before . i have also told how , later , the treachery of a relative landed me in a madhouse . where i remained for twenty eight years -- seemingly unending years . and , still later , after my release , how i returned to the life of a fisherman . following it sedulously for twenty seven years , then how i came to [location] .
although the door opened very quietly , she heard the sound . and looked up , and when she saw the handsome young prince standing in the doorway . she started toward him , and cried in great distress . `` o boy , boy , why have you come here ? '' the prince told her he had come to serve the giant .
so [female] climbed and scrambled , and slipped and clung . till he found himself on the margin of a wonderful green lake . which was but the opening into the whole eye of the cockatrice . and as soon as [male] looked , he had lost his heart for ever to the world he saw there . it was there , quite real before him : a whole world full of living and moving things .
the empress had been a spectator of the scene . and she could not but admire the quickness of the ambitious eiko . and in order to pacify the rivals she determined to appoint them both to the generalship of the front army . with these words [male] seized an iron [male] and mounted a black horse . and rushed forth like an angry [male] to meet his two foes .
just peer into a clear pool or stream , almost any bright day . and you will be pretty sure to see one of them looking up at you . they are the sauciest and most mischievous of all fairies , only stare at them a little . and they will mock you to your face with smiles and pouts . and will not go away as long as you stay , for they have no fear of you or any earth people .
he was not long in making the discovery , for the sides of the mountain came closer together until finally there was but a narrow path between them . along which [female] and her party were forced to pass in single file . they now heard a low and deep `` thump , -- thump ! , thump ! '' which echoed throughout the valley and seemed to grow louder as they advanced . then , turning a corner of rock , they saw before them a huge form .
like a sylph she flew into the stove to the tin soldier . became , all at once , flame , and was gone , the tin soldier melted to a little lump . and when the servant , the next day , was carrying out the ashes . she found him like a little tin heart . of the dancing lady , on the contrary , there was nothing but the ground on which she had stood .
the pride of [female] had never before experienced so severe a wound . her consequence was lessened in her own eyes , and she felt that it would be so in those of others . by the desertion of such a lover , for she had sense enough to discern the superiority of [female] over all her other admirers . she could appreciate his worth , but she could not controul her own too long indulged inclinations . and was still too artless to conceal the wrong bias they had taken , the disappointment had a visible effect upon her temper .
slowly they went at first , and the goat herds who tended their flocks on the slopes of mount [female] looked up in fear when they saw the dark shadows of their wings and marked the monster birds making their way out to sea . from the river beds the waterfowl arose from the reeds . and with great outcry flew with all their swiftness to escape them . and down by the seashore the mariners hearts sank within them as they watched . believing that a sight so strange must be a portent of disaster .
therefore , one night when the early season of spring made his longing strong in him . he took the key from the princess while she slept . and opened the little closet in which hung the four feather coats . and when he saw his own , all at once he remembered the great pools of water . and how they lay in the shine and shadow of the moonlight .
so off they set for the blue bird 's nest ; and , to make a long story short . the prince stole two of the eggs , and would not give them back . till the bird promised to tell him all it knew . and the end of it was , that the bird carried him to the court of the queen of mushroom land . she was sitting , in her crown , on a mushroom .
when , upon the occasion of the public adoption of his son . [male] gave a grand banquet , the old servant of [male] contrived to mix a strong poison in the wine of the unsuspecting [male] . but the youth -- according to the pious custom of the ancients . of offering a libation to the gods before partaking of any repast . poured upon the ground a portion of the wine before putting it to his lips .
thereupon he applauded the wisdom of his teacher . for if he had bathed at the common bathing place someone would have seen the purse and have taken it away . when evening came on he turned into a village and asked the headman to let him sleep in his verandah . and there was already one other traveller sleeping there and in the morning it was found that the traveller had died in his sleep . then the headman consulted the villagers and they decided that there was nothing to be done but to throw away the body .
[female] usually fell asleep right after she had had her breakfast . when she woke up crowing , the squirrels were playing all around her . she even learned to watch the spiders , spinning their houses of silk . without being afraid , when [female] grew up , she always called this curious creature . that could make silk , spin head , she jokingly called it her lover .
best of it all was that their good luck had come to stay , the children gave up their flutes . trombones , trumpets , bugles , fifes . horns , oboes , cornets , bassoons . and piccolos , because they had decided not to be musicians . but mill blowers instead , -- which was a blow to music .
so ever after that [female] 's words and [female] 's bitter smile haunted [female] by day and night . [male] 's grandsire , [male] the teuton . had been a man of cruel violence , the legend said that a curse rested upon him . and that at certain times he was possessed of an evil spirit that wreaked its fury on mankind . but [male] had been dead full many years , and there was naught to mind the world of him save the legend and a cunning wrought spear which he had from brunehilde , the witch .
and he dropped the trout into the lake . but no sooner had it touched the waters than it was changed into a beautiful , milk white swan . and [male] could hardly believe his eyes , as he saw it sailing across the lake . until it was lost in the sedges growing by the shore . all that night he lay awake .
there was , once upon a time , a king and queen who died young . and left a very fine empire to the princess , their only daughter . who was then but thirteen years of age , she imagined that she knew how to reign . and all her good subjects persuaded themselves into the same idea . without well knowing why : however , it is a profession which is not without its difficulties .
thereupon he stalked out , slamming the door behind him . the walls shook , and the windows shivered in their frames . a vast sheet of [location] cloud was slowly spreading over the western expanse of the sky . through its silvery meshes the full moon looked down upon the glacier with a grave unconcern . drifts of cold white mist hovered here and there over the surface of the ice .
there is no limit really to the resources of astral clairvoyance in investigations concerning the past history of the earth . whether we are concerned with the events that have befallen the human race in prehistoric epochs . or with the growth of the planet itself through geological periods which antedated the advent of man . or with more recent events , current narrations of which have been distorted by careless or perverse historians . the memory of nature is infallibly accurate and inexhaustibly minute .
one day she left her house very early . without having put anything in order , and without having done her usual household work . when she came home in the evening . she found all clean , and in the best order ; she was very much astonished . and could not imagine how it came to pass ; and it happened thus on several days .
and where were [female] 's children all this while ? why , in the island of bambini , where they had playfellows to their hearts content , and plenty of fairies to take care of them all . but out of all the seven princes and princesses whom the queen had seen carried off through the window . there was only [female] who was good and obedient ; the other six were so rude and quarrelsome that they could get no one to play with them .
one hot summer 's day a fox was strolling through an orchard till he came to a bunch of grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch . `` just the thing to quench my thirst , '' quoth he . drawing back a few paces , he took a run and a jump . and just missed the bunch , turning round again with a one , two , three , he jumped up . but with no greater success , again and again he tried after the tempting morsel .
when the grand vizier had done searching the vessel , she sailed . and as soon as [male] was got out to sea , he ordered prince [male] to be taken out of the chest and fettered . to prevent him from throwing himself into the sea . since he knew he was going to be sacrificed , the wind was favourable for two or three days . after which it proved contrary , and there arose a furious storm , which drove the vessel so far out of her course .
his ears covered the whole sides of his head . his jaws were as large around as a bushel basket . at first , after he had entered the room , he did not perceive either father time or the masked lady . he dropped one end of his bludgeon to the floor with a thump . and there he stood leering at everychild with a sinister and triumphant expression .
now [female] terassu , the glory of heaven . lay in the rock cavern . and the bright light streamed from her fair body in rays . so that she was as a great jewel of price . and pools of water gleamed in the floor of the cavern .
being in such a condition , i could not travel far at a time . i retired to remote places while it was day . and travelled as far by night as my strength would allow me . at last i arrived in the dominions of the king my uncle . and came to his capital , i gave him a long detail of the tragical cause of my return .
and then about the slumbering palace the fairy made up spring a wood so heavy and dense that never could enter a living thing . and there for a century the princess lay in a trance so deep that neither the roar of winds nor thunder could rouse her from her sleep . felt in his heart a strange wish for exploring the thorny and briery place . and , lo , a path through the deepest thicket opened before his face ! on , on he went , till he spied a terrace .
them , and laughed , and cried for joy , and kissed them again . you may be sure the old nurse was out among the foremost . her face quite shining with pleasure , and using longer words than the noblest there . and she admired the prince very much , and was delighted that `` her girl , '' as she called the princess , had got such a good husband .
but as diamond took him , he woke up and began to laugh . for he was indeed one of the merriest children , and no wonder . for he was as plump as a plum pudding , and had never had an ache or a pain that lasted more than five minutes at a time . diamond sat down with him and began to sing to him . when diamond 's rhymes grew scarce .
he called [male] , the son of [male] . because he never returned home without achieving the adventure of which he went in [male] . he was the best of footmen and the best of knights . he was nephew to [male] , the son of his sister . and his cousin , and [male] called menw .
the merchant could not refuse the summons , which every mussulmaun is bound to observe . or be declared a rebel against religion ; but said , with all my heart . we shall soon see who is in the wrong , the merchant made the same defence he had done before the merchants his neighbours . offering to make oath that he never had the money he was accused of . and that he did not so much as know there was such a sum ; upon which the cauzee took his oath .
the walls were usually light in tone , paneled , with graceful ornamentation . and often there were niches containing wall fountains of delightful design . the sideboards were either large side tables , or a species of side table built in niches . with a fountain between them which was used as a wine cooler . these fountains where cupids and dolphins disported themselves would be a most attractive feature to copy in some of our rooms .
the hour of midnight was striking from all the belfries . when a great clatter sounded down below in the courtyard , horses neighed . and men ran about , the princess leaned more forward , and listened , then a horseman . whose jewels sparkled in the moonlight , looked up and kissed a hand to her . and she kissed hers to him .
a love of nature was in her soul . a perception of the beauty of the world . she , with her poet 's spirit . saw all the green and leafy places of the earth , all its flowery ways . while they , may be , were trodden heedlessly by those about her with their gift of sight .
then the birds came curiously , dropping from their straight course , to wonder at the white wings that went not on . and they came and settled about this great , bird like thing , so still and so grand . the birds , none of them understood him . but they put their heads on one side and looked down on him in a friendly way . seeming to consider , he ran down below and fetched up a pannikin of water and some biscuit .
the fishermen , pretending to commiserate their condition , replied that they had no provisions to spare . and left only more convinced that [female] 's suspicions were well founded , matters remained in this state for a few days . the craft lying quietly at anchor , and her six hands . being , it was said , the full complement of her crew . sneaking about in all directions , in pairs , on pretence of searching for provisions .
the evil one looked , and she had the flowers upon her bosom . and they were as fresh as when he had given them to her . then he believed her , and he could not do enough to show how delighted he was with her . he showered gifts upon her . and there was nothing she might not have had for the asking .
at a round table in the room two little pigs were already eating their dinner . `` what is your name ? '' asked mrs. [female] in a kindly tone . pushing a chair up next to hers for [male] . [male] in boots , junior , madam , he replied , with a polite bow , `` this is wiggie and this is tiggie , ''
there is also in the tale an elfin old woman . the [female] of the red stream , who is of the same class with the old wife of [female] . she has a wonderful deer , which she can restore to life if she can get any of its flesh as juice to taste . and her yells split the iron hoops the prudent fin had put round his men 's heads in anticipation of her outcries . big [male] , of ardchyle , in the east of the island of mull .
after he had gone the merchant meditated upon what had been said , and he finally determined to follow the stranger 's advice and to take such goods as he had left to [male] . and place them on sale there , this he did and found that . as the stranger had promised , the prices he could get there were much higher than those paid in mecca . while [male] was in [male] he made the acquaintance of some people who were about to journey down into [location] by caravan . they urged [male] to join them .
if you were to take three hoops , the second half as large round as the first . and the third half as large round as the second , and lay them on the floor one inside the other . you would have a ground plan of the house in which [person] lived . the outermost wall was built of brick , and had five narrow windows . the middle wall was of stone , and had also five windows .
when they left the water their strange disguise dropped from them . and they were now as they had been before , a plain seal catcher and a tall . well-dressed gentleman in riding clothes , `` get up behind me , '' said the latter , as he swung himself into his saddle . the seal catcher did as he was bid .
but before they had gone very far , the fox , who was near the edge . contrived to slip over , and when the laplander saw him stretched out on the snow he pulled up his reindeer and put the fox into one of the other sledges that was fastened behind . for it was market day at the nearest town , and the man had much to sell . they drove on a little further , when some noise in the forest made the man turn his head . just in time to see the fox fall with a heavy thump on to the frozen snow .
you sleepy little mortals , high up in a balloon . you soon will pass the portals , beyond the crescent moon . then shadowland will come in view , a dream within a dream . so keep in your sleep while we keep up the steam . while the midnight hours are all a creep , and we are all a beam .
early one [male] morning , a grey morning . with snow in the air , he and his spearmen set out . riding down through the forest , and so into liddes dale , when they came back again . there were great rejoicings at [male] , they drove most of their own cows before them . and a great many other cows that they had not lost ; cows of the english farmers .
the porter did as he was commanded ; the bitch that he held in his hand began to cry . and , turning towards [female] , held her head up in a begging posture . but [female] , having no regard to the sad countenance of the bitch . which would have moved pity , nor her cries that sounded through ail the house . whipped her with the [female] till she was out of breath .
and now i ll mount my steed again and say an our father before i go , once upon a time there was a great emperor and an empress . both were young and beautiful , and as they would fain have been blessed with offspring they went to all the wise men and all the wise women and bade them read the stars to see if they would have children or not . but all in vain , at last the emperor heard that in a certain village . hard by , dwelt a wiser old man than all the rest .
mr. [male] stopped to see what he was pointing at . just a little way up the hill was a stone bridge over the stream bed . mr. [male] stared at it . the bridge looked just like a picture out of a story book . it was a low , wide , stone arch crossing over the stream .
accordingly , the next day , while bathing in the ganges , i made it appear as if i were accidentally carried out of my depth and drawn in by one of the eddies of the river . and screamed out loudly for help , my cries and screams and subsequent disappearance caused a great commotion . and long search was made for my body ; but of course in vain . for i had dived under , and come to the surface unobserved among the thick bushes at the place which had been agreed upon . there , having gone on shore , i soon found the old brahman , who was waiting for me with a suit of men 's clothes .
gerda kissed his cheeks and they grew rosy . she kissed his eyes and they shone like hers . she kissed his hands and his feet . and he became well and strong , the snow queen might come home whenever she liked . his order of release was written there in shining letters of ice .
what a journey that was : it was like taking fresh breath out of the cold dungeon air into the warm [male] . the heather bloomed in pride and beauty . and the shepherd boy sat on a barrow and blew his pipe . which he had carved for himself out of a sheep bone . [male] , the beautiful aerial phenomenon of the wilderness .
so she walked and she walked and she walked . till she arrived at a house built of straw . and she knocked at the door , and asked if they wanted a servant . the [female] said she did , and if the girl was willing she might stay . but day by day the poor [female] grew more and more sad .
the two children wandered off , as it were , into a dream for a time . and when they gazed again , the garden was more delightful than ever -- a joyous blend of spring and summer seemed to invade the grounds . while many of the flowers and trees showed slight signs of autumn tinting . in one corner of the garden a magnificent marble and bronze fountain unexpectedly sprang up through the ground and played unceasingly to the ethereal skies . [person] danced and played around its base , and lovers young and old promenaded affectionately up and down the innumerable groves .
a great many changes happen in a hundred years , the king . who never had a second child , died , and his throne passed into another royal family . so entirely was the story of the poor princess forgotten . that when the reigning king 's son , being one day out hunting and stopped in the chase by this [male] wood . inquired what wood it was and what were those towers which he saw appearing out of the midst of it .
many years afterwards the monks were fond of planting the [male] in their beautiful gardens . not only did it teach them a lesson of faith and trust . but its sweet white blossoms were regarded as an emblem of purity . and poets have always loved to sing the praises of this , the earliest flower of spring . now as he grew to manhood [male] became more and more beautiful , and each woodland fairy or water nymph would gladly have become his bride .
it was [female] 's birthday . flowers , books , letters , and visiting cards came pouring in . the general 's lady kissed her on the mouth . and the general kissed her on the forehead ; they were affectionate parents . and they and [female] had to receive grand visitors .
but as it had been in the air , so it was in the sea ! when the queen of the ocean fairies saw butterfly 's dirty brown wings . she and all her court waved their wands and disappeared . and butterfly was left alone in the sea palace , the sounds drew nearer and nearer . and a hundred fairies , standing in beautiful shells , came floating through the water .
it seemed as if the end had come , the ice pressure was terrific . and while we were not caught in the dangerous part of the jam . and were safe for the time being , yet the heaving and rending of tons of ice as it fell splashing here and there into the watery depths filled [location] with shaking fear . finally , to our great joy , the grinding of the ice ceased . and within a few hours the great mass slowly divided , and , as if an act of providence had been performed .
just as the sun sank the prince and his followers crossed the drawbridge and entered the courtyard gate . instantly the drawbridge lifted and the gate clanged shut . they went through the courtyard and the prince put his horse in the stable . where he found a place all in readiness . then the four of them marched boldly into the castle , everywhere -- in the courtyard .
the lady was now re assured : she uncovered her head . and told the knight she would accept him as her dru . if she were satisfied that he believed in god . on this head , he assures her . i in the créator believe , who did from [male] [location] relieve .
livid as he was , he spoke with a sort of prim decision . so that the mob fell silent in the middle of his third sentence . two men were instantly found in the crowd itself to offer their services to colonel [male] . who came out presently , satisfied , one was the common soldier with the coffee . who said simply : `` i will act for you , sir , i am the duc de valognes. ''
this is the end of that which hath come down to us , of the history of the city of brass , entire . and god is all knowing , in a town in [location] . there lived two brothers , one named [male] , the other [male] . their father left them scarcely anything . but as he had divided his little property equally between them .
the adventurers gave no heed to the path they followed after leaving the cave of the reformed thieves . but their horses accidentally took the direction of the foot hills that led into the wild interior kingdom of [person] . therefore the travelers , when they had finished their conversation and begun to look about them . found themselves in a rugged , mountainous country that was wholly unlike the green plains of heg they had left behind . now , as i have before said , the most curious and fearful of the island people dwelt in this kingdom of [person] .
for their sake sorrowed women not a few , [male] and [male] and [male] . the fierce warriors , quenched the flash of many helmets with blood . [male] , also , did wonders , the danes proved their mettle . and loud were heard the hurtling of shields and the clash of sharp swords swung mightily . the saxons , bold in strife , made havoc enow .
as soon as he and the princess were alone together he emptied the milk all over her . then he caught hold of her and began laying on the switch for dear life . it was well for him that he was a brave fellow and had been to the wars . for , instead of the princess , he held a great black cat that glared at him with her fiery eyes . and growled and spat like anything , but that did no good .
but the puffed up rooster stalked proudly along , followed by all the fowls , and went merrily on and on till he reached the old man 's house and began to crow , [male] ! when the old man heard the rooster 's voice he ran out joyfully to meet the bird . but looking through the door what did he see ? his rooster had become a terrible object . an elephant beside it would have seemed like a [male] . and following behind came countless flocks of birds , each one more beautiful and brilliant than the other .
after two or three days , i perceived a ship just come out of the harbour . making for the place where i was , i made a sign with the linen of my turban . and called to the crew as loud as i could , they heard me . and sent a boat to bring me on board . when they asked by what misfortune i came thither .
then nothing remained but the sandals , and because [male] was well rested by then . he was allowed to help at them , they were cut from the strip of brown leather . and [male] showed [male] how to shape them and sew them himself . so after supper he stood attired , all in brown . a pale , happy child , ready for his first party .
a man and his wife and two little children were living long ago on the shores of a lake surrounded by large trees . deep in the canadian forest , they lived very happily together , and as game was plentiful . they wanted for nothing , as the children grew up they became each day more beautiful and [male] . until the old women of the tribe said , they are too good and lovely for this world . their home is surely elsewhere in the west , before they grew to maturity a cruel plague spread over the land and carried them off with its ravages .
so at the dead of night the damsel opened his door . and with the keys that she had stolen , she opened twelve other locks that stood between them and the postern door . then she brought him to his armour . which she had hidden in a bush , and she led forth his horse . and he mounted with much joy , and took the maid with him .
`` i half suspected it was enchanted , '' murmured the wizard to himself . and he fetched his books and searched them . and found that instead of being a parrot , the bird was really a king who had fallen under the wrath of a magician . and that magician the man whom the wizard hated most in the world . eagerly he read on , seeking for some means of breaking the enchantment .
once on the other side he sped up the mountain and over the top into the next valley . where , he stopped and began to look about him , the giant [male] was lying on the sofa in his sitting room . waiting for his wife to prepare the dinner ; and he had nearly fallen asleep when the sound of [male] 's music fell on his ear . this was so unusual in his valley that the giant arose and went to the front door to see what caused it . `` that is my name , '' replied the giant , grinning at the small size of his visitor .
now , the green enchantress was very beautiful indeed , she sat all day long at the foot of an old lime tree in the royal forest . and she was dressed all in green , and she had small white hands and great black eyes and quantities and quantities of dark red hair . every animal in the forest , from the largest wild boar down to the smallest baby rabbit . was a friend of hers ; and it made her dreadfully unhappy when she saw them being killed just to amuse the king . so it was no wonder that she made up her mind .
while the stories were being told , [male] had noticed a little dried up man . sitting at a table near the story lady . and writing rapidly with an immense quill pen , before him was a pile of white paper and an inkwell . as she told the story he wrote it down . keeping even pace with her words , [female] had never seen any one write so fast and she watched him , fascinated .
the day following he sent the female superintendant of his haram with a package . containing a most superb dress , and many inestimable jewels , to the sultana . requesting her acceptance of them , and that she would allow him to see her either at the palace or at his own house . my mother , when the old woman was admitted into her apartments . received her with kindness , supposing that she must be intrusted with some confidential message from the vizier respecting the affairs of her husband .
thus did he pass those hours which are devoted to rest , and was in these mournful meditations when he heard somebody knock at the garden door . he ran hastily to open it , half dressed as he was . and had no sooner done it , than the captain and his seaman took hold of him . and carried him by force to the boat . and so on ship board ; when they set sail immediately , and made the best of their way to the isle of ebene .
there was wonderful commotion amongst the animals as [male] entered . [male] , the apocryphal , shook his apology for a tail as vigorously as that diminished appendage was capable of accomplishing . while [female] urged her claims upon his attention by rubbing herself against his legs . [female] said nothing , now , [male] perfectly well knew his delinquency . indeed , the song he had just executed , in a good , bold voice .
no sooner had he reached the grapevine than , crack ! went his legs , the poor marionette was caught in a trap set there by a farmer for some weasels which came every night to steal his chickens . [male] is caught by a farmer , who uses him as a watchdog for his chicken coop . [male] , as you may well imagine , began to scream and weep and beg . but all was of no use , for no houses were to be seen and not a soul passed by on the road .
it was got by a young lad under the following circumstances . the youth was apprenticed to the miller at bearachan on lochawe side . his master was unkind , and made him work more than he was fit for . one night he was up late finishing a piece of work . about midnight a gentleman , whom he did not recognize .
and so , as they walked homeward , they discouraged each other . and made darker the clouds that obscured their whole horizon . `` good evening , '' was at last said , hurriedly ; and the two men passed into their homes . mr. [male] entered the room . where his wife and children were gathered , and without speaking to any one , seated himself in a chair .
meanwhile the dragon soared high into the air , holding the cradle between his teeth . and the baby still slept on , he flew so fast that he soon crossed the borders of another kingdom . and again he beheld the king and queen of the country seated in the garden with a little girl lying in a wonderful cradle of white satin and lace . swooping down from behind as he had done before , he was just about to seize the cradle . when the king jumped up and dealt him such a blow with his golden staff that the dragon not only started back .
[female] still stops behind , cried [male] . out of the strength of his love , so they began to walk round the hut . but they marched round much oftener than three times , and each time they stopped at the same place . this made them very much afraid , and they held the faster to one another . only [male] dared look out to see how their captain got on .
poor old king , `` let her alone , '' he said . `` you will fare as badly as all the others , come , i will show you . '' then he led him out into the princess 's pleasure gardens . and there he saw a frightful sight , on every tree hung three or four king 's sons who had wooed the princess . but had not been able to guess the riddles she gave them .
[female] knew something of chess . and he stepped in and watched them for a few minutes . `` as soon as they look up , i can ask them if i may chop down a tree , '' he said to himself , but they did not look up . and by and by [male] got so interested in the game that he put down his axe and sat on the floor to watch it better .
scheich [female] sung , and the [female] was the more surprised . because till that moment he never knew of his drinking wine . but always took him for a grave , solid man . as he seemed to be to outward appearance , the [male] retired from the door with the same caution as he had made his approaches to it . and coming to the grand vizier , who was standing on the steps a little lower .
so [male] thanked father time , and at noon . twelve o'clock placed him behind him on the white charger . and hurried away , so fast they flew that [male] , who was holding the [male] casket close against his heart . was in great danger of falling off , when they got to the seashore . the white horse hesitated not an instant , but set foot upon the water .

`` 'ting ting , '' and the little iron chandelier suddenly rose at least half a yard and disappeared in the tub . and that was the sign that the play was going to begin , a young nobleman and his lady . who happened to be passing through the little town , were present at the performance . and consequently the house was crowded , but under the chandelier was a vacant space like a little crater . not a single soul sat there , for the tallow was dropping , drip , drip !
and to know that i must be stopped , come what will , to know that i am no match for this individual energy and keenness . or this organised and steady system , come across the street , here , and , entering by a little shop and yard . examine these intricate passages and doors , contrived for escape . flapping and counter flapping , like the lids of the conjurer 's boxes . but what avail they ? who gets in by a nod , and shows their secret working to us , [person] field .

the sultans then requested that he would send for them . upon which , their father dispatched a messenger to summon them to his presence . they repaired to the camp , mounted on chargers richly caparisoned . and most splendidly dressed , on their entering the tent , the princesses , who were seated in a recess concealed from view by blinds of gold wire . gazed eagerly at them ; and she who had lost her bird inquired of the other two if either of them was their husband .

everychild was in a high state of excitement as he and [male] made their way back to where the other members of the band awaited them . he had scarcely dared to hope that [male] would be able to get away from his mother so easily . she had seemed really terrible , but now there was little danger of her overtaking them and making her son go back . he was just thinking that the band was now large enough , even if no other children appeared to go with them . when something occurred to [male] his perfect happiness .

it was autumn now , and the greenwood was not what it had been . the birds had flown elsewhere to be the guests of the storks during the winter months . the rose had run away to be the bride of the south wind , and the [female] had wedded the brook and was taking a bridal tour to the seaside watering places . but the violet still lingered in the greenwood , and kept her vigil at the grave of the [female] . she was pale and drooping , but still she watched and sang over the spot where her love lay buried .
but [male] does not wish to hurt them , he is very fond of children and only wants them to be quiet that he may tell them pretty stories . and he knows they never are quiet until they are in bed and asleep . [male] seats himself upon the bed as soon as they are asleep . he is nicely dressed ; his coat is made of silken stuff . it is impossible to say of what color , for it changes from green to red and from red to blue as he turns from side to side .
now because little two eyes looked just like other people , her mother and sisters could not endure her . they said to her , you are not better than common folks . with your two eyes ; you do not belong to us . so they pushed her about , and threw all their old clothes to her for her to wear . and gave her only the pieces that were left to eat , and did everything that they could to make her miserable .

while they were eating , [female] from time to time turned to the cat and said to her . `` my pretty [female] , pray take care that those rags do not slip through our fingers . '' then the cat answered , `` be quiet , be quiet ; do not be talking of these beggarly things . '' the king , wishing to know the subject of their talk . the cat made answer that [male] had taken a fancy to a small lemon .
however , they obtained little comfort from the witch . who bade them `` seek their father 's wits in the place where he had lost them . '' against the wishes of the chief ministers . [male] and [male] rode off to the mysterious castle where the king had slept when his terrible fate had overtaken him . and , once inside the gates , nothing more was heard of them .
passing into her inner room , she lay down on her bed . with her eyes closed , but sleep did not come , dawn broadened into day . and the austere countenances of the icons seemed to be bent fixedly on poor [female] as she lay . deprived of strength , she made a movement and her hand touched the old newspapers in which the preserves sent by the general 's wife had been wrapped . hardly knowing what she did , she unfolded one of them .
they came to the forest children 's little moss village . the youngest forest child of all was the only one up so early , he was busily breaking dead twigs from bushes to build his morning fire and making up a little rhymeless song about [male] 's birthday as he worked . this is her birthday , spring 's little daughter . spring 's little daughter -- this is her birthday . wake now , wake now , all you forest children .
now while [male] was still a lad , but a tall , stout one , a great misfortune fell upon the kingdom . for a stoorworm rose up out of the sea ; and of all stoorworms it was the greatest and the worst . for this reason it was called the meester stoorworm . its length stretched half around the world . its one eye was as red as fire , and its breath was so poisonous that whatever it breathed upon was withered .
on the following day there was a clear frost , and very soon came the spring . the sun shone ; the young green leaves burst forth . the swallows built their nests ; windows were opened . and the children sat once more in the garden on the roof . high above all the other rooms , the children sat once more in the garden on the roof ...
after this he used to come every night and sit and talk with them . but still each day , to their great sorrow , he died . nor could they divine any means for getting back his [male] har . which the [female] wore round her neck , at last one evening . when they were all laughing and chatting together , seven peris flew into the room unobserved by them .
the bird flutters round us . swift as light , beauteous in color , charming in song , when a mother sits by her infant 's cradle . he stands on the pillow , and , with his wings . forms a glory around the infant 's head . he flies through the chamber of content .
he took a comb and combed the bangs down the foreheads of the baboons . he went to the cupboard and spread bread and butter . he took the hats out of the left hands of the baboons and put the hats on their heads . he put a piece of bread and butter in the hand of each baboon . after that he snipped each one across the nose with his finger .
i must needs confess , continued [male] . that this is a violent way of proceeding , to alarm an old father with the death of his son . whom he loved so passionately ; but then , on the other hand , the news of your welfare . which he may soon have , will in a great measure alleviate his grief . and make amends for your absence , brave [male] .
people may have heard of the renowned adventures of [female] . but how few are there who know that the cause of all his perils , above and below . was neither more nor less than his having slept under the walls of the [male] 's tower . i knew the man well , he lived at the bottom of hungry hill . just at the right hand side of the road as you go towards bantry .
but while [male] the third lay and stared up at the sky till his eyes filled with tears . the man from paradise place took his horse and jumped on its back and rode off both with it and the cart and horse . when the hoofs thundered along the road , [male] the third jumped up . but he was so taken aback when he found the man had gone off with his horse that he had not the sense to run after him till it was too late . he was rather down in the mouth when he got home to his [female] .
it is not my intention to attempt a discussion of the theogony of the deities nor the cosmogony of the world . my simple duty is to enlighten the world concerning a heretofore unknown portion of the universe . as it was seen and described by [organization] , [person] jansen . interest in northern research is international , eleven nations are engaged in . or have contributed to , the perilous work of trying to solve earth 's one remaining cosmological mystery .
old king [male] did not forget the donkey that had been his constant companion for so long . he had a golden saddle made for him . with a saddle cloth broidered in gold and silver , and the bridle was studded with diamonds and precious stones . all taken from the king 's treasury , and when he rode out . the old fat king always bestrode the donkey , while his courtiers rode on either side of him upon their prancing chargers .
then quite suddenly [male] knew what he had to do , he made up an example for himself . this was it , when he had worked it the answer was one . very quickly he opened his desk again , and there was the arithmetic fairy . looking more lovely than ever in a rich gown of indices , lined with surds . that fell to her feet in osculating curves , in her hand .
passing all the other lodges he came to his own door . where he found the magic arrow , as he had been promised . he heard his brothers within at high words with each other . they were quarrelling for the possession of his wife . who had remained constant through all his absence , and sadly awaited his return , [male] listened in shame and sorrow .
but a sound in the forest that thickly clothed the cliff made both look up . and down between the trees , almost from the height of the cliff . climbed [male] the red hunter , bow in hand . he strode across the little space that divided them still . and stood over the rusty knight and the white hart royal , and both might have been petrified .
somewhere in that vicinity lived a monstrous bear -- a great hulking obnoxious beast who had no more soul than tail . this rascal had somehow conceived a notion that the appointed function of his existence was the extermination of the dwarf . if you met the latter you might rely with cheerful confidence upon seeing the ferocious brute in eager pursuit of him in less than a minute . no sooner would [male] fairly accost you . looking timidly over his shoulder the while , than the raging savage would leap out of some contiguous jungle and make after him like a locomotive engine too late for the train .
and why live ? the schopenhauers , the hartmanns , and all the buddhists . say that the greatest happiness is [female] , non life ; and they are right in this sense . that human happiness is coincident with the annihilation of `` self . '' only they do not express themselves well , they say that humanity should annihilate itself to avoid its sufferings . that its object should be to destroy itself , now the object of humanity can not be to avoid sufferings by annihilation .
the next i heard was a heavy fall . [female] had knocked my big husband down , i pushed open the door . [female] , cool and collected , was pulling on her gloves . [female] was struggling to his feet , [male] , of course . got his divorce six months after i deserted him .
the [male] had remarked quite well that the men were afraid of the fox . but he had not noticed that the fox had borrowed the terror he inspired from him . note : this universally known fable is traditionally narrated , animal fables are very rare in [location] . that the fox borrowed the terror he inspired from the [male] is more than a simile . but that the [male] has his decoy is something we read about in the story books .
and the fairy led him into a large hall of white transparent lilies . the yellow stamens in each formed a little golden harp which echoed the sound of strings and flutes . lovely girls , slender and lissom , dressed in floating gauze . which revealed their exquisite limbs , glided in the dance , and sang of the joy of living . that they would never die -- and that the garden of paradise would bloom for ever .
on and on , beneath the dewy darkness , they fled swiftly down the swirling stream . underneath black walls , and temples , and the castles of the princes of the east . past sluice mouths , and fragrant gardens , and groves of all strange fruits . past marshes where fat kine lay sleeping . and long beds of whispering reeds ; till they heard the merry music of the surge upon the bar .
it was therefore with pleased surprise that i at length descried a human being . it was at an ironmonger 's , where there hung a paper of pins . a handkerchief and two tea pots in the window . there i saw a solitary shop boy , standing quite still , but leaning over the counter and looking out of the open door . he certainly wrote in his journal , if he had one .
replied the slave , `` who can help laughing to see an old fool offering to exchange fine new lamps for old ones ? '' another slave , hearing this , said , `` there is an old one on the cornice there which he can have . '' now this was the magic lamp , which [male] had left there , as he could not take it out hunting with him . the princess , not knowing its value , laughingly bade the slave take it and make the exchange . she went and said to the magician : `` give me a new lamp for this . ''
it is said that when the king rode out on horseback he often took [male] with him . and if a shower came on he used to creep into his majesty 's waistcoat pocket . where he slept till the rain was over , king [male] one day asked [male] about his parents . wishing to know if they were as small as he was , and whether they were well off . [male] told the king that his father and mother were as tall as anybody about the court .
for there stood [female] , right on the top of [male] 's bald pate . he was not afraid any longer ; but raised his white toboggan [male] , and shouted . `` hurrah for you , longlip , '' the bronze man struck the ground hard with his stick . but the boy never learned what he had intended to do for now the sun ran up . and , at the same time , both the bronze man and the wooden man vanished .
when he arrived he was duly welcomed and after some conversation he told his daughter that he must return the same day . she said `` all right , but wait till it gets hot . '' ( the father understood this to be a metaphorical way of saying `` wait till the dinner is cooked . '' ) but the daughter was determined not to cook the rice while her father was there . so they sat talking and when the sun was high the daughter went into the yard and felt the ground with her foot and finding it scorching she said now father .
the hora were also the deities of the fast fleeting hours . and thus presided over the smaller , as well as the larger divisions of time . in this capacity they assist every morning in yoking the celestial horses to the glorious chariot of the sun . which they again help to unyoke when he sinks to rest , in their original conception they were personifications of the clouds . and are described as opening and closing the gates of heaven .
a good deed is never lost , he who sows courtesy reaps benefit . and he who gathers kindness gathers love . pleasure bestowed on a grateful mind was never barren , but always brings a good recompense . and that is the moral of the story i am going to tell you . away went the stupid [male] , hanging down his head as if he was going to gaol .
the soldier now put on the coat , and dipped his hands into the pockets . to assure himself of the reality of the transaction . then he hung the [male] around himself . and went about the world chuckling at his good luck , and buying whatever suited his fancy which money could purchase . for the first year his appearance was not very remarkable , but in the second he began to look quite a monster .
the king , greatly enraged , said daughter , you are mad . and i must treat you as such , in a word . he had her shut up in a single apartment of one of his palaces . and allowed her only ten old women to wait upon her and keep her company . the chief of whom had been her nurse , and in order that the kings his neighbours .
of course , with all these advantages , her parents expected her to make a brilliant marriage . and , as she grew up , they began to look round for a suitable husband . but here a difficulty arose , the father was a rat from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail . outside as well as in , and desired that his daughter should wed among her own people . she had no lack of lovers .
this palace stood on the borders of a great forest . on the other side of which was fairy land , but there was only one window in the palace that looked out upon the forest . and that was the round window of the room in which princess [female] . prince [male] , and prince [male] slept . and since this window was never open except at night , after the three children had been put to bed .
in the royal city of bavaria , many years after the [organization] had been removed from the tower and melted down . some metal was required for a monument in honor of one of the most celebrated characters which a german people or a german land could produce . and now we see how wonderfully things are ordered , strange things sometimes happen in this world . in denmark , in one of those green islands where the foliage of the beech woods rustles in the wind . and where many huns graves may be seen , was another poor boy born .
too late , and what was worse , as she sprang down , she slipped . and fell some six feet , with her head on a sharp rock . and lay quite still , the professor picked her up , and tried to waken her . and called to her , and cried over her , for he loved her very much . but she would not waken at all , so he took her up in his arms and carried her to her governess .
the histories of sir [male] 's most popular characters condensed into short stories . and thus adapted as an interesting introduction to the [male] classics . so worthily considered a part of the education of every up to date boy and girl . these tales are admirably illustrated with numerous drawings in colour and black and white . printed on rough art paper , 12 full page colour plates , 144 pp .
the king had already been married once , and had by his first wife seven children . six boys and one girl , whom he loved more than anything in the world . and now , because he was afraid that their stepmother might not treat them well and might do them harm . he put them in a lonely castle that stood in the middle of a wood . it lay so hidden , and the way to it was so hard to find .
but as they went through the deep alleys of the garden that led down to the shore they came to a sight more wonderful than anything they had yet seen . before them , facing toward the sea , stood two great reindeer . their high horns reaching to the overhead boughs ; and behind them lay a sledge . long and with deep sides like the sides of a ship . all blue they seemed in that strange light , there too , but nearer to hand .
it was a very draggled and dishevelled [female] that appeared next morning at the stable door of his old home in the country . hey , diddle , diddle ! the cat and the fiddle . the cow jumped over the moon , the little dog laughed to see such sport . and the dish ran away with the spoon , once upon a time in a large white farm house upon an open moor there lived a wizard . as you know , wizards work very hard ; and about once a year .
`` he has a key , '' explained their clerical friend . `` he 's only gone into one of these garden doors , '' and as he spoke they heard one of the dull wooden doors close again with a click in front of them . [male] strode up to the door thus shut almost in his face . and stood in front of it for a moment .
no one appeared to disturb this first fairy sleep of our little heroine . and she slumbered calmly on with her new companions . slowly the sun rose over the forest , tinging the leaves with his golden rays . and warming all creation into life as he lighted up the world with his glorious lamp . then the sounds in the forest became more and more frequent , from every thicket birds carolled forth their joyous songs .
my uncle went first , and i followed him . when we reached the bottom of the stairs we stepped into a sort of ante room . filled with such a dense smoke that it was hardly possible to see anything . however , we passed through the smoke into a large chamber . which at first seemed quite empty , the room was brilliantly lighted , and in another moment we perceived a sort of platform at one end .
when they finally put her down beside the dimple holder . very rumpled and bright eyed and flushed , [female] felt her little heart swell with pride . for twice that day she had been acclaimed a heroine . once because she had tamed a caterpillar , and once because she was older than the snoodle . something told [female] , the next morning .
but at length the end was in sight , and the hardships were forgotten in the vision of the towers of the king 's palace . and , one bright morning , the cavalcade entered the gates with all the pomp and circumstance of a royal embassy . and surely no ambassador had ever created such a sensation , door and windows . even the roofs of houses , were filled with people . whose cheers reached the ears of the king .
the confidant added to what she had related before to the jeweller . that it was proper he should go immediately and acquaint the prince with the whole affair . that he might be prepared for every event , and keep faithful to the common cause . she went away in haste , without staying for any answer . what answer could the jeweller have made in the condition he was in ?
then the four laughed heartily together and ran across the barn again , up the [male] . around the hay mountain and dropped down the hole . they did that dozens of times until they were tired of it . then they played hide-and-go-seek in the hay country . and after that blind man 's [male] in the barn below .
an edict issued at val [organization] on the 11th of march . 1344 , increased the number of members of parliament . which from that time consisted of three presidents , fifteen clerical councillors . fifteen lay councillors , twenty-four clergymen and sixteen laymen of the court of inquiry . and five clergymen and sixteen laymen of the court of petitions .
once upon a time this king , according to custom . invited the sovereigns of the neighbouring lands to a great shooting party . and also their chief men , it was in the height of summer . just at the beginning of the dog days , in the early morning . when they were driving out on to the pasture the sheep with the silken fleece .
in fact , they were up to all kinds of mischief . and [female] knew that she had got into a house of pixies . but she said nothing to nobody . and as soon as the lady was well enough to mind the baby , she asked the old fellow to take her back home . so he came round to the door with the coal black horse with eyes of fire .
he snatched it and bade the slave take her choice . amid the jeers of the crowd , little he cared . but left off crying his lamps , and went out of the city gates to a lonely place . where he remained till nightfall , when he pulled out the lamp and rubbed it . the genie appeared , and at the magician 's command carried him .
the `` most beautiful woman in the world '' was now very ugly , and happened by chance to reach the palace where the pretty queen lived . her daughter wept over her , and had her kept in a beautiful room . every day showing her through a glass door her beautiful children . the poor lunatic wept and tortured herself till one day she jumped out of the window and broke her neck . the young king loved his beautiful wife as a dove does its mate .
the princess would not give him leave to go on , but cried out , alas , you bring me the deplorable news of my son 's death ! at which words she and her women set up such a hideous outcry . as soon brought fresh tears into the jeweller 's eyes . she thus tormented and grieved herself a long while before the [female] messenger was allowed to go on . at length , however , she gave a truce to her sighs and groans .
now a beautiful story is soon told , but the acts of which it is the sum pass more slowly . after many adventures of little importance he reached the capital of a kingdom by the sea . and there obtained the post of under gardener at the royal palace . with good food and wages , in his prosperity he did not forget his unhappy sister . for he felt very uneasy about her , when he had a few moments to himself he would sit down in some retired spot and gaze upon her portrait with a sad heart and eyes filled with tears .
the queen looked around , but saw no one , pressing the burden to her heart . she started homewards , she dared not look at the little one . but she felt the tiny arms clasped confidingly round her neck . and the sweet mouth pressed against her cheek gave her more happiness than she had ever known . the sea followed her , washing the shore with phosphorescent waves to light her steps homewards .
when all was ready , [female] visited once more each favorite spot -- the hill top whence he had been used to see the rising sun . the stream where he had sported as a boy . the old lodge , now looking sad and solemn . which he was to sit in no more ; and last of all , coming to the magic circle . he gazed widely around him with tearful eyes .
half of the flesh and half of the spirit is pan . there are some who have never come into contact with him , who know him only as the emblem of paganism . a cruel thing , more beast than man . trampling , with goat 's feet , on the gentlest flowers of spring . they know not the meaning of `` the green fire of life , ''
you say this but to comfort me , and in your great kindness of heart . dear , dear boy , cried [male] . as he rose from the chair , and staggered out to retrace his steps . in the hope of regaining that which had been lost , it so happened that the very truckman who was sent to take [male] 's trunks . was our friend [male] , who was plying in the vicinity .
the magistrate was wonderfully struck by his educational acquirements , deeply impressed by the excellence of his letters . exceedingly sorry to see a man of his attainments there , complimented him highly on his powers of composition . and was quite charmed to have the agreeable duty of discharging him , a collection was made for the `` poor fellow , '' as he was called in the reports , and i left the court with a comfortable sense of being universally regarded as a sort of monster . next day comes to me a friend of mine .
moreover , the prince had a nightingale that could sing in such a manner that it seemed as if all sweet melodies dwelt in her little throat . now the princess was to have the rose and the nightingale ; and they were accordingly put into large silver caskets and sent to her . the emperor had them brought into a large hall . where the princess and the ladies of the court were playing at `` visiting . '' when she saw the caskets with the presents .
first rode forth sir [male] skrintor . and against him appeared the son of the king of england . and [male] struck [male] so hard a blow that he was well nigh thrown from his horse . whereupon [male] , the king 's son . rode out and overthrew [male] skrintor , when prince [male] saw this he rode at [female] .
their shapes were too graceful , their complexions too delicate , and the cut of their dresses much too elegant . they were two fairies , the younger was not [organization] herself . but the chambermaid of one of [organization] 's attendants . who carries about her more trifling gifts , the elder one , who was named care . looked rather gloomy ; she always goes about to perform her own business in person .
as he strode away , they remained prostrate on the ground . and when they raised their heads , they saw his tall dark figure on the sandy horizon . he walked day and night until he reached the ruins of the temple . formerly built by the idolaters , in which he had slept amongst the scorpions and sirens on his former strange journey . the walls , covered with magic signs , were still standing , thirty immense columns .
that was all very pleasant until she grew tired and sat down on a stone to rest . then a great brown robber came and caught her and carried her down into his den . and there he kept her a prisoner in spite of her tears and prayers . and there she must wait on him and keep his house in order . every day he went out and left her along , coming back loaded down with food or golden treasure that he had stolen .
in the south west , a mile from the sea . lies old skjagen ; and here dwelt merchant [person] . and here [person] was henceforth to dwell , [organization] was painted with tar . the smaller buildings had each an overturned boat for a roof . the pig sty had been put together of pieces of wreck .
camaralzaman , thus deprived of liberty , was nevertheless pleased that he had the freedom to converse with his books . and that made him look on his imprisonment with indifference . in the evening he bathed and said his prayers . and after having read some chapters in the koran , with the same tranquility of mind as if he had been in the sultan 's palace . he undressed himself and went to bed .
oh , the little man only wanted his cap again , for without it he could not go back home into the hill . that was where he belonged , but how did the cap come to be hanging from the [female] ? yes , [female] would like to know that before she gave it back again . well , the little hill man was fishing by the brook over yonder when a puff of wind blew his cap into the water . and he just hung it up to dry , that was all that there was about it .
then at last the stranger saw his chance and changed his tune of fighting . with one upward stroke he sent [male] 's staff whirling through the air . with another he tapped [male] on the head . and , with a third broad swing , ere the other could recover himself , he swept him clear off the stage . much as you would brush a fly off the window pane .
when they met , the stranger stopped , and , to [male] 's great amazement . asked him for how much he would be willing to part with his horses . the old man tried to bargain with him ; but when he found that he had not much chance of succeeding . for no one ever did succeed in inducing [male] to sell a horse for a less sum than he named for it at first . he agreed to buy the animals , and , pulling a bag of gold from the pocket of his queerly cut breeches .
now and then a wave rolled over her ; and he was still a few cables lengths from the land , when help came in the shape of an approaching boat . but under the water -- he could see it clearly . stood a white form gazing at him . a wave lifted him up , and the form approached him .
inverliver faced about , with the largest portion of his party , to receive the calders . and , to deceive them , kept one of his men in the rear . having a sheaf of oats wrapped in a plaid . as if it were the child , who , however , had been previously sent off with a smaller escort under charge of one of his sons . with strict instructions to proceed to [male] 's castle with all speed .
one day [male] had gone out as usual , and [male] was sitting in the lodge on the opposite side to his brother 's wife . when a tall youth entered , his face was like the sun in its brightness . and he stood straight as a cedar tree . taking her by the hand , he led her to the door . the woman made no resistance , but turned as she left the lodge and cast upon [female] a smile of kind regard .
so saying he took his leave and followed by creeping shadow . set out on foot for the home of the wise one . the [male] little hut where the wise one lived was not far off . and soon they stood before its door , creeping shadow looked with astonishment at its bright red walls . covered with magic inscriptions , whose meaning was hidden from all but the wise one .
i felt a tide of merriment rising within me , i laughed . i have never seen on any human being 's face the look of horror which my mother turned on me when she heard my laugh . she crouched away from me in fear . her sobbing ceased , and her eyes remained fixed on me . they grew wider and wider .
back from england came the bishop full of the lore of early missions . he had enriched his zeal for broad basing the people 's worship on their own everyday earth . and for enlightening things opaque with effulgences invisible . he saw his way more clearly to further what he had at heart . [male] had had many letters , and they had had their effect .
they did not know that she meant to kill [female] and unsuspiciously accepted her offer . when they had finished cooking [female] asked the old woman whether she lived alone and she told him that she was a widow but had seven sons and they were all away on a trading expedition . the old woman kept on looking out to see if her sons were returning , and she had made an arrangement with them that if she ever wanted them she would set fire to a small hut and they would come home at once when they saw the smoke rising . but before her sons came back [female] and the princess finished their meal and paid the old woman and mounted [organization] and gallopped off . then the old woman set fire to the hut and her sons .
while on the hill the little elves came out and gazed , to be amused and were amazed ... they saw upon the shrinking sands the warriors with restless hands and busy blades . with shields that rose to buffet the unceasing blows ; they saw before the rising flood the flash of fire . the flash of blood ; and watched the men with panting breath . striving to be the slaves of death ; now darting wide , now swerving round .
scarcely , however , had she closed her eyes than every one in the vessel imagined he saw . in whatever direction he turned , a most horrible human head . it rose out of the waves , not like that of a person swimming . but perfectly perpendicular as if invisibly supported upright on the watery surface , and floating along in the same course with the bark . each wanted to point out to the other the cause of his alarm , but each found the same expression of horror depicted on the face of his neighbor .
the wind began to moan about the cottage , and grew louder and louder , till a great gust came down the chimney . and again scattered the white ashes all over the place , but the princess was by this time fast asleep . and never woke till the wind had sunk to silence , one of the consequences . however , of sleeping when one ought to be awake is waking when one ought to be asleep . and the princess awoke in the black midnight .
the young archer stood before the tzar , and his back was bent under the great weight of the fire bird . and the broad wings of the bird hung on either side of him like fiery shields . and there was a trail of golden feathers on the floor . the young archer swung the magic bird to the foot of the throne before the tzar . and the tzar was glad , because since the beginning of the world no tzar had seen the fire bird flung before him like a wild duck caught in a snare .
he took the sword mutely , wonderingly , how should it cause a door to open , he mused . everychild paused in the court long enough to explain to the sleeping beauty and his friends that he was setting forth on an important mission with will o'dreams . and then the two companions set forth from the castle and began the descent of the road which led down into the valley . soon they came upon the road which they had formerly traveled . the road of troubled children , and before the day was spent they had covered a great distance .
but it was only a sea mist passing before her eyes . and now she saw the real land she was bound to . beautiful blue mountains rose before her with their cedar woods and palaces . long before the sun went down she sat among the hills in front of a big cave covered with delicate green creepers . it looked like a piece of embroidery .
`` i would like it now , '' said [male] . with a weary sigh , and when he had finished he jumped upon the big red cushion and was soon fast asleep . my lady wind , my lady wind , went round about the house to find a chink to get her foot in . she tried the keyhole in the door . she tried the crevice in the floor .
in a certain kingdom in a certain land there lived a tsar . that tsar had three sons , -- two crafty . and the third simple , somehow the tsar had a dream that beyond the thrice ninth land . in the thirtieth kingdom , there was a beautiful [male] . from whose hands and feet water was flowing .
with the master words which move the living rock . the [male] caused the stone to open , and elined stepped forth . exceeding glad to see sir [male] and her brother again . and to feel the free air upon her cheeks , when it was morning they went on their way with great gladness . and when they reached the city of the fountain .
only nod sat gloomy and downcast , waiting impatiently till all should be lying fast asleep . one by one the outwearied travellers laid themselves down , with the palms of their feet towards the fire . nod heard the calling of the beasts in the ravine , and ever and again from far up the mountain side broke out the long hungry howl of the little wolves . only nod and the mountain mulgar whose turn it was to keep watch were now awake . he was a [male] old [male] .
imagine a tiny little lady , ethereal rather than thin , youthfully lovely and dainty . a kind of dream beauty . attired in a silvery tunic embroidered with gorse blossoms . on her head a wreath of heather . in her hand a wand of the broom plant in [female] .
the long wicks of the altar lights glimmer red . but there is a redder gleam upon the pavement . where the bishop lies with cloven skull , and his dead warriors around him . in the quiet of the holy christmas night . sink down into his grave -- into oblivion -- ye terrible shapes of the times of old !
human midwives are asked to help fairy mothers . fairy maidens marry ordinary men or girls marry and live with fairy husbands . all such things may have happened and bear no such a priori marks of impossibility as speaking animals . flying through the air , and similar incidents of the folk tale pure and simple . if , as archaeologists tell us , there was once a race of men in northern [location] .
suddenly , on a wide , sandy plain , he saw two old , old women sitting in the road . they were bent double over their work , sewing and sewing . and now one and now the other broke a needle , and took a new one out of a box between them . and threaded the needle with thread from another box , and went on sewing and sewing . their old noses nearly touched their knees as they bent over their work .
when [male] went home and told of the misfortune . the king was very sad , and a black flag was hoisted on the top of the palace . and the whole court went into mourning , now [male] , since it had been through his fault that his sister had been lost . wished to be allowed to seek her ; but his father would not let him do this . for [male] was his favourite son , but one day when his father was busy .
and that was how it was managed , and after that they went on happily . until they came to the wood , and the way grew more and more familiar . till at last they saw in the distance their father 's house . then they ran till they came up to it . rushed in at the door , and fell on their father 's neck .
though dodona was the most ancient of his shrines , the great national seat of the worship of [male] was at [male] in [male] . where there was a magnificent temple { 30 } dedicated to him , containing the famous colossal statue by [male] above described . crowds of devout worshippers flocked to this world-renowned fane from all parts of [male] . not only to pay homage to their supreme deity , but also to join in the celebrated games which were held there at intervals of four years . the olympic games were such a thoroughly national institution , that even greeks who had left their native country made a point of returning on these occasions .
still , if you looked closely at it , you would never guess it to be soap . it was black and coarse , and more like wood than anything else . if any unlucky pilgrim used it on his face or hands . it would make his skin burn like fire . but this did not often happen , for the people in [location] do not use much soap on themselves .
and they went up from the shore toward the city . through forests white with snow ; and [female] came out to meet them with a lean and woful face . and said , welcome , gallant heroes , to the land of bitter blasts . the land of cold and [male] ; yet i will feast you as best i can. and he led them in , and set meat before them .
replied the lady ; for who but yourself could suppose a woman serious when she told him where to find out a concealed lover ? i wanted to discover how far jealousy would carry you . and invented this trick for the purpose , the officer . upon this , was struck with admiration of his wife 's pleasantry and his own credulity . which so tickled his fancy that he laughed immoderately , begged pardon for his foolish conduct .
`` yes , gentlemen , '' answered the host , and he winked at the fox and the cat as much as to say . `` i know what you are up to , we understand one another ! '' no sooner had [male] got into bed than he fell asleep at once and began to dream . and he dreamt that he was in the middle of a field . and the field was filled with shrubs covered with clusters of gold pieces .
six months went by , and then came the joyful news that the king 's son had collected an army and had defeated the usurper who had taken his father 's place . but at the same moment [male] learned that the old king had died in captivity . the girl wept bitterly for his loss , but in secrecy . as she had told her [female] nothing about her past life . [female] did not want to be told twice , up she jumped , seized her basket .
but i recognised the sign of the king among the men . and i made for him , and the king cried out to stop the hounds . i took a leap upon the front of the king 's saddle . and the woman behind cried out , my king and my lord . kill him , or he will kill you .
before long [female] and her mother were alone ; but they felt that the ground they stood on , was enchanted . mother said it was like a scene from the opera . they watched the fire ; how the flames leaped and crackled . yet they were dying down , the fire made a bright contrast to the dark fir woods which formed the background to the picture . the glory died from the sky ; but yet it was strangely light .
if you have never heard the legend of [male] and the king 's pie . you will scarcely understand the above verse ; so i will tell you the whole story . and then you will be able to better appreciate the rhyme , [male] was an orphan . and lived with an uncle and aunt who were very unkind to him . they cuffed him and scolded him upon the slightest provocation .
fearful conflicts with robbers ; terrible struggles with wild animals . and strange encounters with sea serpents or similarly wonderful creatures . then he knew an immense deal about giants and dwarfs . witches and wizards , ogres and vampires . and he also possessed no little insight into all that concerned fairies and fairy land .
once upon a time a company of jugglers . acrobats , and other strays , traveling afoot to the fair of the golden bear . arrived at twilight in a glen close by a village and encamped there for the night . from eventide till late into the dark , the watchful villagers beheld their huge fire blazing behind the dark columns of the trees . but at dawn all was still , for the wanderers had risen by the glow of the morning star .
come , leave go , with this he caught the youngest by the hand . and tried to pull her back , but when he touched her he found he could not get away . and he too must needs run behind , then the sexton came along . and saw the [male] following on the heels of the three girls . this so astonished him that he called out , hi ! sir [male] .
a man in the east , where they do not require as much clothing as in colder climates . gave up all worldly concerns and retired to a wood , where he built a hut and lived in it . his only clothing was a piece of cloth which he wore round his waist . but , as ill luck would have it , rats were plentiful in the wood . so he had to keep a cat , the cat required milk to keep it .
the magistrate was much astonished at the accusation , and adjudged the cloak to my opponent . i however , offered the young man twenty . fifty , eighty , at last a hundred , zechins , in addition to his two hundred . if he would surrender it to me . what my entreaties could not accomplish , my gold did , he took my good zechins .
drawing up before the great gates , he tied his animal to a hinge . and walked in himself under the gate , going boldly into the hall . he went up stairs , or rather he ran up the top rail of the banisters . for it would have been hard work for him to have clambered up each separate step . as he expected , he found the giant ( whose name i forgot to say was [male] ) .
the boy caught it up , standing bent for the running as a bow to speeding the arrow . out he shot on the homeward path , and the fire spirits snapped and sung behind him . fast as they pursued he fled faster , until he saw the next runner stand up in his place to receive the brand . so it passed from hand to hand . and the fire spirits tore after it through the [male] until they came to the mountains of the snows .
but young [female] spoke up , my name 's [male] , ', said he . `` your name is not [male] , '' said the king . `` your name is—— '' he could not think of a name at the moment . so he stopped , `` take him to the parliament house , '' said the king , beside himself with rage .
at this account , [male] was thunderstruck , any other man would have sunk under the shock . but a sudden hope of disappointing his rival soon roused his spirits . and he bethought himself of the lamp . which had in every emergency been so useful to him ; and without venting his rage in empty words against the sultan . the vizier , or his son , he only said .
round about a tree in ever widening circles an eagle flies . alert watching o'er his nest ; loudly whistles he , a challenge sending far , o'er the country wide it echoes . there defying foes , once a hunter in the mountains heard a noise at night like a rushing wind . he went outside his tepee , and found an eagle was sitting on the drying pole . feasting at the deer he had shot , so he shot the eagle .
and [female] had become a different lad , no longer idle and careless , with slow and lingering tread . he was now alert , vigorous , and manly , the servants were glad to return and obey his wishes . the monastery was rebuilt and repaired , lawns and gardens were in trim array . warm tapestries and curtains lined the bare walls and windows . while ivy and rose clambered without , even [male] , roused from his invalidism .
she left the room , tears of helplessness and [female] filled her eyes . she was almost angry with him , but more angry with herself . but her self anger was mixed with shame , she was ashamed that he made her feel so much . while he felt nothing , did he feel nothing ? it 's my stupidity that keeps [location] apart , ', she whispered .
the king took the [male] , and struck the ball . which was returned by his officers that played with him ; he struck it again . and played so long , till his hand and his whole body were in a sweat . and then the medicine shut up in the handle of the [male] had its operation . as the physician said , upon this the king left off play .
but the two others let their father have no peace . and said that it was impossible that simpleton , who in everything lacked understanding . should be king , and entreated him to make a new agreement with them . then the father said , `` he who brings me the most beautiful ring shall inherit the kingdom , '' and led the three brothers out , and blew into the air three feathers .
thereupon the dove flew out of the door , and she followed it . and every seventh step it let fall a drop of blood and a little white feather to show her the way . so she wandered about the world , and never rested till the seven years were nearly passed . then she rejoiced , thinking that she would soon be free of her troubles . but she was still far from release , one day as they were journeying on in the accustomed way .
and on that he went down to the grocer again , and it was a good thing that he did go back . for the tub had nearly worn out the tongue , it had read everything that was inside it . on the one side , and was just going to turn itself round and read from the other side when the goblin came in and returned the tongue to its owner . but the whole shop , from the till down to the shavings . from that night changed their opinion of the tub .

it seemed so unaccountable , however , that the girl should have strayed over so many lands and seas ( which she herself could not have traversed without the aid of her winged dragons ) . that the good [female] tried to believe that it must be the child of some other parent . and not her own darling [female] who had uttered this lamentable cry . nevertheless , it troubled her with a vast many tender fears . such as are ready to bestir themselves in every mother 's heart .
his mother wished him not to venture up this strange [female] . but [female] coaxed her to give her consent to the attempt . for he was certain there must be something wonderful in the bean stalk .

ivan the fool would not tell her for a long time ; but as he loved her very much . and she begged very hard , he said : i have a ring with twelve screws . and it must be handled in such and such fashion , well , they lived on . the [male] of the matter was this : one of their servants pleased the tsarevna . he was a fine looking , shapely , strong fellow , and she conspired with him to [female] her husband .
but [person] cried : i will have no such conditions . no terms will i accept but such as are prescribed by the laws of chivalry ! then the trumpets sounded again , and the two ran at each other with great fury . it seemed to them who looked on that both the one and the other had forgotten all their skill in arms . so possessed were they with rage , they sought not to ward off blows .
when the messengers came to fetch her she was terribly frightened , for she knew that it was her wicked stepmother who in this way was aiming at her life . she begged that she might be allowed to spend another night in her father 's house . this was granted her , and she went to her mother 's grave . there she lamented her hard fate in being given over to the [female] . and earnestly prayed her mother for counsel .
sentaro , in his wish to escape from the country of perpetual life . recollected [male] , who had helped him before when he was wishing to escape from death . and he prayed to the saint to bring him back to his own land again . no sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of his pocket .

when her father saw her mounted and curvetting about the court , he gave her much wise advice . as to how she was to behave like the young man she appeared to be . and also how to behave as the girl she really was , then he gave her his blessing . and she touched her horse with the spur . the silver armour of herself and her steed dazzled the eyes of the people as she darted past .

zephyr , after he had seen [male] . was less surprised at the constancy of young and handsome ; but he did not make himself visible to the shepherd until he had restored him to the charming fairy . who could describe the perfect joy of [male] and young and handsome at seeing each other once more ? how lovely each appeared , and how fondly was each beloved , what thanks did not these fortunate lovers render to the deity who had secured their happiness . he left them shortly afterwards to return to [male] .
nevertheless , airily as she was clad , the child seemed to feel not the slightest inconvenience from the cold . but danced so lightly over the snow that the tips of her toes left hardly a print in its surface . while violet could but just keep pace with her . and [male] 's short legs compelled him to lag behind . all this while , the mother stood on the threshold .
ragingly angry with himself for being a meddlesome fool .

i gave them wine , and they gave me marsh water , ', he said . `` but it was all meant for the best , '' he could no longer see the betrothed couple and the cheerful old people . but for a long time he could hear them rejoicing and singing . then at last came two peasant boys , and looked into the reeds . they spied out the bottle , and took it up .

[male] , moved with sorrow and regret . instituted a yearly mourning for his loss , when her priests . the corybantes , with their usual noisy accompaniments . marched into the mountains to seek the lost youth , having discovered him they gave full vent to their ecstatic delight by indulging in the most violent gesticulations . dancing , shouting , and , at the same time , wounding and gashing themselves in a frightful manner .

the country of the hills of mud . the land of mu was sacrificed : being twice upheaved it suddenly disappeared during the night . the basin being continually shaken by volcanic forces , being confined , these caused the land to sink and to rise several times and in various places . at last the surface gave way and ten countries were torn asunder and scattered . unable to stand the force of the convulsions , they sank with their 64,000,000 of inhabitants 8060 years before the writing of this book .
well , but , my dear little man , you must learn to talk about such things . when you grow older , in a very different way from that , you must not talk about ai not and can not when you speak of this great wonderful world round you . of which the wisest man knows only the very smallest corner , and is , as the great sir [male] said . only a child picking up pebbles on the shore of a boundless ocean .

away he went across the field of flowers . through the courtyard , up the steep street , straight into the kitchen where his pretty sister sat eating artichokes and bread while the old woman twirled her distaff in the sun . both were used to strangers , for the cottage was a picturesque place . half hidden like a bird 's nest in vines and fig trees . with a gay little plot of flowers before it .
but , as the enchanter had vanished , he did not waste any more time in thinking . but went to seek the princess , who very soon consented to marry him , but after all . they had not been married very long when the king died , and the queen had nothing left to care for but her little son . who was called [male] , the little prince had large blue eyes . the prettiest eyes in the world , and a sweet little mouth .
the writer recollects to have heard this story , when a boy . from an old woman in [female] ; and he could probably point out the very field in the county of kildare where it occurred . a man and a boy were ploughing : the boy . as they were about in the middle of their furrow . smelled roast beef , and wished for some , as they returned .
then the goblin slipped from the king 's shoulder and went back to his home . and the king followed with determination , the heart of a good man is like the heart of the ocean . it can not be shaken , then the king went back under the sissoo tree . took the goblin on his shoulder , and set out in haste . and as he walked along , the goblin on his shoulder said .
none noticed [female] but a flock of magpies . which flew chattering round the top of the tree on which she sat . these birds hopped close to her on the branches with bold curiosity . a glance from her eyes was a signal to frighten them away . and they were not clever enough to find out who she was ; indeed she hardly knew herself .
the new ranee hated the seven poor princesses , and wanted to get them . if possible , out of the way , in order that her daughter might have all their riches and live in the palace as princess in their place . and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her , she did all she could to make them miserable . she gave them nothing but bread to eat . and very little of that , and very little water to drink ; so these seven poor little princesses .
as we have said , the watchman 's body had been taken to the hospital . and here it was placed in a room to be washed , naturally , the first thing done here was to take off the goloshes . upon which the soul was instantly obliged to return , and it took the direct road to the body at once . and in a few seconds the man 's life returned to him . he declared , when he quite recovered himself .
the ambassadors announced the wish of their lord in all the capitals of the neighbouring kingdoms . and very soon letters and portraits of princes in all imaginable attitudes began to arrive . some were twirling their moustaches with a martial air ; others scratched their chins as if they were irritated . and others with one hand on the hilt of their swords but wearing a magnanimous air . as if they would spare everybody 's life .
unfortunately , in those days , all church men did not understand , as he did . that the duties of their holy vocation were not consistent with these pastimes . for , in the year 507 , we find that councils and synods forbade priests to hunt . in spite of this , however , the ancient historians relate that several noble prelates . yielding to the customs of the times , indulged in hunting the stag and flying the falcon .
so spake the fairies , and went their way , leaving the most beautiful [male] in the world behind them . the next morning when the king looked from his window he saw this lovely creature hanging on the nail , ah ! what have i done ? surely i must have been blind last night , and he ordered long ladders to be brought and the [male] to be rescued . then he fell on his knees before her . and prayed her to forgive him , and a great feast was made in her honour .
the countess bent silently over the dying queen , listening for a breath . but in vain , not a sound disturbed the solemn stillness . only the golden eagle flapped his mighty wings . making a current of cool air through the lofty apartment , so that the rosy flames flickered in the crystal vessels . and threw a quivering reflection on the gilding of the walls and on the diamond crown at the dying queen 's feet .
the next morning the princess , seeking moss among the ferns , found her . when she saw that it was [female] . she went up to her and caressed her with her nozzle , as hinds do . and looked into her eyes until at last [female] knew full well that it was the princess turned into a white hind . she watched the hind attentively and saw two large tears fall from her eyes .
the bright sun moved slowly toward the south , the people were afraid that the manito was angry with them . but when the moon rose they were no longer sad , for from the moon the loving face of the manito was looking down upon them . night after night the people gazed at the [person] face . but at last a night came when the moon was not seen in the sky . the wise men went sorrowfully to the mountain top .
as [female] ceased , she touched the wondering fairies with her wand . and the dark faded garments fell away ; and beneath . the robes of lily leaves glittered pure and spotless in the sun light . then , while happy tears fell , queen dew drop placed the bright crowns on the bowed heads of the kneeling fairies . and laid before them the wands their own good deeds had rendered powerful .
so she did her mother 's bidding . and , standing one day by the window , she looked away into the far distance as if she were very sad . why are you standing there looking so sad ? asked the hunter , so he wrapped her round in his cloak and wished themselves to the [male] mountain . and in an instant there they were , sitting on it ! the precious stones sparkled so brightly on all sides that it was a pleasure to see them .
it is a very old tale that tells [location] of the passing of pan . in the reign of tiberius , on that day when . on the hill of calvary , at [female] in [location] . [female] died as a malefactor , on the cross -- and it was about the sixth hour , and there was a darkness all over the earth

but she bade good-bye to all this ceremony when she got into the water . and so remarkable were its effects upon her , especially in restoring her for the time to the ordinary human gravity . that [male] and [male] agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three years . in the hope that , as the water did her so much good . the earth would do her yet more , but the king had some vulgar prejudices against the experiment .
she was very fond of both of her foster parents . but her love for the medicine man was mingled with awe . when she saw him dressed for some religious dance or yearly festival . in his strange medicine dress , with his face painted in grotesque and horrible pattern . she fled to her mother and hid her face in her lap .

always go about as quietly as possible , in some of the very old manchester buildings that were built in the days before drain plans had to be submitted to the corporation . one finds under the cellar floors old-fashioned brick and flag drains ( better known as `` spit '' drains ) . that were left in when the place was built , once the rats get in these disused drains all the professional rat catchers in [location] could not clear them without pulling the building down . the rats have , by some means , got out of the main sewer . probably by the bursting of a sewer into one of these disused dry brick drains .

she had been chamber maid in a noble family , and had succeeded in marrying mr. [female] simply by the fact that she had made up her mind not to marry him . mr.

the shepherd child was now worse than ever the poor princess had been , for the wise woman had given her a terrible lesson one of which the princess was not capable . and she had known what it meant ; yet here she was as bad as ever . therefore worse than before , the ugly creature whose presence had made her so miserable had indeed crept out of sight and mind too—but where was she ? nestling in her very heart , where most of all she had her company . and least of all could see her , the wise woman had called her out .

then they all saw the beautiful hair of the murdered young man . and so they knew that he who lay in the bed was the murderer . the queen bee went out humming into the [female] , and she sung about how the flowers had avenged the young man 's death . and that behind every little flower leaf is an eye which can see every wicked deed . old and young , think on this , and so , fare ye well , his grandmother had told him .
time passed , and both of the princes flourished , [male] was nourished by his own mother . [male] by a hired nurse , they learned to babble and [male] . then to walk and talk , for in this respect the sons of dukes with grey locks are just like other boys . and yet no two children are alike , and if any schoolmaster tried to write an exhaustive treatise on the subject of education . it would have to contain as many chapters as there are boys and girls in the world .
just at this time , while they were talking together , some black clouds gathered about the giant 's middle . and burst into a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning . causing such a pother that [female] found it impossible to distinguish a word . only the giant 's immeasurable legs were to be seen , standing up into the obscurity of the tempest . and , now and then , a momentary glimpse of his whole figure , mantled in a volume of mist .
after a long walk they found hoppletyhop playing jackstraws with a grasshopper . on a bank of violets , he received them very politely . and asked each of them to take a stone among the violets . the grandfather then offered his presents , the dwarf read two sentences in the president 's message . and said he could not stand that ; it was too stupid , he peeped through the spectacles .
they held a short consultation and came to the resolution that they would lower [male] in a basket . and that they would remain above until [male] should pull the rope . and thus give them a signal to haul him up with all haste . so they lowered [male] , and deep below in the earth among beautiful valleys he found a splendid castle . into which he at once entered , in the castle he found a beautiful girl who at once warned him to run away as fast as possible if he valued his life .
his mother met him at the door . almost tired to death , having in forty eight hours travelled almost half a mile with a huge silver threepence upon his back . his parents were glad to see him , especially when he had brought such an amazing sum of money with him . they placed him in a walnut shell by the fire side . and feasted him for three days upon a hazel nut .
upon this shelf [male] 's uncle laid himself down . and crept forward , at about a hundred paces behind him stood [male] . upon the highest point of the rock , watching a great vulture hovering in the air . with a single stroke of his wing the bird might easily cast the creeping hunter into the abyss beneath . and make him his prey , [male] 's uncle had eyes for nothing but the chamois .
the king commanded him to write to his stepmother at once and bid her send her lovely step-daughter to the chapel of the palace . where the king would be waiting to marry her , the letter also contained promises of special royal favours . the lad wrote the letter , which the king sent by a special messenger . now a good story is soon told , but the deeds of which it is the sum are not performed so quickly . during the wedding feast the newly made bride forgot herself and smiled at her husband .
at this moment he returned with a bag of gold and silver coins . which he emptied on the table , and told her to help herself . she took four shillings , which was her primitive fee . neither more nor less ; and all his urgency could not prevail with her to take a farthing more . he looked so terrible at her refusal , that she rushed out of the house .
what joy , the loon 's nest was on the very edge of the little tiny island . hidden among the grasses , and in the nest were two big grayish brown eggs , with black spots . larger than any goose eggs , [female] and [female] shouted and laughed . but [female] felt strangely frightened and was very quiet , she begged her father to let her stand on the island . only a minute , and would he let her take one of the eggs in her hand ?
they stole down softly into the garden , and then jumped from the wall into the road . they ran as fast as their legs could carry them . but were so much afraid all the while , that they hardly knew which way to take . when the ogre waked in the morning , he said to his wife . grinning , `` my dear , go and dress the young rogues i saw last night . ''
the town was therefore dear to the god of literature . who has ever been ready to champion the cause of his scholars , whenever anyone has dared to lay a hand upon their privileges . a legend in which there is widespread belief declares that on one occasion . when the scholars of five counties had assembled at a triennial examination . the imperial examiner , who for some reason or other had conceived a spite against the competitors from this particular city .
the wretched beings were led away , and the [male] took said and his father into another apartment . here their conversation was interrupted by the yells of [male] . who was undergoing punishment in the court outside , the [male] invited benezar to bring his goods and settle in [location] . he gladly consented , and said spent his life in the palace built for him by the grateful [male] . indeed , the proverb ran in [location] , may i be as good and fortunate as said .
it was the chorus to one of them . and , to say the truth , nobody that i know has ever been able to pick any particular meaning out of it . but that , to be sure , is the case with many a song nowadays . at length said he to [male] . now , my dear boy , if you follow me .
at last we came to ourselves , and saw him sitting in the porch . looking at us , when he had considered [location] well . he advanced towards us . and laying his hand upon me , he took me up by the nape of my neck . and turned me round as a butcher would do a sheep 's head .
meantime the wise woman was busy as she always was . and her business now was with the child of the shepherd and shepherdess . away in the north , her name was [female] . her father and mother were poor , and could not give her many things . [female] would have utterly despised the rude , simple playthings she had .
the merchants had thrown their pieces of meat into the valley for several days . and each of them being satisfied with the diamonds that had fallen to his lot . we left the place the next morning . and travelled near high mountains , where there were serpents of a prodigious length . which we had the good fortune to escape , we took shipping at the first port we reached .
that he had held the water as long as he could . and had then thrown it in the sea basin solely because nothing else would contain it . notwithstanding this defence , the judge decided that , since he took the boys away and did not bring them back . he was guilty of murder , and sentenced him to decapitation . he entreated leave to pay one visit to his aged mother before his execution .
but this was soon forgotten when the prisoner he had taken , and whom the policy of the prince committed to his care and custody . declared himself as none other than colonel [male] . his uncle 's dearest and most intimate friend , he informed [male] that on his return from abroad he had found both sir [male] and his brother in custody on account of [male] 's reported treason . he had , therefore , immediately started for scotland to endeavour to bring back the truant . he had seen colonel [male] .
sterne gave evidence on the same day , and much to the same effect . but said that the white imp was like a cat but not so big , and when he asked [male] whether she was not afraid of her imps she answered , what ! do you think i am afraid of my children ? and she called the imp [female] as having red spots . and spoke of two more called sack and sugar , four other witnesses confirmed the story practically in its entirety .
from our happy home through the world we roam one week in all the year . making winter spring with the joy we bring . for christmas tide is here , now the eastern star shines from afar to light the poorest home . hearts warmer grow , gifts freely flow . for christmas tide has come , now gay trees rise before young eyes .
how long he sat there , neither i nor anybody else can tell you . but by and by he saw a little black ant creeping in through a crack in the floor . behind it came another and another , like soldiers marching ; one by one they came . till the whole floor was black with hundreds and hundreds of the ant people . you helped us , and we have come to help you , ', they said .
the [male] pulled the bobbin , and the door opened . and he fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment . for it was above three days that he had not touched a bit . he then shut the door and went into the grandmother 's bed . expecting little red riding hood , who came some time afterward and knocked at the door tap , tap .
in the convent she had reached the conviction that it would be degrading to think longer of the man who . in return for the most ardent love , offered nothing but alms in jingling coin . yet her poor heart would not cease its yearning , meanwhile she never wearied of seeking motives that would place his conduct in a more favourable light . whatever he might have withheld from her , he was nevertheless the best and noblest of men . and as she limped aimlessly on , the conviction strengthened that the mere sight of him would dispel the mists which .
and here , if you like , the cricket did chime in ! with a chirrup , chirrup , chirrup of such magnitude . by way of chorus ; with a voice . so astoundingly disproportionate to its size , as compared with the kettle ; ( size ! you could not see it ! ) that if it had then and there burst itself like an overcharged gun .
in this chamber stood a bed , on which lay the corpse . the unknown turned away his face , as if wishing to conceal his tears , he beckoned me to the bed . and bidding me set about my business speedily yet carefully , went out by the door . i seized my knives , which , as a physician , i constantly carried with me . and approached the bed , only the head of the corpse was visible .
as for the fisherman , as he was the first cause of the deliverance of the young prince . the sultan gave him a plentiful fortune . which made him and his family happy the rest of their days . in the reign of [male] al rusheed . there was at bagdad , a porter , who , notwithstanding his mean and laborious business .
but when she next shut the one eye , she forgot to open the other . and as soon as both her eyes were shut she fell asleep , the little fellow soon observed that . and slipped away , from that day forth , the owl has never dared to show herself by daylight . for if she does the other birds chase her and pluck her feathers out . she only flies out by night , but hates and pursues mice because they make such ugly holes .
the crow flew off and in a short time all the animals assembled before the [male] and paid their respects to him and expressed wishes for his speedy recovery . all except the jackals , they had been summoned along with the others . but somehow they paid no attention and only remembered about it in the afternoon . then they were very frightened as to what would be the consequence of their remissness . but one chief jackal stood up and told them not to fear .
the woman instantly wrote another letter , which ran thus : you have brought to my house a prostitute . who has brought shame upon you , for she has been confined of two puppies . she folded the letter , sealed it as the first had been . and put it into the messenger 's bag . next morning the messenger left , having first been invited to spend the night at her house on his return .
it is the lack of general knowledge which makes it possible for furniture built on amazingly bad lines to be sold masquerading under the name of some great period . the customer soon becomes bewildered , and , unless he has a decided taste of his own . is apt to get something which will prove a white elephant on his hands . one must have some standard of comparison , and the best and simplest way is to study the great work of the past . to study its rise and climax rather than the decline .
so the mother called [female] to help her . he was very reluctant to go ; but , when the mother kissed him . and promised to make him a beautiful ball . and cover it with red [location] , he came forward and took the basket readily . on , on they went , far out into the sand hills .
formerly before the santals came into the country the four taluqs of sankara . [female] , [organization] and [organization] formed the paharia raj and the whole country was dense jungle . then the santals came and cleared the jungle , and brought the land under cultivation . the paharia raja of [male] was named [male] and he paid tribute to the [male] raja . once ten or twelve paharias went to [male] to pay the annual tribute , after they had paid in the money the raja gave them a feast and a room to sleep in and sent them one bed .
the moment the man regained his feet he looked all round . over the wide sunny plain , to discover his fortunate vanquisher . but could see neither him nor his shadow , the latter seeming particularly to be the object of his search . for previous to our encounter he had not had leisure to observe that i was shadowless . and he could not be aware of it , becoming convinced that all traces of me were lost .
so the matter remained as it had first been settled , [male] became the servant of this monster and his mother . a terrible fix , i really do not know what will come of it . the next day , the she dragon gave him his task . they were to give a signal to the dragon world with a club sheathed in seven thicknesses of iron . the dragon raised the club and hurled it three miles .
after about 100,000 years of this golden age the degeneracy and decay of the race set in . many of the tributary kings , and large numbers of the priests and people ceased to use their faculties and powers in accordance with the laws made by their divine rulers . whose precepts and advice were now disregarded , their connection with the occult hierarchy was broken . personal aggrandisement , the attainment of wealth and authority . the humiliation and ruin of their enemies became more and more the objects towards which their occult powers were directed .
then [female] told her that he had a key that would unlock the door and that he would save her . the bird maiden was very glad , but she said they must make haste . for it was almost time for the robber to come home . so she wrapped her cloak around her . and [female] took her by the hand and together they ran to the door .
the swans came close up to her with rushing wings . and stooped round her , so that she could throw the shirts over them . and when that had been done the swan skins fell off them , and her brothers stood before her in their own bodies quite safe and sound . but as one shirt wanted the left sleeve , so the youngest brother had a [female] 's wing instead of a left arm . they embraced and kissed each other , and the queen went up to the king .
they had gone a good distance across the sea before the [female] had finished her bathing . the [female] made haste , for it was now growing late . but when she stepped upon the deck she saw nothing but the sea around her . at this she fell a weeping bitterly , what would become of her ? she said . whither was she going ? into whose hands was she about to fall ?
hundreds of swans had been towing the carpet along . and were still holding it with their beaks , while a crowd of doves walked about on it . smoothing out the creases and patting it with their pretty pink feet till it was quite firm and straight . the swans then swam away , and they flew away , presently troops of fairies came down to the landing place . jumped into [person] 's boat without asking leave .
but he kept thinking of what the serpent had said . and , as good fortune dwelling upon [location] is something we all like to have . the forester kept on his way and resolved faithfully to carry out his errand . he came at last to the palace gates . and as , in those days , in that country , any one who wanted to could walk in and speak to the king .
but the boat had already passed through the caverns , and so they had to pursue it farther on . [female] and the woman were rowing—rowing for dear life . their pursuers close in their wake , the mermaids whipped up the waters . the swift foam fairies darted after the boat . the angry waves rose up in wrath behind them .
this time the battle was soon over , for the giant . like many very big people , was heavy and clumsy , and the knight of the sun stepped past his dead body to the third gate . which flew open at the blast of his horn , behind it stood a fresh giant taller than the last . and all covered with thick wiry hair , that looked as if it would resist the keenest sword blade which had ever been forged in [male] . the young knight felt much more afraid of him than of the two tigers which he held on a chain .
so the minstrel 's son went back to the palace with princess [female] . and when the king and queen saw how happy their little daughter was at last . they said nothing more about deaf [male] not being a prince . but got over the difficulty by making him a marquis on the spot and giving him the appointment of playfellow in chief to her royal highness . a magnificent banquet was given to celebrate this important event , at which several speeches were made by the king and several tunes were played by the band .
there was just a pigeon there , at that moment the young man came back to the tree with the food he had procured . when the little black maid heard his footsteps she was frightened nearly to death . she hid herself quickly among the thick branches of the tree . the young man was very much surprised to find a little black maid in the tree in the place of the beautiful [male] he had left there . `` what has happened to you during my absence '' he asked in horror as soon as he saw her .
so saying , he plucked the parson by the sleeve . and soon found that he could not get away , as this party of five . one behind the other , tramped on , two peasants came along the road , carrying their hoes . the parson called them , and asked them to set the sexton and himself free . but as soon as ever they touched the sexton they were held fast .
you have only got to go out at the door , and climb about . there are a great many windows you have not seen yet , and some of them look into places you do not know anything about . i used to clean them myself . but i am getting rather old , you see , ai not i now ? ` i can not tell , ', i answered . ` you see i never saw you when you were younger .
what golden letter days in their memory were these that had marked her growing up from babyhood . the visit to the temple when she was just thirty days old . her proud mother carrying her , robed in ceremonial kimono . to be put under the patronage of the family 's household god . then her first dolls festival , when her parents gave her a set of dolls
hearing [male] shriek , and not able to see from his prison what had befallen her . [female] shouted out in terror to know if she had come to any hurt . `` no , '' she told him ; and stood eyeing first the crocodile 's hide and then the cups . setting her lips together very firmly , `` and they were not even dry , '' she said after a while . for she began to guess a little of the truth , `` oh , [female] ! ''
in that joyous company he came to wide allen of leinster . where the people were surprised to see the hounds and the fawn and the chief and none other of the hunters that had set out with them . late that night , when he was preparing for rest . the door of [female] 's chamber opened gently and a young woman came into the room . the captain stared at her , as he well might .
there were no more little warriors -- only a lot of old toothpicks scattered over the [female] . the young wife had been too lazy to put her toothpicks away properly ; and every day . after having used a new toothpick , she would stick it down between the [female] on the floor . to get rid of it , so the little fairies who take care of the floor mats became angry with her . and tormented her , her husband scolded her .
he then went through various nautical exercises—such as boxing the compass . and shivering his timbers , and danging his lee deadlights , and other things which it takes a sailor . or a nautical novel writer , to understand , the effect of these operations was to make the sails run up . and then the vessel bent to the freshening gale and began to walk the waters like a thing of life—at least . as like a thing of life as a wet sheet and a flowing sea and a wind to follow after .
once upon a time there was a peaceful kingdom which you will hardly find upon the map . in one corner of the kingdom by the sea was the pretty little town of [male] . where a great many strange things had happened in the past , the chronicles of which filled the town library . on the high street of [male] lived a boy named [male] . who was chief of all the boys in town .
separated by his birth and dwelling place from mankind in general . [male] strove to benefit the few he could befriend . the island people , as a rule . rarely beheld him , but in sickness or trouble they ever turned to the castle gate . where they waited while the [male] apprised his master of the presence of the suppliants without .
in the meanwhile , the prince hurriedly gave all the necessary orders for keeping his departure secret . and the next day , as soon as everybody in the palace had retired to their apartments . he hastened to join [male] in the pavilion in the garden . where she awaited him , attended only by [male] . they set out , and made incredible haste to pass the frontiers of the kingdom .
i struggled out of the swing and scrambled , breathless , back from the tree and looked where she should be . already i knew her , nearly , i knew the things that she would say to me . sometimes now i know the things that she would have said if we had not been interrupted , `` come ', ere once ! '' they commanded , their voices falling like sharp pebbles about the apple blossom lady and me . there was no doubt about it , here were no longer soft skirts .
[male] was , physically considered , as fine grown , and moreover as handsome a boy as ever was seen . but it must be acknowledged that he was not very clever , nature is . in most instances , very impartial ; she has given plumage to the peacock . but , as everyone knows , not the slightest ear for music . throughout the feathered race it is almost invariably the same ; the homeliest clad are the finest songsters .
then , as even to this day , the game of hurling -- a sort of primitive rugby football . was a popular pastime with the people , village used to play against village . with goals perhaps four or five miles apart , and the good folk ofcleer were as fond of the game as any of their neighbours . so fond , in fact , that they would play it on any and every occasion . despite the admonitions of their local saint and parson .
[female] in his youth was fond of all manly exercises . especially of wrestling , an art in which he found few equals . the old men who had been the champions of earlier days . and who still sat , in summer evenings , watching the youths who tried their skill before them . at last told him that he had no rival in cornwall .
jealousy impels the human wife to tamper with these talismans . and the children are condemned to remain in their animal form , this folk tale was . probably at some time in the 14th or 15th century , arbitrarily fitted into the cadre of the tuatha de danann cycle . and entirely re fashioned in a spirit of pious edification by a man who was in his way a great and admirable artist . the origin and nature of the story .
the colosseum was a ruin ; the church bells rang . the incense arose and processions passed through the streets with tapers and gorgeous canopies . the church was holy , and art was lofty and holy also . in rome dwelt [male] , the greatest painter of the world . here also dwelt [male] , the greatest sculptor of the age .
`` odds splutter hur nails ! '' cried the giant , not to be outdone , `` hur can do that hurself ! '' whereupon he seized the carving knife , and ripping open his own belly fell down dead . now it so happened that in those days , when gallant knights were always seeking adventures . king [male] 's only son .
the temples were huge halls resembling more than anything else the gigantic piles of [location] . but built on a still more stupendous scale , the pillars supporting the roof were generally square , seldom circular . in the days of the decadence the aisles were surrounded with innumerable chapels in which were enshrined the statues of the more important inhabitants . these side shrines indeed were occasionally of such considerable size as to admit a whole retinue of priests whom some specially great man might have in his service for the ceremonial worship of his image . like the private houses the temples too were never complete without the dome capped towers .
almost all of the water used in [female] is carried from the river to the pueblo . a distance ranging from a quarter to half a mile . the women and girls of a dozen years or more probably transport three fourths of the water used about the house . it is carried in four to six gallon ollas borne on the head of the woman or shoulder of the man . women totally blind , and many others nearly blind , are seen alone at the river getting water .
the tourney was fought , and in spite of [male] 's fears [male] managed to hang back to make attacks which were never meant to succeed . and to allow strokes which he could easily have parried to attain their end . at length , after a great show of resistance . he fell heavily to the ground , and as he fell he knew that it was not alone the glory that was his rightfully which he gave up . but the hand of the queen that was more precious still , but [male] did not even wait to see if he was wounded .
the fire god is worshiped as the lord of the holy southern mountain . in the skies the fiery star . the southern quarter of the heavens and the red bird belong to his domain . when there is danger of fire the fiery star glows with a peculiar [male] . when countless numbers of fire crows fly into a house .
so when darkness came , he returned to the spot . and hid behind a rock , he waited a long time . and at last he saw a [male] of tiny canoes come spinning over the waves . they ranged themselves in a line at a distance from the shore . and [male] could see many little figures in them bending and pulling .
it was the fairy , and her name was `` sorrow . '' a hot tear rolled into her lap , and formed itself into a [female] . glowing with all the colors of the rainbow , the angel seized it . the [female] glittered like a star with seven fold [female] . the [female] of sorrow , the last , which must not be wanting , increases the lustre .
in the meantime the fairy [female] had sent [female] back to the queen . who was all anxiety to know how the wedding , had gone off , but when her daughter arrived and told her all that had happened she was terribly angry . and of course all her wrath fell upon [female] . `` she shall have cause to repent that the king admires her , '' said the queen , nodding her head meaningly , and then she and [female] went up to the little room in the tower where the princess was imprisoned .
king [male] , however , and the red branch heroes . distrusted [male] so much that they refused to accept the invitation . unless [male] would give sureties that , having received his guests . he would leave the hall before the feasting began . [male] , who had expected some such condition , readily agreed , and before going home to prepare his feast took measures for stirring up strife among the heroes of ulster .
here the women worked and gossiped , —the babies in their cradles . strapped to their mothers backs , or propped up against the trunks of trees . and staring with round black eyes at the new and strange scenes around them . among the women was one pretty young mother . who watched , as she worked , her little son in his cradle .
at last they came to [location] , [female] lamented that it was in july they came . but [female] , who had no recollections of [location] in [female] and may . found nothing to lament , they stayed more than a month . and made a number of the enchanting little journeys which can be made out of [location] forever and ever without repeating , it seems . then , with a trunk in which were two `` really , truly '' [location] dresses .
this [female] was her eldest son , she loved him more than all the others because he was inclined to be red headed . and she herself was rather red , they sat down at the table and ate with an appetite which it did their parents good to see . they all talked at once , as they recounted the fears they had felt in the forest . he could not think what to do until the wood cutter 's wife gave them each a piece of bread for breakfast . then it occurred to him to use the bread in place of the stones .
in that time in which the portion of tuscany called casentino was not yet subject to the florentines . but was ruled by its own counts , in the lands of poppi . an important place in that valley through which runs the river arno . and not far from its source , a son was born to a certain good man named [male] . to whom he gave the name of [male] .
the garden at the back of the castle led into the dense forest by which the mountains were covered . [female] would sit on the stone wall and gaze into the deep shades . as if she could see things there that were invisible to others . she knew how to call the deer , one day she enticed a fine stag into the garden . she made a garland of cornflowers and ox eye daisies .
flight of the boys , pursued by the ogre in seven leagued boots . there is a choice of conclusion , in one [male] o my [male] steals the boots of the sleeping ogre . and gets his treasures from the ogre 's wife , [male] o my [male] steals the boots and by their aid wins court favour .
she had hardly spoken when all the forest was lighted up with a sudden glow . every tree seemed to be sending out a soft [female] , which was clearer than moonlight and softer than daylight . and at the end of a long avenue of trees opposite to her the princess saw a palace of clear crystal which blazed like the sun . at that moment a slight sound behind her made her turn around . and there stood [male] himself , did i frighten you , my princess ? ', said he .
`` very well ; try , '' shouted [female] , who was not a bit afraid . for he saw the giant was so tipsy he could hardly stand . much less run ; and he himself had young legs and a clear conscience . which carry a man a long way , so , after leading the giant a considerable race . he contrived to be first at the top of the bean stalk .
they came ashore , but all in great excitement , the mouse and the cat began to beat the dog . who thrust his tail between his hind legs as if to acknowledge his fault . but had to defend himself against the sharp paws of the cat and the fine teeth of the mouse . quarreling and howling and rolling upon the sand . they came to the fisherman 's hut .
meanwhile the wicked wife , announcing that her husband had died while on a journey to some foreign land . enjoyed his wealth and his castle , a year later . the king went hunting in the forest , and , after a stout chase . had nearly run down the unhappy [male] , when that persecuted beast , bounding from his thicket . fawned upon the king 's feet , shedding real tears and uttering almost human cries for [male] .
once upon a time there lived a king and queen who longed to have a son . as none came , one day they made a vow at the shrine ofjames that if their prayers were granted the boy should set out on a pilgrimage as soon as he had passed his eighteenth birthday . and fancy their delight when one evening the king returned home from hunting and saw a baby lying in the cradle . all the people came crowding round to peep at it . and declared it was the most beautiful baby that ever was seen , of course that is what they always say .
the prince was beside himself with grief . and in his despair he sprang out of the window . he was not killed , but his eyes were scratched out by the thorns among which he fell . he wandered about blind in the wood . and had nothing but roots and berries to eat .
she went to her press in `` the room '' and took out her sunday gown of brown drugget , she then opened a drawer and drew forth a pair of white stockings . a long snowy garment of fine linen , and a cap . her `` dead dress , '' as she called it . these articles of attire had long been ready for a certain triste ceremony .
so the [male] sent his son in law that he might cure the damsel -- twould be nothing to such a master of mysteries as he , they said . all that he could say was in vain , the poor fellow had to set out . and as soon as he arrived they led him at once into the sick chamber . but now the ghost of the well had a word to say in the matter .
at this the frog disappeared ; and the next minute the youth beheld a lovely little chariot . drawn by two tiny ponies , standing on the road , the frog was holding the carriage door open for him to step in . `` come with me , '' she said , and he got up and followed her into the chariot . the first witch waved her magic wand over the frog . and changed her into the loveliest girl that had ever been seen , the second witch waved the wand over the tiny chariot and ponies .

whilst they walked in this manner along the streets of [female] . with their arms and feet naked , clad in such a strange garment . and endeavouring to hide their confusion under their hair , with which they covered their faces . all the people were dissolved in tears ; more especially the ladies . considering them as innocent persons , as they beheld them through their lattice windows .
meantime the wanderers were hospitably entertained by the old woman and her grandchild and they were all very comfortable and happy together . little [male] sat upon [male] 's knee . and he told her stories about the mines and his adventures in them . but he never mentioned the king or the princess . for all that story was hard to believe , and he told her about his mother and father .
there were also secondary and tertiary enneads of lesser gods , when the sun god [male] became prominent . [male] was omitted and the eight other gods were called children of [male] . who headed the group , as in the pyramid texts . the nine are not composed of three triads , but of four pairs and a leader . this is on the same type as the four pairs of elemental gods at hermopolis under the chief god [male] .
as soon as the four minstrels had done , they put out the light . and each sought for himself a sleeping place according to his nature and to what suited him . the donkey laid himself down upon some straw in the yard . the hound behind the door , the cat upon the hearth near the warm ashes . and the cock perched himself upon a beam of the roof .
he ran into the kitchen in a great hurry to wash it off . and the duck splashed some water in his face . he wanted to dry it with the towel . but the egg rolled up against him , broke , and glued up his eyes . he wanted to rest , and sat down in the chair , and then the pin pricked him .
while [female] told her tale and the ladies questioned and comforted her . this bad monkey had skipped downstairs and had a delightful party all by himself . he was just scraping the jelly out of a tart when they disturbed him . and knowing that more slaps were in store for him if he stayed . he at once walked calmly down the ravaged table , and vanished out of the window carrying the silver tea strainer with him to play with .
once upon a time there was a widowed old man who lived alone in a hut with his little daughter . very merry they were together , and they used to smile at each other over a table just piled with bread and jam . everything went well , until the old man took it into his head to marry again . yes , the old man became foolish in the years of his old age . and he took another wife , and so the poor little girl had a stepmother .
the princess , who always had [female] in her mind . imagined that the prince might be aboard ; and resolved to visit the ship and meet him . without discovering herself ; but to observe him , and take proper measures for their making themselves mutually known . under pretence of inquiring what merchandize was on board . and having the first sight of the goods , she commanded a horse to be brought .
[female] said that there had only been enough for the thills , pole , and rack . when his master heard such words . he took [male] by the ear . led him out , and gave him such a beating that never again in his whole life did he forget that only the axles of a cart are to be greased . well , what was the mother 's darling to do -- he was obliged to bear it .
and she gave her grandchildren a bottle of milk and a piece of [female] and a loaf of bread . and they set out for the great gloomy wood , when they reached it they saw in front of them . in the thickest of the trees , a [female] little hut . and when they looked into it , there lay the witch . with her head on the threshold of the door .
a margrave that was there deemed he meant this truly . he saw one of his kinsmen lying in his blood . and put his arms round him to bear him away . him the minstrel shot dead . when the others saw this , they fled , and began to curse [male] .
by his side were the high ki , mounted upon twin chestnut ponies that had remarkably slender limbs and graceful , arched necks . the ponies moved with exactly the same steps , and shook their manes and swished their tails at exactly the same time . behind the prince and the high ki were king [male] . riding his great white charger , and [male] on a stout horse of jet black color . the two ancient ki and [male] .
after he had satisfied his hunger , he thanked the shepherd . and offered him one of the groschen which the fish had given him . but the old man refused it , [male] insisted . for it hurt his pride to take anything as a gift from a man clad in rags . but the shepherd still declined , and added , after he had noticed the fine clothes of the little prince .
it was a figure more gigantic than [male] had ever imagined possible . it had long yellow hair , in its hand it carried a great white bowl . big enough to float a navy in , if such an expression did not sound rather silly . i should say that this figure gave [male] the idea of a little girl giant . it sat down among the [male] forest , crushing millions of trees as it sat .
if so , what wonderful feats of [male] would he not perform . he would surpass all comrades in courage and dexterity . he would be rewarded with knighthood ; and then he would have the right to mingle with the best and noblest of the land . and then—then there would flash across his mind a vision of a brave knight fighting to assert the lawful claims of a fair lady . of his being successful , of his being rewarded by the hand and heart of the beautiful heroine .
the nurse gave her a great pull by the hand she held . but at that instant the something in the middle of the way . which had looked like a great lump of earth brought down by the rain . began to move , one after another it shot out four long things , like two arms and two legs . but it was now too dark to tell what they were , the nurse began to tremble from head to foot .
down sprang the cat , but the goat stood on his hind legs to butt back at the wind . the wind caught him between the beard and the under quarters and swept him from the top and down the other side of the hill ( and what happened to the hag 's goat after this i never heard ) . the king of the cats put his claws into the crevices of a standing stone and held to it with great tenacity . and then , when the wind abated and he looked across his shoulder . he found that he was standing beside the nest of the eagle emperor .
later , in historical and decorative painting , it served the state . and at length , in portrait and landscape painting . in pictures of genre subjects and still-life . abundant opportunity was afforded for all orders of talent . and the generous patronage of art by church .
the mermaid of the scottish highlands was the same as in the rest of the kingdom . a sea creature , half fish half woman . with long dishevelled hair , which she sits on the rocks by the shore to comb at night . she has been known to put off the fishy covering of her lower limbs . any one who finds it can by hiding it detain her from ever returning to the sea again .
and their own sweet little faces were already dissolved in tears ; so that their father . seeing what strange things occasionally happen in this every day world , felt not a little anxious lest his children might be going to thaw too ! in the utmost perplexity , he demanded an explanation of his wife . she could only reply , that , being summoned to the parlour by the cries of violet and [female] . she found no trace of the little white [female] .
about the end of the seventeenth century or the beginning of the eighteenth . an impostor , calling himself the wandering jew . attracted attention in [location] , and was listened to by the ignorant . and despised by the educated , he , however , managed to thrust himself into the notice of the nobility . who , half in [location] , half in curiosity .
once upon a time there was a [female] who was very pretty , but lazy and careless . when she used to spin , she was so impatient that , if there chanced to be a little knot in the thread . she snapped off a long bit with it and threw the pieces down on the ground near her . now she had a servant girl , who was industrious , and used to gather together the shreds of thread . clean them , and weave them , till she made herself a dress with them .
but the glass mender made two conditions about his marriage . the first was that he was to continue to be a wandering glass mender who earned his living by going from city to city . and from village to village , mending glass , and the second was that rainbow was never to ask him where he came from nor who were his parents . and that she should call him blue eyes . nor ever ask him whether he had another name .
it will be easier to carry it. the sparrow then gave them the light basket . and they returned with it to their home . `` let [location] open and see what is in it , '' they said . and when they had opened it and looked , they found gold and silver and jewels and rolls of silk . they never expected anything like this , the more they took out .
whereby sir [male] . and the keeper , and the steward , and the gardener . and the ploughman , and the dairymaid , and all the hue and cry together . went on ahead half a mile in the very opposite direction , and inside the wall . leaving him a mile off on the outside .
lady [female] 's pride was deeply wounded ; she gave a hasty glance at the knight of the fish . and intimating to him that he should follow her . she showed him over the castle . where he beheld many strange things , but she did not afford him any opportunity of referring to them . the wicked old woman took him through an obscure corridor .
luckily no one was about , it was windy when she looked up the great chimney . so she took her long , fair hair . and made it into a loose plait in order to keep it from blowing about her face . then she prepared to start and secure the first footing , [female] had never been up a chimney before . and when she began climbing she was quite surprised to find how nice and clean it was .
the next day [female] gave grains to the little red hen and begged for words . after a while the little red hen murmured , there are things i know . and things i about know . but i do know what grows near the ground , and if you pull a certain herb . and put it round the necks of the cats they will not be able to see in the light nor in the dark .
once upon a time there was a king who had seven sons . and he was so fond of them that he never could bear to have them all away from him at once . and one of them always had to stay with him , when they had grown up . six of them were to go forth and look for wives . but the youngest the king wanted to keep at home , and the others were to bring along a bride for him .
it cost him no little work to get out of it . and still the shock left him so weak that he could hardly move . as well as he could , he approached the nearest village and got into bed . the first person whom he met was the cunning peasant who had so badly translated his majesty 's letter . he was flying from [male] suero and had come face to face with him where he least expected to .
`` all ashore that 's going ashore , '' shouted the hoarse voice of captain [female] . then came the tinkle jingle of the bell and the ark quivered from bow to stern . and in another moment was off on the dark waters , the first night on the ark was most uncomfortable . it was not an easy thing to provide sleeping quarters for the animals . and although captain [male] and his three sons did their best .
and she , bending her great eyes on him . said `` swear , '' and he swore , by the ten grasp sword that was girded on him . and after that he swore by the jewels in her hair . then she suffered him to cross over the tranquil river of heaven . and also to cross over the floating bridge , so [male] , the impetuous , entered the dominions of his sister .
moved with pity for the man , the merchant advised him to visit the kind and generous king of that country . and offered to accompany him to the court , now at that time it happened that the king was seeking for a brahman to look after a golden temple which he had just had built . his majesty was very glad , therefore , when he saw the brahman and heard that he was good and honest . he at once deputed him to the charge of this temple . and ordered fifty kharwars of rice and one hundred rupees to be paid to him every year as wages .
but when the sirens saw that they were conquered , they shrieked for envy and rage . and leapt from the beach into the sea . and were changed into rocks until this day , then they came to the straits by lilybaum . and saw sicily , the three cornered island , under which [male] the giant lies groaning day and night . and when he turns the earth quakes .
now [male] had resolved to reveal himself at this feast to the father whom he yearned to embrace . before tasting the wine he put his plan into execution . and drew out his sword so that the eyes of the king might rest upon it . when [male] beheld once more the well-known weapon which he had so often wielded . he knew that it was his son who stood before him .
after a little more talk , mrs. [female] decided to allow the magpie to sound the [female] upon the subject . and appointed another meeting upon the following day in order to discuss the matter further . then the magpie , having done a good morning 's work . and successfully laid the train by which she hoped to carry out her plot with the weasel . flew chuckling off , whilst the weasel stole silently away , and occupied himself on his own affairs .
then she went in to her mother , and as she had returned covered with gold she was well received . so the girl related all her history , and what had happened to her , and when the mother heard how she came to have such great riches she began to wish that her ugly and idle daughter might have the same good fortune . so she sent her to sit by the well and spin . and in order to make her spindle bloody she put her hand into the [female] hedge . then she threw the spindle into the well .
he sometimes , indeed , climbed higher than the goats , for he was fond of seeking for birds' nests at the top of high trees . he was bold and daring , but was seldom seen to smile , excepting when he stood by the roaring cataract . or heard the descending roll of the avalanche , he never played with the other children . and was not seen with them , unless his grandfather sent him down to sell his curious workmanship . [male] did not much like trade ; he loved to climb the mountains .
there was no end to [male] brown 's spite even until [male] 's life ended . once upon a time a little jackal lived near the bank of a great river . every day he went down to the water to catch the crabs that were there . one day the alligator hid in the mud . where the water was shallow near shore , only the tip of his nose stuck out .
there was once a man who had twelve sons : the eleven eldest were both big and strong . but the twelfth , whose name was [male] . was only a little fellow , the eleven eldest went out with their father to field and forest . but [male] preferred to stay at home with his mother . and so he was never reckoned at all by the rest , but was a sort of outcast among them .
the african , with blunt features , thick lips . and woolly hair , sits on the marble steps of the palace in the capital of [location] , and begs . he is the submissive slave of camoens . and but for him , and for the copper coins thrown to him by the passers-by . his master , the poet of the `` lusiad , ''
many years ago , and many miles away , there was a little prince who was exactly like the lord chamberlain 's son . and sometimes even the artful old chamberlain himself could not tell one from the other . when the prince became king of noware . they were still alike as two peas , and one day . when they were playing in the garden , a magic [male] suddenly grew up behind the king .
then he smote his hands together sharply and , at the signal . the chief imp came rushing to learn his desire , the chief imp raised the book of craft from the table and bearing it carefully in his outstretched hands . disappeared with it from the hall , a moment later he returned and carried away the box of wands in the same manner . with him came many imps , who laid hands upon the ponderous urns and with heavy rumblings rolled them slowly away out of the cave hall . in the meanwhile prince [male] stood still watchful beside the wall .
the party had listened with interest to this speech . but by the time it was ended the hour was late . and they went their ways homeward , leaving only one man who had sat unheeded in a corner the whole evening through . master [male] had once been a prosperous innkeeper . and a master cook ; but he had gone steadily down in the world for some time .
but she bade her son eat and drink what was before him . and said that the poor young man was much to be pitied , and that the sun had granted him his life in order that he might consult the wind . then she brought out the young man , who explained how he was seeking for his palace . and that no man had been able to tell him where it was . so he had come to the wind , and he added that he had been shamefully robbed .
looking despairingly upward , i made a tolerably good beginning at thinking of all the mean actions i had wrought in the flesh . when i saw projecting beyond the crest of the wave a ship 's bowsprit . with a man sitting on it , reading a newspaper ! thank fortune , we were saved ! falling upon our knees with tearful gratitude , we got up again and ran .
after supper they went to sleep on a nice deer skin . spread upon the floor , but some how that night the old man could not sleep . he got up two or three times to look at the children . with the tears standing in his eyes , he was living over the past . `` bless her little heart , '' he said , smoothing with his rough hand the soft wavy hair of the little girl .
and , although he was so far off , [male] appeared to recognize his son . for he also took off his cap and waved it . and tried by gestures to make him understand that he would have returned if it had been possible . but that the sea was so tempestuous that he could not use his oars or approach the shore . suddenly a tremendous wave rose and the boat disappeared , they waited .
a light limbed , jolly looking old fellow , in a barracan jacket and gaiters . with a smile of welcome , and a very sharp , red nose . that seemed to promise good cheer , opened the door with a promptitude that indicated a hospitable expectation of my arrival . there was but little light in the hall , and that little lost itself in darkness in the background . it was very spacious and lofty , with a gallery running round it .
at length she could control herself no longer . so she sent a [female] servant to her old and faithful friend the fairy of the mountain . to beg her to devise some means by which she might get rid of her stepson . the fairy replied that , much as she desired to be agreeable to the queen in every way . it was impossible for her to attempt anything against the young prince .
strange to say , however , the allusion to her voice touched and pleased [female] more than anything else in the magpie 's speech . and this the cunning bird had fully expected , she knew cat nature well . which differs but little from human nature in this respect . that people very often fancy themselves to possess some talent or virtue . in which they are , as a matter of fact .
and the first thing the young man did when his beard was grown was to take the road to the dragon 's house and on the way he met a beggar . whom he persuaded to change clothes with him . and in the beggar 's garments he went fearlessly forth to the dragon . he found his enemy before his house . very busy making a box , and addressed him politely , good morning , your worship .
they were now in great trouble ; for the more they wandered . the deeper they went into the forest . night now fell , and there arose a high wind , which filled them with fear . they fancied they heard on every side the howling of wolves coming to devour them . they scarce dared to speak or turn their heads , then it rained very hard .
nightly he continued his exertions to approach the source of the delightful sounds he heard . till at length he had plowed out a wide and handsome channel . and so effected his passage from the river to the hill . a distance extending an arrow's flight , thither he repaired every night at the commencement of darkness . sure to meet the [male] who had become so necessary to his happiness , soon he began to speak of the pleasure he enjoyed .
`` we will , '' cried the other forks ; and as the dowagers did not object . all fell to work to arrange the table for this agreeable sport , [person] sat up to see how they would manage . and was astonished at the ingenuity of the silver people . with a great clinking and rattling they ran to and fro , dragging the stiff white [person] about . the largest they leaned up against the tall caster , and laid the rest in a long slope to the edge of the table .
the governor seemed to have imparted something strange and [female] . with respect to my person ; for i was treated this day with more suspicion and severity . for my justification , i appealed to the papers . which would be found in my room , but i was informed that search had been made and nothing found . thus , at the close of the court , vanished all my hope .
the troll wife now returned to her hut , and [female] crossed the water . and arrived safely at the king 's palace ; there he delivered the golden cloak . of which everyone said that a more sumptuous garment was never seen nor heard of . the king honorably kept his word with the youth . and gave him his young daughter to wife .
now he was in the courtyard of the hall . no stir was there of man or hound or horse . [male] dismounted and bade [male] be still , he opened a door and he saw a chamber with hangings on which was wrought the pattern of a great tree . a tree with three roots , and the pattern was carried across from one wall to the other . on a couch in the center of the chamber one lay in slumber .
as she spoke , a roaring hideous sound was heard that seemed to shake the ground and to fill all the air with terror . turning their heads , they beheld on their right a huge dragon . lying stretched upon the sunny side of a great hill , himself like a great hill . but no sooner did he see the shining armour of the knight than he roused himself and made ready for battle . hastily [organization] [female] withdraw herself to another hill .
so away went the duckling ; he floated on the water and ducked underneath it . but he was looked askance at by every living creature for his ugliness . now the autumn came on , the leaves in the woods turned yellow and brown . the wind took hold of them . and they danced about , the sky looked very cold , and the clouds hung heavy with snow and hail .
when the lady returned to her house she informed her husband of what had happened . and begged him to permit her to execute a stratagem that she had formed to punish their insolence . which would not only afford himself and her much laughable amusement , but solid advantage . as doubtless the lovers would each bring with him a handsome present . the husband , who knew he could trust the virtue of his wife .
the blinded giant now groped vainly round his cave in hopes of laying hands on some of his tormentors . but wearied at length of these fruitless exertions he rolled away the rock which closed the aperture . thinking that his victims would rush out with the sheep , when it would { 310 } be an easy matter to capture them . but in the meantime [male] had not been idle , and the subtlety of the hero was now brought into play . and proved more than a match for the giant 's strength .
now [male] had been kept informed by [male] of the prince 's adventures . and when she heard of the way in which he had been treated by the iron king she became furious . and began to prepare for war , she made her plans with all the secrecy she could . but when great armies are collected people are apt to suspect a storm is brewing . and of course it is very difficult to keep anything hidden from fairy godmothers .
his mother began to cry and wring her hands ; but the cow . surprised at the odd noise in her throat , opened her mouth and let [male] drop out . fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the ground . or he would have been dreadfully hurt , she then put [female] in her bosom and ran home with him . [male] 's father made him a whip of a barley straw to drive the cattle with .
where was the dwarf ? he had vanished , had he fallen off and been drowned ? what was that [male] of a metallic chuckle in the air ? [male] groaned and pressed his hands to his aching head . on which the yellow cap stuck fast , after a while he got up and looked about him . the river was much swollen , and was hurrying past its banks with such fury that it was useless to think of returning as he had come .
no mishap overtook them ; if they had stayed too late in the forest . and night came on , they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss . and slept until morning came , and their mother knew this and had no distress on their account . once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them . they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed .
he looked at the conjuror again and he saw he was no other than the enchanter of the black back lands . then it crossed his mind what the gobaun saor had said to him . he had seen a man he knew and a horse he had mounted before . he was to mount that horse , follow the man . and force him to tell the rest of the unique tale .
autumn came , and the starlings assembled on the thomaskirche . the storks in the village , and the swallows on the roof of the neighbour 's house to prepare for their flight towards the south . heavy storms tore the leaves from the trees . one dull rainy day followed another . and when at last the mountain ash berries and the barberries were shining in all their brightest scarlet .
when [female] came to the door of the church there was no one inside who could get a glimpse of her but was striving to know who she was . and when they saw her hurrying away at the end of mass . they ran out to overtake her , but no use in their running . she was away before any man could come near her . from the minute she left the church till she got home .
the most renowned heroes in [female] had sought the honour of her hand . but her stepfather , [male] , king of sparta . fearing that if he bestowed her in marriage on one of her numerous lovers he would make enemies of the rest . made it a stipulation that all suitors should solemnly swear to assist and defend the successful candidate . with all the means at their command , in any feud which might hereafter arise in connection with the marriage .
but [male] does not move , he is still and cold as the palace walls . little [female] bursts into tears . hot , scalding tears , her arms are yet round [female] 's neck . and her tears fall upon his heart of ice . they thaw it , they reach the grain of glass .
and even as he spoke to his wife the fume of the potion that [male] 's mother had given him was wearing off . and he had memories of going to the house of flame on a day that was not this day . and of riding through the wall of fire in his own shape . and again , as on the night when he drank the potion that queen [female] brewed . he became as one whose wits are astray , he stood watching his child as he played .
her husband told her that he had been to look for a [male] which he had seen on the previous day but he had not been able to find it . then his brother said that he had seen a [female] in its form that very morning but had not had time to shoot it . so they pretended to arrange to go and hunt this [female] and after having eaten their rice they drove out the cattle again . as they went along they kept close together with their arrows on the string . so that the [male] which came to stalk the younger brother got no opportunity to attack .
`` very well , '' said the little pig , but long before half past three the next day . piggy was off to the fair , and he took four bright silver pieces with him . for he wanted to buy himself a butter churn . it did not take him long to buy the churn . and then he started home again , carrying it on his back .
and with that he sent heralds throughout the kingdom to announce the news . and to ask if there were none among the common folk , the moujiks . the simple folk like us , who would put his hand to the work of rescuing the three lovely princesses . since not one of the boyars and wise men was willing to do it . now , at that time in a certain village lived a poor widow .
morgiana , while they were at supper . determined in her own mind to execute one of the boldest acts ever meditated , when [female] came for the dessert of fruit . and had put it with the wine and glasses before [female] . [female] retired , dressed herself neatly , with a suitable head dress like a dancer . girded her waist with a silver gilt girdle , to which there hung a poniard with a hilt and guard of the same metal .
and even as he spoke five more silent men with weapons ready came out of the bushes . and looked towards him for their orders . one of them held a large paper in his hand . the banker looked at him under lowering brows . red-faced and sulky , but seemingly cowed , that leap from the failing carriage seemed to have used up his last virility .
the journey lasted seven years , during which time the poor queen went through unspeakable pains and suffering . and if it had not been for the beautiful [female] , who was a great comfort to her . she would have died a hundred times over , this wonderful little creature could not open her mouth or say a word . without filling her mother with delight ; indeed , everybody , with the exception of the fairy lioness . was enchanted with her ; at last , when the queen had lived six years in this horrible place .
the prince was already at the door , but they knew nothing of it . people do not see far beyond the threshold , `` the day before yesterday our boy divided his bread and butter with her ! '' said the porter 's wife , there was neither cheese nor meat upon it . but she liked it as well as if it had been roast beef . there would have been a fine noise if the general and his wife had seen the feast .
a young farmer settled at a fine new farmhouse and a peasant 's daughter was placed there in charge of the dairy . the young farmer fell deeply in love with her and she with him . and he betrayed her under a promise of marriage . but his family refused to agree to the alliance taking place . and provided a bride for him suitable to his station .
so the prince [male] departed for the court of ratibouf . and on his way he met [male] . who was encamped with his army just outside the gates of bagota . the prince showed him the fairy 's written order that for the present peace must still be kept . and [male] , filled with longing to see [male] once more .
vincent in the meanwhile had changed his attitude completely toward the old masters . after his first meeting with [male] , his artistic sense had been singularly quickened . he might be seen almost daily wending his way , with a red covered baedeker under his arm . to the gate of a certain villa , where he would breathe the musty air of the deserted gallery for hours together . gaze abstractedly out of the windows , and sometimes , when he was observed , even make a pretence of sketching .
the gauntlet grasped the lance in its ten iron fingers . while the shield rested against the plates of the greaves as if to prove that prudence is necessary to courage . and that the best fighter is armed as well for defence as for attack . from among all these suits of armour [male] chose the one that honey bee 's father had worn as far away as the isles of [male] and [male] . he donned it with the aid of [male] .
there firm and instant closed the greedy womb . where wide born thousands met a common tomb , there still remains the curious parallel from [location] to which mrs. [female] has drawn attention . magic pipers are not unknown to english folk lore , as in the [male] ballad of the frere and the boy . or in the nursery rhyme of [male] son in its more extended form . but beguiling into a mountain is not known elsewhere except at [male] , which was made widely known in england by [male] 's and [male] 's accounts .
here a general battle was fought between the contending forces . in which the [male] were victorious , on his defeat the english king retired to hope [male] . from which he soon recommenced operations , and re occupied [male] without experiencing any opposition . from [male] he `` despatched a part of his army by sea to take possession of the isle of anglesey , '' and from thence , by means of a bridge of boats .
before long a man came over the fence and filled his arms with turnips . the lad drew his bow and shot . and the man fell , the lad returned home . and told what he had done ; and the [female] said that she was glad that the thief had perished . they then waited for the master 's return .
he was a hero of awful strength . nothing could resist him , he asked about his father . his mother told how his fathers had perished ( the brothers of a father are fathers too in the indian system ) . at the hands of the northeast brothers . `` i will go to avenge my fathers , '' said he , and started .
in a short time he reached the brook . filled his pitcher full of water , and turned back again , about half-way home . however , he was overcome with weariness , and setting down his pitcher . he lay down on the ground to sleep , but in order to awaken soon again by not lying too soft he had taken a horse 's skull which lay near and placed it under his head for a pillow . in the meanwhile the king 's daughter .
he could run faster , jump higher , solve a problem more quickly . and throw a ball farther than any other lad of his age . he was tall and straight and broad shouldered , his hair was brown and curly , and his eyes were sky color . sometimes blue , sometimes gray , sometimes almost black , all the boys liked [male] . especially [male] and [male] , his chums .
he would go for assistance , and , come what would , the princess should be delivered from that horrid tower . he therefore arose , and , without reflecting how he was to leave this abode of wickedness . he prepared to return to his friend and adviser [male] . when he reached the aperture by which he had entered the hollow mountain ( which he did without meeting any one ) . he found it closed by a gate of brass .
one sunday the king had a high fir pole erected in front of the church . and a golden rosemary tied to the top , and promised his daughter to him who should be able to take it down in one jump on horseback . all the knights of the realm tried their fortune . but not one of them was able to jump high enough , but all of a sudden a knight clad in copper mail . on a copper horse , appeared with his visor down .
the hog is ceremonially killed by cutting its throat , not by `` sticking , '' as is the [location] custom , but the neck is cut . half severing the head , at ambuklao . on the agno river in benguet province . i saw a hog ceremonially killed by having a round pointed stick an inch in diameter pushed and twisted into it from the right side behind the foreleg .
he could make himself invisible , or could assume the shape of birds and beasts . grasses , flowers , snakes and fishes . as he chose , he also knew how to empty out seas and remove mountains from one place to another . so he went to the wu i hills and rescued his mother . whom he took on his back and carried away , they stopped to rest on a flat ledge of rock .

i expected a sharp reply from the sister . but , instead of this , she turned laughingly to her father , and said . in a very loud stage whisper , `` to be a bride , '' the father . in order to do his part in a conversation that seemed only fit for lunatics . replied `` whisper it to me , dear , '' but she did not whisper ( these children never did anything they were told ) .
it is no easier to attempt to explain such an apparition than it is to say why [male] . the `` bad lord lonsdale , '' was said to dash about in his phantom coach and six after his death . another member of a noble family was responsible for bringing trouble on his house through his wicked ways . the lambtons were haunted for nine generations by a horrible snake or worm which brought much evil in its train . one day the heir to the estate .
on christmas [person] the city throbbed with the clank of arms and the tramp of the great retinues of princes . kings and powerful lords who had come at the archbishop 's summons . and by day and night the narrow ways were crowded with armed men . long ere the dawn of christmas day . the lords and the common people betook themselves along the wide road which led across to the church .
such excursions fill the mind with beautiful fancies and help to develop that most precious of our faculties , the imagination . there was never in the whole world a more mischievous busybody than that notorious giant [male] . he was everywhere , in season and out of season . running about , and putting his hand in whatever was going forward , to carry on his game he could take almost any shape he pleased . he could be very foolish or very wise , very weak or very strong , very rich or very poor just as happened to suit his humor best .
by this time it had grown quite dusk . they were now come to a very wild and desert place , overgrown with shaggy bushes . and so silent and solitary that nobody seemed ever to have dwelt or journeyed there . all was waste and desolate , in the gray twilight . which grew every moment more obscure , [male] looked about him .
lad , [male] traces a resemblance between this tale and one in [male] 's pantschatantra . where it is related how a poor brahmin , in reward for his long penitence . has his bones thrown into the sacred waters of the ganges . there is a curious finnish story which resembles this tale , `` ennustukset '' . from ilomantsi in s , [male] . 64 72 .
in the evenings , when the purple twilight fell upon [female] . [female] would take up a position at the end of the great bridge . and there , sooner or later , he would accost a stranger . pressing upon him a warm invitation to spend the night under his roof . and promising him the best of entertainment , indeed , being of a gay and merry disposition .
then word was brought him of the daylong dreadful battle in the west . and how king [male] was gone , mortally wounded , none knew whither . and how all the knights of the round table were dead . [male] was sir [male] at this news . but men saw how his stern face paled ; and for a time he walked apart and would suffer none to speak to him .
pretty cock , pretty hen , and you . pretty brindled cow , what do you say now ? the beasts answered . `` duks , '' and everything happened as on the former day . the girl cooked a good meal , ate and drank with the old man . and did not trouble herself about the animals .
then each dwarf fixed a [male] in his sling . and at a word from their chief they all drew back their arms and launched a shower of the sharp missiles at the strangers . swift and true they sped , each [male] intended to pierce the body of the youthful knight who stood so calm before them . prince marvel had raised his right arm . and in his hand was a small leather sack .
we have already learnt from the life of a [person] that plants can make better and stronger seeds when they can get pollen dust from another plant . than when they are obliged to use that which grows in the same flower ; but i am sure you will be very much surprised to hear that the more we study flowers the more we find that their colours . their scent , and their curious shapes are all so many baits and traps set by nature to entice insects to come to the flowers . and carry this pollen dust from one to the other , so far as we know . it is entirely for this purpose that the plants form honey in different parts of the flower .
cat , the more meat you had . good body , good body , the more meat you had , good body , [person] . i put it in the window to cool . my lady , i put it in the window to cool , cat . the faster you would eat it .
george 's first impulse was to thrust his spade right through the body of the squire . but as the difficulties of this enterprise seemed insuperable , he fell back upon an easier course of action . which was to turn his face against a big tree and weep copiously . in the meanwhile , [female] took good care to keep her tears flowing by digging her fists into her eyes . and , in her despair , she flattened her nose against the trunk of a neighbouring tree .
which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn . designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty [male] the third . here they used to sit in the shade through a long lazy summer 's day . talking listlessly over village gossip , or telling endless . sleepy stories about nothing , but it would have been worth any statesman 's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place .
the hawk flew towards him and lighted on his shoulder . [male] held the white grouse to her breast . the man came near to her and spoke to her and his voice made her stand . he wore the dress of a hunter . his face was brown and lean and his eyes were bright blue like gentian flowers .
but the lad importuned the king again and again until he gave him permission to go . the lad , taking his bow and arrow . came to the tree , during the critical night when the apple would ripen he felt that a heavy sleep was taking possession of his senses . to prevent it , however , he wounded one of his little fingers and put salt on the wound . and the sharp pain did not let him sleep , in the middle of the night .
by selling these she saved enough money to buy goats and sheep . and in course of time was able to think of buying a cow . early one morning they set out , enquiring as they went along whether any one had a cow for sale . for a long time they were unsuccessful but after passing right through the territories of one raja . they at length came to a village where they heard of a heifer for sale .
then there were the fairies , the guardians of mankind . who were much interested in the adoption of [female] because their own laws forbade them to become familiar with their human charges . there are instances on record where the fairies have shown themselves to human beings . and have even conversed with them ; but they are supposed to guard the lives of mankind unseen and unknown . and if they favor some people more than others it is because these have won such distinction fairly .
the cat was as good as her word , as soon as she returned from her drive she trotted off to the forest to consult a fairy who dwelt there . and very soon after the queen had a little girl , who seemed made out of snow and sunbeams . the queen was delighted , and soon the baby began to take notice of the kitten as she jumped about the room . and would not go to sleep at all unless the kitten lay curled up beside her . years passed away , and one day , when the princess was playing ball in the garden .
fresh roses were scattered over her , the delicate folded hands and the noble face glorified in death by the solemn . earnest look , which spoke of an entrance into a better world . were alone visible , around the coffin stood the husband and children . a whole troop , the youngest in the father 's arms . they were come to take a last farewell look of their mother .
the monkey never forgot the tree 's long hard name and the little tune he had sung . nor did he forget how the fruit tasted , he never took a bite of it again . but , after that , his favourite trick was to treat the other beasts to the wonderful fruit just to see them make faces when they tasted it . once upon a time the [male] sent an invitation to the goat asking the goat to accompany him on a visit . the goat promptly accepted the invitation and at the appointed day they started on their journey to the house of the [male] 's friend .
mahbracca , stupefied for a moment at her utter discomfiture . and deserted by her followers , stood gazing blankly at the scene , what she intended doing next . was not long doubtful ; for , taking a magical wand from her pocket , she bade the giant . with a wave of her wand , turn into a camelopard . as he did not seem in a hurry to obey , she commanded him to become a hippopotamus .
at last , when they had all but given it up , just as the sun rose . the prince opened his eyes , the princess burst into a passion of tears and fell on the floor . there she lay for an hour , and her tears never ceased . all the pent up crying of her life was spent now , and a rain came on . such as had never been seen in that country , the sun shone all the time .
ah , sighed his wife , if we had but only one . and were he no bigger than my [male] , i should still be content . and love him with all my heart , a little while after the wife fell ill . and after seven months a child was born , who , although he was perfectly formed in all his limbs . was not actually bigger than one 's [male] , so they said to one another that it had happened just as they wished .
it chanced one day that when they were resting in the noontide heat . under the perfumed shade of a hawthorn in bloom . they saw on the edge of the meadow . spread out before them , a speckled thrush cowering in the grass . [male] looked up , and he saw the hawk with quivering wings .
king lear folded his arms ( to the imminent peril of his beard ) . and said , in a mild explanatory tone , `` ay , every inch a king ! '' and then paused , as if to consider how this could best be proved , and here . with all possible deference to [male] as a shakespearian critic . i must express my opinion that the poet did not mean his three great tragic heroes to be so strangely alike in their personal habits .
and the counts of carrion , with treason in their hearts . promised that all honour should await their brides , eight days hence . the procession passed out of the city gates . and the cid went first , with doña [male] on his right hand . and doña sol on his left , for the space of a league he rode .
he looked round , and behold -- it was the glassmanikin . he flew at once into a furious passion , bewailing his bad luck and cursing the little man as the cause of all his misfortune . `` what am i to do now with my horses and carts ? '' he said . of what use to me is my factory and all my glass ? even when i was a miserable charcoal burner , i was happier .
on he went at full gallop , still galloping on and on , a knight with a gleaming plume . and most magnificently dressed , held him before him on the horse . and thus they rode through the wood to the old town of [organization] . and that was a large and very lively town , high towers rose from the castle of the king . and the brightness of many candles streamed from all the windows .
`` then throw the looking glass on the ground , '' said the horse . so the prince threw it ; and when the magician came up . the roan horse stepped on the mirror , and crash ! his foot went through the glass , and he stumbled and fell . cutting his feet so badly that there was nothing for the old man to do but to go slowly back with him to the stables .
consider that he who kills shall be killed , that you will stain your reputation . and lose the esteem of mankind , what will not the world say of such a bloody rage ? she spoke these words in such a taking away , accompanied with tears . that she gained upon him at last , well , then , says he to his nurse . for your sake i will spare her life .
said the crow , `` my blessings on ye , then , '' said [male] , `` but it 's the good advice you have , '' and he took the red clay and the daub that was by the brink . and he rubbed it to the bottom of the sieve . until all the holes were filled , and then the sieve held the water .
in the center of the room there was a rough wooden table . over against the wall , near the door which opened to the highway . stood a grandfather 's clock , ticking severely , as if it were dissatisfied with the way things were going in the house . there were a number of other doors visible , all closed as if they were saying . `` this is an orderly house , and everybody has gone to bed , of course ! ''
after that , he laid him down on the bench to sleep . and began to snore so , that it sounded like thunder on the hills . so the mastermaid took a knife and cut the prince in his little finger . and let three drops of blood fall on a three-legged stool . and after that she took all the old rags , and soles of shoes .
bronze limbed and well knit , like a statue wrought by a grecian , he stood on the sand with his back to the moon . and out of the foam came white arms that beckoned to him . and out of the waves rose dim forms that did him homage . before him lay his shadow , which was the body of his soul . and behind him hung the moon in the honey coloured air .
when they arrived they were shocked to find the little cabin in flames . they went to the parsonage and there they learned that a railroad workman had seen their father at malmberget . far up in lapland , he had been working in a mine and possibly was still there . when the clergyman heard that the children wanted to go in search of their father he brought forth a map and showed them how far it was to malmberget and tried to dissuade them from making the journey . but the children insisted that they must find their father .
`` well , i wish i could find the door of that cupboard , '' said his mother , but the same moment she stopped . and was silent for a good while , i can not tell whether diamond knew what she was thinking . but i think i know , she had heard something at church the day before . which came back upon her -- something like this , that she had not to eat for tomorrow as well as for today .
`` oh , oh , look , '' tiny laughed so that the woods echoed . and no wonder she did -- for just at her feet lay the tiniest little bit of a town with real houses . no bigger than bird houses ; real people , too , not much taller than pins . real street lamps no bigger than pencils ; real carts no bigger than peanuts . real horses no bigger than katydids , in the center of the town was a lovely little fountain .
to this the weaver agreed ; and shortly afterwards the rajah called him and enquired if he was willing to help him . and , as promised , the man replied , `` yes , i will , '' then he went to his wife and told her . and she commended him , next day the king told him that two brothers . by name `` darya '' and `` barjo , '' threatened to fight and take his kingdom from him , and he desired his son in law to go to the stables and select a horse on which to ride on the morrow to battle .
a civilization founded upon unrestricted competition therefore seemed to him necessarily feeble in appreciation of the beautiful . and unequal to its creation , in this way loyalty to his mission bred apparent disloyalty . delightful discourses upon art gave way to fervid pleas for humanity . for the rest of his life he became a very earnest . if not always very wise , social reformer and a passionate pleader for what he believed to be true economic ideals .
thereupon the squire drew him out , and [male] tsarevich took a piece of paper . wrote the writing , and gave it to the squire . then he took off his own cloak , and exchanged it for the squire 's . and they went on their way , after some days they came to the kingdom of the tsar [male] . and when the tsar heard of the arrival of [male] tsarevich he went out to meet him .
next moment he was across the river and beside the witch 's house . it was evening , and the door was locked , but he knew the way down the chimney . when he had got into the house , however , the worst yet remained to do . for the coverlet was on the bed in which the witch lay and slept . he slipped into the room without either she or her daughter wakening .
among other things , this poor child was forced twice a day to draw water above a mile and a half off the house . and bring home a pitcher full of it , one day . as she was at this fountain , there came to her a poor woman . who begged of her to let her drink , o ay . with all my heart , [female] , said this pretty maid .
an overwhelming sense of compassion came over me . as for one who had sustained a mortal hurt that was beyond the power of healing . alas , that simplicity and uprightness of soul . and the boasted womanly intuitions , should be such poor safeguards against the wiles of the serpent ! and yet , i knew that to argue with her at this moment would be worse than vain .
next morning , at sunrise , when the son entered his father 's room . as was his daily custom , he found him lying upon his bed . dead , but [female] to say , dressed in a woman 's clothes . that the death was not accidental could be seen at a glance , the body lay prepared as if for a funeral . the clothes and the dressing of the hair .
after this she was quite comforted and happy , till the next month was passed . and then she had a child as white as snow and as red as blood . when she beheld it , she was so glad . that she died , her husband buried her under the juniper tree . and began to mourn very much ; but after a little time , he became calmer .
or [female] , or the white hawk , lived in a remote part of the forest . where animals abounded , every day he returned from the chase with a large spoil . for he was one of the most skilful and lucky hunters of his tribe . his form was like the cedar ; the fire of youth beamed from his eye . there was no forest too gloomy for him to penetrate , and no track made by bird or beast of any kind which he could not readily follow .
and the goats , too , said farewell and cried : `` mit , mit , mah ! '' and that was so sad , there were two [female] guides in the neighbourhood . and they were about to cross the mountains ; they were to descend to the other side of the gemmi . and [male] followed them on foot . this was a severe march for such a little chap , but he had strength and courage .
she clapped her hands with delight . and up rose such a flapping of wings , again she stopped her spinning . she rose , took the princess by the hand . led her out of the room , and opened the door opposite the stair . the princess expected to see a lot of hens and chickens .
[male] was afterwards in [location] . and the son of the king was his foster son , one day . as they were out hunting , [male] and his foster son happened to be separated from the rest of the party . when a wild boar appeared before them ; [male] ran at him with his spear . but the beast caught it in his mouth and broke it across .
then the artificial bird had to sing alone , it was just as great a success as the real one . and then it was so much prettier to look at ; it glittered like bracelets and breast pins . it sang the same tune three and thirty times over . and yet it was not tired ; people would willingly have heard it from the beginning again . but the emperor said that the real one must have a turn now .
but [male] kisses his white cheeks , and they grow rosy . she kisses his eyes , and they shine like stars . she kisses his hands and feet . and he is strong and glad , hand in hand they wander out of the ice palace . the winds hush , the sun bursts forth .
the sultan then commanded the drums , trumpets , cymbals . and other instruments of music to announce his joy to the public . and a festival of ten days to be proclaimed for the return of the princess and [female] . within a few years afterward , the sultan died in a good old age . and as he left no male children , the princess [male] .
but should there be a prospect of your husband often meeting with this lady in question . endeavour at once to break off the intimacy by bringing forward some pretext consistent with truth ( for to truth everything must be sacrificed ) . such as , you do not like her ; the intimacy is not what you would wish . and [female] , however , avow the real reason : it will only produce discord . and make your husband think you prone to jealousy -- a suspicion a woman can not too carefully guard against .
never a word more would she utter , and the poor prince would puzzle himself about how he could reach the princess . but he continued his search , he would often go to the spot where his beloved had disappeared . a stately tree , as slender as the princess , had sprung up there , its waving green branches swayed gently . and stretched out with delicate , tender leaves . its trunk wore the white and silver dress of the moon [male] .
on the way they met the children . still playing round their snow man ; and the snowballs with which they pelted them in the back were very real . but there again , the snowballs might have belonged to the dream , but when they were inside the house . and saw the inglenook , with the soup in the pot by the fire and the bundle of wood near by . and everything just as they had left it .
think of the soothing , contented [female] of the bees in the early summer . when they are sipping the sweetest honey from their favourite flowers . think of the softest murmuring of the sea waves when they gently break upon the shore . and lovingly kiss the rocks against which , in their hours of anger . they dash so madly ; think again , of the blessed sound of distant church bells heard across the water as you stand listening upon a silent summer 's [female] .
in a short time the two elder brothers came home . and their mother asked to see the linen which had been woven out of the skeins of flax she had given them . they all three left the room ; and in a few minutes the two eldest returned . bringing with them the linen that had been spun by their chosen wives . but the youngest brother was greatly troubled , for he had nothing to show for the skein of flax that had been given to him .
the following story was told to [female] and happened at a country house on the plateau of the garde near to toulon . one evening a woman was sitting by the side of her father who had been lying dangerously ill in bed for some days with a disease which the doctors could not identify . the neighbours came in to offer their services , to keep watch over the sick man so that his daughter . who had spent several nights without any sleep , could go and lie down to rest . she thanked them but refused to do so , nevertheless they insisted on remaining .
it was , as i have said , a fine autumnal day . the sky was clear and serene , and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always associate with the idea of abundance . the forests had put on their sober brown and yellow . while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange . purple , and scarlet , streaming files of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the air .
one day he had climbed his tree to pick a loaf when an old woman came by with a bag over her shoulder and saying that she was very poor begged for a piece of bread . the old woman was really a rakshasi , the boy was kindhearted and told her that he would throw her down a loaf . but the old woman objected that it would get dirty if it fell on the ground . then he told her to hold out her cloth and he would throw it into that . but she said that she could not see well enough to catch the loaf .
the mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the following sunday . knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the churchyard . at the bridge , and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin had been found . the stories of brouwer , of bones . and a whole budget of others were called to mind ; and when they had diligently considered them all .
what intensified and complicated his doubts most , was the sea lady 's subsequent serene freedom from allusion to anything that might or might not have passed . she behaved just as she had always behaved ; neither an added intimacy nor that distance that follows indiscreet confidences appeared in her manner . and amidst this crop of questions arose presently quite a new set of doubts . as if he were not already sufficiently equipped , the sea lady alleged she had come to the world that lives on land , for [male] . he had not hitherto looked ahead to see precisely what would happen to [female] , to miss [female] .
[female] 's mother was very glad to get the money . but she did not like him to run any risk for her . but after a time [male] made up his mind to go again to the giant 's castle . so he climbed the beanstalk once more , and blew the horn at the giant 's gate . the giantess soon opened the door ; she was very stupid .
on the contrary , his employment placed him at the head of the grandest people of the town . and it was his place by right . he had to precede the bishop , and even the princes of the blood . he always went first , -- he was a hearse driver ! there , now , the truth is out , and i will own , that when people saw my father perched up in front of the omnibus of death .
we can not escape it if he does not take pity on us . at these words he ordered the sails to be changed . but all the ropes broke and the ship , without its being possible to help it . was carried by the current to the foot of an inaccessible mountain , where she ran ashore . and was broken to pieces , yet so that we saved our lives .
he sees the giant , curling smoke . rise stealthily from his lurking places , sees him grow vaster . and vaster , until , when he chooses he darkens all the sky . but of him , also , he is unafraid , the ash goblin creeps forth from his low dwelling . prying into the affairs of others and seeking what mischief he may do .
there were lights in all directions -- lanterns no bigger than foxgloves were hanging in rows . and on the booths , rushlights in tulip cups shone among fairy goodies such as [female] had never dreamed of . yet with all these lights there was such a shimmer over everything that she got bewildered . and could not see as plainly as she wished , she did not care to disturb the little people until she had looked at all that was doing . so she crept softly behind the booths and watched the spriggans dancing .
so now the wretch went for the third time to the house door . knocked at it and said : open the door for me . children , your dear little mother has come home . and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her . the little kids cried : `` first show [location] your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother . ''
and as he lay under the spreading branches . watching the stars glancing through the leaves , and listening to the slumb'rous [male] of the waters . a strange peace came over him , but in the camp which he had left . and in the vast multitude on the plains of [male] . there was stir and revelry , and babbling speculation as to the contest of tomorrow .
[female] head abashed ; then , in a voice broken with emotion . he begged that at least he should be given a memento of his visit . the angel handed him the skull . saying : `` take this and ponder o'er its meaning , '' the skull was so heavy that . with all his great strength , [male] could scarcely carry it .
[female] 's mother shrank back , and it was well she did so . for just as the giant took hold of the last branch of the beanstalk . [female] cut the stem quite through and darted from the spot . down came the giant with a terrible crash , and as he fell on his head . he broke his neck , and lay dead at the feet of the woman he had so much injured .
it did not take grasshopper a long time to resolve what he should do . he immediately resumed power in the village . bestowed a sound cudgeling upon the bears , and sent them off to live in the mountains among their own people . as bears should ; restored to his people all their rights . gave them plenty to eat and drink ; exerting his great strength in hunting .
thus it came about that the [female] , useless , untidy little girls hated the very name of the widow 's daughter . because they were always being told of her usefulness and neatness , now the widow 's child often earned a few pence by herding sheep or pigs for the farmers . or by darning stockings for their wives , and as she could be trusted . people were very glad to employ her , one day she was keeping watch over five little pigs in a field . and , not to waste time , was darning a pair of stockings as well .
for they were all persuaded nobody knew their secret , little imagining that [male] had watched them . it was a matter of the greatest importance to them to secure their riches . they agreed therefore to cut [male] 's body into four quarters . to hang two on one side and two on the other , within the door of the cave . to terrify any person who should attempt the same thing , determining not to return to the cave till the stench of the body was completely exhaled .
at last the [female] loomed to south east , soon a game of pitch and toss precluded our access to harbor . at last we transshipped , all three of us , boy and dog and i . to a steam launch , and were soon ashore , no , i wo not say four of us . the presence did not make itself felt as taking a share in that scramble of ours . i was rather surprised at missing its company , when i found time to think about it .
he put on a lady 's gay silk kimono and wrapped himself around with golden embroidery . then he danced and played the game of the ka gu' ra . or lion of [location] , pretending to make love to a girl oni , such funny capers as he did cut ! it would have made a cat laugh to see him . it was broad daylight , before his pranks were over .
out of the palace gates he rode and he wore his crown . and his eyes were more brilliant than the jewels in it . and his smile was more radiant than a sunrise as he looked about him . for every breath he drew in was fragrant , every ugly place was hidden . and every squalid corner filled with beauty , for it seemed as if the whole world were waving with blue flowers .
miss [female] is one of the women sculptors who have been selected to share in the decoration of the buildings for thelouis exposition . she is to make two reclining figures on the pediment over the main entrance to the liberal arts building . she has in her studio two reclining figures which will probably serve to fulfil this commission . miss [female] is modest about her work and does not care to talk much about this important commission . even suggesting that her design may not be accepted ; if she is successful it will certainly be an unusual honor for a woman at her age .
they ascended the woody side of the hill by a tortuous path . here and there blocks of [male] , bare and rusty . rose in the grey foliage of the dwarf oaks . and the rugged landscape was enclosed by russet hills and their blue grey ravines . the procession , preceded by [male] on his winged steed .
the duel thus insolently provoked was to be fought with pistols within the ruins ofruth . and as [male] and his second came near the place of combat . they heard no sound save their own voices mingling with those of the sheep bleating peacefully to each other upon the opposite hill . on the stump of an old [male] tree within the ruins sat the venerable figure of old [male] ochiltree . [male] had a message to deliver , he told [male] that he had been at the sheriff 's that very day .
here was life and bustle indeed , the mill wheels went round ; large beams were sawn through . the iron forged on the anvil , and all by water power , the houses of the workmen form a whole town . it is a long street with red painted wooden houses . under picturesque oaks , and [male] trees . the greensward was as soft as velvet to look at , and up at the manor house .
worth of [person] pepper . and put it into a pepper duster , scatter the [person] along the boards and joist where you have had the long sheet net . and also along the other end of the joist where you put the ferrets in . and you will find that under no consideration will rats face the [person] pepper . [person] is alright for any dry place and will last a long time .
but , as the enchanter had vanished , he did not waste any more time in thinking . but went to seek the princess , who very soon consented to marry him , but after all . they had not been married very long when the king died , and the queen had nothing left to care for but her little son . who was called [male] , the little prince had large blue eyes . the prettiest eyes in the world , and a sweet little mouth .
at last he tried hunting , and spent whole days in the forest . one day as he was thus engaged he followed a stag . and got deeper and deeper into the thick part of the wood ; in the meantime the sun had set and darkness set in . the prince , having gone too far , could not find his way back , but as good luck would have it he saw a small cottage . and started in its direction to find a night 's lodging .
but they could have given her nothing that would have pleased her more , she continued her task with joy and prayed for help . while the street boys sang jeering songs about her and not a soul comforted her with a kind word . toward evening she heard at the grating the [female] of a [female] 's wing . it was her youngest brother . he had found his sister , and she sobbed for joy .
taken by surprise , she could hardly realize that it was her own dear father who was calling her . and for a moment she was utterly bereft of the power to speak or move . my father , my father , it is indeed you . oh , my father , was all she could say , and running to him she caught hold of his thick sleeve . and burying her face burst into a passion of tears .
the chief of the officers went to [male] 's mother . and at a sign he gave her . she followed him to the foot of the sultan 's throne . where he left her , and retired to his place by the grand vizier . the old woman bowed her head down to the carpet .
thus [female] became celebrated by her piety and goodness . then came [female] 's father and mother to visit her . and brought her three rings , saying their cook had bought a fish . inside which these rings were found ; but , as they had given them to their son [male] . they feared that he had been drowned at sea .
per gynt skinned the bear , and buried his body among the bowlders . but the head and skin he took with him . on the way back he met a mountain fox . `` see , my little lamb , how fat you are ! '' rang out from one hill , `` just see how high [male] carries his firelock ! ''
at last they reached an open square , and there was the greatest crowd of all . on a raised platform covered with silver cloth , and with steps leading up to it . were two thrones ; upon one of the thrones sat a tall , fierce looking man dressed in black velvet . and with a crown upon his head cut entirely from one great black diamond . upon the other throne sat a beautiful young princess , she was as pale as a [female] and as beautiful as the day .
when feetgong heard his master calling he stopped and stood stockstill . but [male] whipped out the dried windpipe of the goose and blew upon it . and away went feetgong like the wind ; none could go faster , no one could overtake them . after a while , and not so long either , they came to the seashore . and there , a little way out from the shore , lay the king 's own boat with the boatman in it .
at this critical moment the bride gave a third sneeze . and [male] roared out with all his might , `` god save us ! '' whether this exclamation resulted from his soliloquy , or from the mere force of habit . he never could tell exactly himself ; but no sooner was it uttered than the little man . his face glowing with rage and disappointment .
she walked straight along the road in front of her . without knowing very well where she was going or what was to become of her . for she had never been shown how to work , and all she had learnt consisted of a few household rules . and receipts of dishes which her mother had taught her long ago . and as she was afraid that no housewife would want to engage a girl with such a pretty face .
our fat , old [female] sweats and blows . she does not see how near he stands , and when she bangs the door , good lands , it most cuts off his nose , once upon a time there was a king who was the wisest in all of the world . so wise was he that no one had ever befooled him . which is a rare thing , i can tell you .
mme , le brun had one habit with which she allowed nothing to interfere . which was taking a rest after her work for the day was done . she called it her `` calm , '' and to it she attributed a large share of her power of endurance . although it lost her many pleasures .
bamboo , not yet fully awake , stumbled out of the tablet room . and his father locked the iron doors . [female] was a little slave girl , she had been sold by her father when she was scarcely more than a baby . and had lived for five years with a number of other children in a wretched houseboat . her cruel master treated her very badly , he made her go out upon the street .
this time the brownies were successful , and they pulled [male] to the brink . and rolled him over to a place of temporary safety . water poured from his drenched form , and with a groan he relapsed into unconsciousness . soon [male] would revive , and then what would happen ? they had saved their foe . but to what purpose ? if by any chance they should escape the present dreadful danger they were in they would still be in the wicked enchanter 's power .
then the giant laughed with glee and rubbed his hands saying . `` i have got the right one at last , '' so he took nix naught nothing to his own house under the whirlpools . for the giant was really a great magician who could take any form he chose . and the reason he wanted a little prince so badly was that he had lost his wife . and had only one little daughter who needed a playmate sorely , so nix naught nothing and the magician 's daughter grew up together .
little [female] sobbed again and stumbled in the snow , which was drifting deeper and deeper upon the mountain side . this was the stormiest christmas [female] which had been seen for years . and all the little boys who had good homes were hugging themselves close to the fire . glad that they were not out in the bleak night , every window was full of flickering tapers to light the expected holy child upon his way through the village to the church . but little [male] had strayed so far from the road that he could not see these rows and rows of tiny earth stars .
now , when they had been to many palaces , and seen many princesses . they came to a king who had six daughters . such lovely king 's daughters they had never seen . and so they asked them to be their brides . and when they had got them , they set off home again .
growing more and more restless and impatient , he finally rose a little in his place of concealment and thrust out his head far enough to see not only the expanse of the plain and the path up the cliff-side . but the entrance to the cave of darkness as well . what was his astonishment to see two figures standing before it—one of them the grey robed shadow witch . whom he knew well , the other a stranger , and clad in those ruddy garments by which black shadow had declared he might recognize prince [male] . he could scarcely believe it to be possible that the shadow witch had escaped from her brother—that the prince had crossed the plain under his very eyes unseen .
other friends went , too , they packed their goods in large waggons drawn by oxen . it was quite a little company , they started on their journey in february . the roads were heavy with frost and mud . there were no bridges , and so the streams must be forded , again and again they had to break the ice to let the wheels pass . at one of these fords a little dog was left behind on the farther shore .
then [female] appeared , with floating hair and resonant voice . and beside her [female] with his four steeds , frowning sullenly , he struck them sharply with his lash . which whistled through the air , and angrily thrust his trident deep into the sea . instantly the waves took hues of lighter brown . deeper yellow , and cloudy gray .
this trait connects her with [female] , and the three sister [female] yagas with the three gorgones . the russian [female] 's method of petrifaction is singular . in the story referred to , [female] dévich meets a [female] . who plucks one of her hairs , gives it to him . and says , `` tie three knots and then blow , '' he does so .
but the princess was very [female] and meek , so she said nothing to her maid 's ill behavior . but got upon her horse again , and as she leaned down to drink , the lock of hair fell from her bosom and floated away with the water . now she was so frightened that she did not see it . but her maid saw it and was very glad . for she knew the charm ; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power .
but it was not so soon done , either , it lay in the usual place . the carrier 's dreadnought pocket . with the little pouch , her own work ; from which she was used to fill it . but her hand shook so , that she entangled it ( and yet her hand was small enough to have come out easily . i am sure ) , and bungled terribly , the filling of the pipe and lighting it .
since you are so kind as to think of me . dear father , '' she answered , `` i should be glad if you would bring me a rose . for we have none in our garden , now beauty did not indeed wish for a rose . nor anything else , but she only said this that she might not affront her sisters . otherwise they would have said she wanted her father to praise her for desiring nothing .

when the woman and her companions had thus driven a while . they came to a splendid castle , and the gentleman in black led them up the steps . above , in the great hall , the woman laid off her costly garments and put on a coarse coat and wooden shoes . then he combed her hair three times . till she could no longer bear it .
the door of the palace was shut , and knocking loudly he cried . `` open to [male] muhammed , '' the [male] 's reputation was well-known . and no one ever arrived at the palace who was not brave enough to risk being turned into an animal . in a moment the door was opened and [female] was invited to step inside . [female] stood stupefied in wonder at this vision of paradise .
ferko continued his way till he came to a ploughed field . here he noticed a little mouse creeping wearily along on its hind paws . for its front paws had both been broken in a trap , [male] felt so sorry for the little beast that he spoke to it in the most friendly manner . and washed its small paws with the healing water . in a moment the mouse was sound and whole , and after thanking the kind physician it scampered away over the ploughed furrows .
the stepmother and the stepsisters were ready to burst with rage and envy . they could not believe their eyes , and would have sent [female] back to the kitchen with harsh words and blows . but this the messenger would not allow , [female] was taken away to the palace and dressed as a princess should be . and when the prince saw her again in all her beauty he was filled with love and joy . he then brought out a lump of gold as big as [male] 's head and gave it to the lad .
all day the king 's son was going . traveling through wood and waste until the coming on of night . the little fluttering birds were going from the [male] tops . from tuft to tuft , and to the briar roots , going to rest ; but if they were . he was not , till the night came on , blind and dark .
she said to the king that she did not like the others coming to ask him to stay his crying . for nothing was more just than that he should cry over the loss of a good wife . and that as for her , who once had the very best of husbands , and had lost him . she would cry for him as long as she had eyes in her head to cry with . and immediately she let out and redoubled her sobs .
walter gave but one touch to unwind the string . and up , up it mounted like the parzival airship . bearing the little boy with it , who held tight to the end of the cord . he felt rather giddy and frightened at first , but soon found out that by holding the cord in his hands to give him confidence . and making movements in the air , similar to those of swimming .
in 1897 mr. [female] was appointed [location] minister to belgium . and mrs. [female] took a japanese artist . [female] , to [location] , to instruct her in bronze work . two years later mr.

i stood till they passed through the long shadow of the college . and turned up nicholson street , i heard the solitary cart sound through the streets . and die away and come again ; and i returned , thinking of that company going up libberton brae . then along roslin muir , the morning light touching the pentlands and making them like on looking ghosts . then down the hill through auchindinny woods , past haunted woodhouselee ', .
`` yes , i hear how it ticks , '' cried [male] , and ran no farther . he understood that the elk did not want him to follow . but to take notice of something that was happening in the forest . [male] was standing beneath the drooping branches of a great pine . he looked carefully at it ; the needles moved .
the president declared that no one could be better fitted for the task than he who had given such excellent advice . but at that the young mouse became quite confused and stammered an excuse , he was too young for the deed , he said , he didn t know the cat well enough , his grandfather . who knew her better , would be more suited to the job , but the grandfather declared that just because he knew the cat very well he would take good care not to attempt such a task . and the long and the short of it was that no other mouse would undertake the duty .
prince [male] thanked the king in the most humble expressions . that he might the better show his gratitude , as for my profession . said he , i must own i am not an astrologer . as your majesty very judiciously observed ; i only put on the habit of one . that i might succeed more easily in my ambition to be allied to the most potent monarch in the world .
the ten ships chased [female] 's vessel two whole days without seeing her . the third day in the morning they discovered her . and at noon had so surrounded her , that she could not escape . prince [male] being an expert swimmer . made such good use of his feet and hands .
as i have already said , everyone in the kingdom knew the conditions before the day arrived . and many and various were the speculations as to the result , at last the sun shone upon the eventful morning of the day which was to decide the issue of the race and the fate of [person] . from every quarter people came hurrying into the town . carts , carriages and vehicles of every description and size thronged the roads . which were also crowded with foot passengers , all dressed in holiday garments .
i will tell you what i know of the girl , ', said [male] . then he told the fisherman that around midsummer time , two strange children . a boy and a girl -- had come to the mines to look for their father . but as their father was away , they had stayed to await his return . while there , the boy had been killed by a blast of rock .
they were to arrange for him to do so ; and so they did . the little toy theater was therefore put up in such a way that the money pig could look directly into it . some wanted to begin with a comedy , and afterward to have a tea party and a discussion for mental improvement . but they commenced with the latter first , the rocking horse spoke of training and races . the wagon , of railways and steam power .
the court was then dismissed , all wondering at this [male] decree . and the prince returned to his own apartment where his [male] . [male] , anxiously awaited him , now this [male] was a man of good heart and much intelligence . but wholly unused to the ways of the world , he had lately noted . with much grief , the number of beggars who solicited alms as he walked out with the prince .
he toiled through the snow , up , up , winding his way between the trunks of the hostile trees . often stumbling -- hitting his weary feet against broken twigs -- straining with a feeling that his veins would burst . so great was his exertion , but he would not give way ! he would not lay down his precious burden before he could find some cover for the night ! to rest there upon that bed of snow would be certain death .
such feasting as the townspeople had , such music and dancing ! when the wedding festivities were ended , the shepherd told the tsar who he really was . `` you say you are a prince ! '' the tsar cried , perfectly delighted at this news , then he declared he was not in the least surprised . in fact , he said , he had suspected as much from the first !
all this while the lady [female] watched the fortunes of the fight from the city wall . with her two sons standing on either hand . and when she saw the issue she hastened to greet him . the people of the city also , who had waited to see to whom the victory should fall . hastened to do him homage , right glad were they to be rid of the giant 's tyranny .
meanwhile they had entered the chief street of the town . which led to the drury lane theatre . this was a handsome building of white marble , with columns and a sculptured frieze . it was the model which the greeks long afterwards followed when they built their parthenon . a great multitude of people were collected in front of the pit and gallery entrances .
the [male] man prepares another drink which is filthy . and , even they themselves say , vile smelling . it is called `` sa fu eng ' , '' is drunk at meals , and is prepared as follows . cold water is first put in a jar , and into it are thrown cooked rice . cooked camotes , cooked locusts , and all sorts of cooked flesh and bones .
when [male] awoke he rubbed his eyes again . and laughed , and spoke aloud his thanks to the fairies and the master woodsman who had sent them . with eager joy he examined all his new possessions . wondering what some might be used for , but , in the days when he had clung to the girdle of the great ak and visited the cities of men . his eyes had been quick to note all the manners and customs of the race to which he belonged .
if one appeared before him , he would put himself in a terrible rage . in consequence of this dislike , the sexton had gone to visit the farmer 's wife during her husband 's absence from home . and the good woman had placed before him the best she had in the house to eat . when she heard the farmer coming she was frightened . and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room .
but the [male] was as strong as he , and as soon as the bull killed one of his heads . the others breathed fresh life into it . and it took a full week before the bull got the better of him . but then he was so wretched and so weak that he could not move a bit . his whole body was covered with wounds ; and he could not even tell the king 's daughter to take the horn of ointment from the [male] 's girdle and anoint him with the salve .
now we can have milk and cheese and butter ! ', cried she , ah ! how good milk is , what a pity it is so ruinously expensive ! so they made a little shelter of branches for the beautiful creature which was quite [female] . and followed [female] about like a dog when she took it out every day to graze . one morning as she sat by a little brook .
drak disappeared without answering ; and [female] , after taking leave of tambourinet . mounted his horse again , he had not gone a hundred paces . when the saddle turned and threw him roughly to the ground . he arose a little stunned , rebuckled the straps , and mounted his horse again . a little farther on , as he was going over a bridge .
my brother , who expected no such civility , thanked the porter . and with his permission entered the palace , which was so large , that it took him a considerable time to reach the bermecide 's apartment . at last he came to a fine square building . of excellent architecture , and entered by a porch , through which he saw one of the finest gardens . with gravel walks of several colours , extremely pleasant to the eye .
now and then a wave rolled over them , the current lifted them . the water , although deep , was so clear that for a moment he imagined he saw the shoals of mackerel glittering . or leviathan himself ready to swallow them , now the clouds cast a shadow over the water . then again came the playing sunbeams ; flocks of loudly screaming birds passed over him . and the plump and lazy wild ducks which allow themselves to be drifted by the waves rose up terrified at the sight of the swimmer .
by this time , out on the floating farm . the mother and children were wild with fear of starving . all the food for the cattle had been eaten up , the dog had no meat . the cat no milk , and the [person] had run out of its supply of frogs . there was no sugar or coffee , and neither rye nor currant bread .
this kind of reasoning is only too common , when the object is to show that [location] was the birthplace of any widely diffused popular fiction . in [location] , people argue , this or that tale has a moral . among celts and kamschatkans it has no moral . but certain stories did undeniably come from [location] in literary works . like the stories of sindibad , therefore this or that story also came from [location] .
the first thing the boy did when he landed was to tear off his cap and wave it . so that the big white gander should see where he was , here am i . where are you ? here am i , where are you ? he called . and was rather surprised that [male] was not already at his side , but the big white gander was not to be seen . nor was the wild goose flock outlined against the sky , it had entirely disappeared .
ashenputtel went to the grave three times every day . wept and prayed , and every time a little white bird came and perched upon the tree . and when she uttered a wish , the little bird threw down to her what she had wished for . now it happened that the king proclaimed a festival . which was to last three days , and to which all the beautiful maidens in the country were invited .
the mother bear pushed the boy along to the cubs . one of them nabbed him quickly and ran off with him . but he did not bite hard , he was playful and wanted to amuse himself awhile with [male] before eating him . the other cub was after the first one to snatch the boy for himself . and as he lumbered along he managed to tumble straight down on the head of the one that carried the boy .
the old toad was down under the marsh , decorating her room with rushes and yellow [female] leaves . to make it very grand for her new daughter in law . then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf where [female] lay . she wanted to fetch the pretty cradle to put it into her room before [female] herself came there . the old toad bowed low in the water before her , and said : here is my son .
after a tough walk , during which [male] said little or nothing . we got to the shieling , where two girls . a cousin of [male] and his sister . met [location] with bright hearty faces , they had been up there looking after the cattle since june . and it was now august , and they had made heaps of butter and cheese .
[male] 's fingers grew [male] . and yet he often wondered to see how true to life his puppets were . how they sighed , how they embraced and clung . as if their hearts were coming in two when the parting drew near , how lingeringly the little queen drew up the sheet over her face . when her lover did not return , and let it fall to cover her with a quiet sigh .
[male] peeped through the curtains , it would be terrible if [male] were now in the mill . but [male] was not in the mill ; no , what was much worse , he was just below it . there was high talk , angry words ; there would be fighting , perhaps murder . [female] opened her window in alarm . called [male] 's name , and told him to go away .
suddenly , in the twilight , they saw her eyes shining blue like the sky on a clear day . and her lips flushed and opened , and she smiled , and there were her little white teeth . and look , she had black hair . and it stirred in the wind , she began dancing in the snow . like a little white spirit , tossing her long hair , and laughing softly to herself .
the poor little orphan girl 's and her father 's wedding were celebrated together . there was plenty to eat and drink , so that even the orphan children had rice to eat . behind the door there stood a sack in which the danube and the theiss were kept . i too was among the dancing guests , and had a long spur made of straw on my boot . somebody pushed me by accident .
this advice seemed good to [male] , and so encouraged was he by the hope of ridding himself of his secret that he straightway began to mend . in a short time he had recovered strength enough to start forth and carry out the suggestion of his mother . he traveled many miles from home and came at length to a desert place full of rocks and sand . far from every sign of human dwelling , and in the middle of this waste land he found a deep , dark hole . kneeling upon the ground , [male] put his lips close to this hole and whispered all his secret .
at peep of day off he set again . for he could take no rest , so he rode and walked and walked and rode the whole day through the wide wood . where there were so many green spots and glades that shone so bright and lovely between the trees . he did not know at all where he was or whither he was going . but he gave himself no more time to rest than when his horse cropped a bit of grass .
uncle [male] let her talk . he had his own idea , they sat down at the table . after eating its supper the big cat , never too warm , settled itself on a chair by the side of the stove . and soon , with its back turned to the warm sheet iron , began to [male] with happiness . all was going as desired ; [male] projects were taking an excellent turn .
i am a poor lad , and live in one of the narrowest of lanes . but i do not want for light , as my room is high up in the house . with an extensive prospect over the neighbouring roofs , during the first few days i went to live in the town . i felt low spirited and solitary enough , instead of the forest and the [location] of former days . i had here only a forest of chimney pots to look out upon .
once there was a gardener who lived in an old hut of a house . with one table inside , and some rough stools . and a large box that served for a bed , all of which he had made himself . there was one window ; but when it stormed the rain beat in so that the old lady . his wife , had to pin her shawl against it .
patty rode cheerfully on her way , looking as happy and handsome as the best farmer 's daughter of them all . so everybody in the market said -- and she soon sold all her butter at the very best prices of the day . and so [female] went on thriving , and doing good to every one in need . until in course of time , she grew into a beautiful and lovable young woman . living in comfort with her old parents in one of the prettiest cottages in the village .
this he did in not many days time , [male] travelling with him as before . after a while they saw a damsel on a palfrey . flying as fast as she could , and two knights pursuing her also at their utmost speed . they saw also how another knight was riding after these two , each was intent on his own business . the two knights on chasing the damsel , the single knight on chasing the two .
poor lady [male] could not but be hurt by the prince 's preference for death over marriage to her . little as she liked him , is life . then , so worthless ? and is [male] so terrible a person that you prefer those arms , and she pointed to the gibbet , `` to these ? '' -- here she held out her own . which were very white , round and pretty : for [female] was a good hearted girl .
her sisters began to laugh and mock at her , but the prime minister . who had come to make trial of the slipper , looked at [female] attentively . and seeing how good-looking she was , said that it was but just -- he had orders to try it upon every one . the prime minister was kept very busy during the next few weeks , he asked [female] to sit down . and drawing the slipper upon her little foot , he saw that it went on easily .
leo tried to go to sleep ; but after doing everything he could think of . such as imagining a flock of sheep jumping a fence , and counting a hundred backward and forward . he gave it up as useless . all the strange things he had seen would come back , and his eyelids were like little spring doors that bobbed open in spite of his attempts to close them . as they lifted for the hundredth time he saw [male] doubled up in a heap .
so the man with the [male] thanked the other for his good advice and rapped at the door . when he got in , everything happened just as the old man had said it would . all the people , great and small , came round him like ants on an ant hill . and each tried to outbid the other for the [male] , at first they would not hear to this . and haggled and bargained with the man , but he stuck to what he had said .
said , hearing this brutal suggestion , made a desperate effort for his life . spurring his horse , he rode off at full speed . but the bandits soon recovered from their amazement , and , giving chase . had him at their [male] , tears , prayers . even bribes were of no avail , and the wretched said was left to face death in its most painful form .
they sailed again the next day , and found themselves entangled in contrary currents and perplexing winds . so that they were long in reaching another island , green and fertile , watered by rivers which were full of fish . and covered with vast herds of sheep as large as heifers . here they renewed their stock of provisions . and chose a spotless lamb with which to celebrate easter sunday on another island .
i wanted , besides , a sextant . a few philosophical instruments , and some books , to purchase these things . i made several unwilling journeys to [location] and [location] . choosing a time when i could be hid by the favouring clouds . as all my ill gotten gold was exhausted , i carried over from [location] some ivory .
it was now quite dark , and the horizon was hidden , here and there the darkness was pierced by the luminous points of some windows in the village which were still lit up . suddenly there appeared in the street the red moving flame of torch and in the circle of light formed by it a red face wearing a pair of moustaches . at moments there also came to view in the same luminous circle a horse 's head with its ears erect , `` panteleieff ! '' cried the colonel in the direction of the torch . the torch entered into the courtyard , and soon the horse stood before the officers .
the captain now assumed the character of a merchant . and conveyed gradually a great many sorts of rich stuffs and fine linen to his lodging from the cavern . but with all the necessary precautions imaginable to conceal the place whence he brought them . in order to dispose of the merchandise , when he had amassed them together . he took a warehouse , which happened to be opposite to [male] 's .
[female] would have caught her in his arms . but no , she wouldn t let him , then you would have been delighted to see dot run into the carrier 's arms . you may be sure the carrier was in a state of perfect rapture . and you may be sure that everybody , especially miss slowboy . wept for joy , and she .
the minister 's son embarked in this old vessel . and thanks to favorable winds , at length reached his own country . in spite of the pitiable condition in which he returned they received him joyfully . `` i am the first to come back , '' said he to the king . now fulfil your promise , and give me the princess in marriage .
the third sister 's turn followed ; she was the boldest of them all . and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into the sea . on the banks she saw [location] covered with beautiful vines . palaces and castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest . she heard the birds singing .
for the sake of the hoard [male] had slain [male] . his father , and [male] had plotted death against [male] , his brother . not all this history did [male] know , but a shadow of its evil touched his spirit as he stood there before the gleaming and glittering heap . he would take all of it away , but not now , the tale that the birds told was in his mind . and the green of the forest was more to him than the glitter of the treasure heap .
in fright the cat scampered up the tree and the bear . of course , supposed that the awful creature now was after him . in his frantic efforts to escape he tumbled down out of the tree and broke two ribs . but for all that he made off , too terrified to look back , so the fox and the cat were left to finish the ox in peace . having sacrificed his ox in order to feast the fox 's servant .
ere the butler could raise the [female] again , or the cook recover the spit . with a roar to terrify the dead , [female] dashed into the room . her eyes flaming like candles , she went straight at the butler . he was down in a moment , and she on the top of him . wagging her tail over him like a lioness .
fair as the dawn was [female] . and about her a freshness like that of babes . there was in her hair the ruddiness of tried gold . spun into a web to catch the sun . like the sky in the east at twilight were her eyes .
the king , queen , and nobles . all tried to catch the butterfly , but could not , at last poor [male] . having no saddle or bridle , slipped off and tumbled into a watering pot . where he was nearly drowned before he could be taken out , but he soon recovered from this mishap . and once more became the pride and ornament of king [male] 's court .
`` it is all right , '' says the king . `` we will surely keep you , '' and [male] was employed . and sent out into the garden to work there , now at this time the king of the east declared war on the king of scotland . the king of the east had a mighty army entirely . and he threatened to wipe the king of scotland off the face of the earth .
[female] me ! she cried , and jumped back to the other side of the road . if it is fit brim full o gold pieces , ! for a while she could do nothing but walk round and round her treasure . admiring the yellow gold and wondering at her good luck .
the little emperor didn t know whether it would or not . however , he couldn t be more bored than he was already . so he climbed down from his throne and went out into the windy autumn garden . first marched the musicians , beating on drums to let every one know that the emperor was coming . then came the court ladies tottering along on their `` golden lilies , '' which is what they call their tiny feet that have been bound up tightly to keep them small ever since the ladies were babies .
his whole married life , with its fierce , fiery coloured joys and the terrible agony of its sudden ending . seemed to come back to him today as he watched the infanta playing on the terrace . she had all the queen 's pretty petulance of manner . the same wilful way of tossing her head , the same proud curved beautiful mouth . the same wonderful smile—vrai sourire de [female] indeed—as she glanced up now and then at the window .
there was once upon a time a king who had a son who was very fond of hunting . he often allowed him to indulge in this pastime . but he had ordered his grand vizir always to go with him , and never to lose sight of him . one day the huntsman roused a stag . and the prince , thinking that the vizir was behind , gave chase .
but hour after hour went by , and neither [male] nor the boy [male] returned . the night approached , parties of searchers anxiously beat the woods and patrolled the cliffs . for long they found nothing , but at last a boat 's crew . landing perilously at the foot of the precipices , came upon the body of the excise officer . a sword cut in his head , lying half in and half out of the water .
the red champion sprang out on the shingles , he made his proclamation . then up to him came [male] the hen wife 's son . `` i will strive with you , '' said he . as i strove with you yesterday and the day before . and how shall we fight ? shall it be with swords or by wrestling ?
`` no , it would not , [female] , '' said a clear , metallic voice . close at his ear , `` bless me , what 's that ? '' exclaimed [male] , jumping up . there was nobody there , he looked round the room . and under the table , and a great many times behind him . but there was certainly nobody there , and he sat down again at the window .
so , casting another look at his steed , who was contentedly browsing , the prince climbed up the mountainside in the direction of the sound . the prince climbed and climbed , he went in this direction and in that . yet the sound never grew any louder or fainter . suddenly he realized that he was hopelessly lost , the little path up which he had ridden had vanished completely . and he had not the slightest idea in which direction it lay .
the fierce storm swept away many a familiar landmark of the road . and buffeted the samurai so that he became weary almost to fainting . noontide was as dark as twilight , twilight was as dark as night . and when night fell it was as black as the night of yomi . where lost souls wander and cry , by this time [male] had lost his way in a wild .
then the young man understood how true his brother had been to him . and he sat down and wept and wrung his hands because of the wicked murder that he had done . suddenly he sprang to his feet , for he remembered the ointment which lay hidden in his garments . and he rushed to the place where his brother still lay . he fell on his knees beside the body .
`` seize him , '' shouted sir [male] in a rage . `` he had ruled out my daughter , '' consistency had never been one of the baron 's strong points . the vassals closed up behind young [male] , who was pinioned in a second , he struggled with them till the veins stood out in his forehead in blue knots . but , after all , one young man of twenty is not much among a band of stout yeomen . and they all fell in a heap on the floor .
in the shetland isles mermaids are said to dwell among the fishes . in the depths of the ocean , in mansions of [person] and [person] . they resemble human beings , but greatly excel them in beauty . when they wish to visit the earth they put on the [person] or garb of some fish . but if they lose this garment , all hopes of return are annihilated and they must stay where they are .
before dawn the palace was roused by the news that the king was dead . and that the three officers of the guards were dying also , of course nobody 's cries and laments were as loud as those of the queen . but when once the splendid funeral was over , she gave out that she was going to shut herself up in a distant castle till the year of her mourning was over . and after appointing a regent of the kingdom , she set out attended only by a maid who knew all her secrets . once she had left the palace she quickly began to work her spells .
now , when [female] and the little white sailor duck woke up in the land of nod . they both rubbed their eyes to make sure who stood there dressed in pink pajamas and little starry crown . it was the little dream god . in his hand he carried a silver wand . in the handle of which was a little whistle which made a soft sound when he blew upon it .
bova rode for two months . until he came to a desert , where there was neither river . brook , nor fountain , and grew sore athirst , at length he met a pilgrim . who had a leather bottle full of water . and he begged him for a draught to quench his thirst .
he called [male] , the deacon . and gave him authority over the other twenty three disciples during his absence . and then , clad only in a long cassock , he bent his steps towards the nile . intending to follow the libyan bank to the city founded by the macedonian monarch . he walked from dawn to [male] .
at last , not knowing what else to do , she resolved to consult a certain witch who was called `` the fairy of the desert . '' now this was very difficult to do , as she was guarded by some terrible lions . but happily the queen had heard a long time before that whoever wanted to pass these lions safely must throw to them a cake made of [female] flour . sugar candy , and crocodile 's eggs , this cake she prepared with her own hands . and putting it in a little basket , she set out to seek the fairy .
all his hair and his armour shone with a red and blue flame . and the light of him struck the vaulting and the floor like the rays of a torch as it burns . over his head a dark tunnel , bored in the solid rock . reached up a hollow throat seawards . but not by that way came the wind and the sound of the sea .
`` god grant it ! '' said the mother , but she did not believe it would be so . she took a little stick and propped up the green plant which had given her daughter such pleasure . so that it might not be broken by the winds , she tied the piece of string to the window sill and to the upper part of the frame . so that the pea tendrils might have something to twine round .
after five months of play , [female] wakes up one fine morning and finds a great surprise awaiting him . finally the wagon arrived , it made no noise . for its wheels were bound with straw and rags , it was drawn by twelve pair of donkeys . all of the same size , but all of different color , some were gray . others white , and still others a mixture of brown and black .
so they were married , and the bride was very jealous of her husband 's beauty and led him a dog 's life . so he managed to get into debt and made her miserable in turn . as for the glass dog , the wizard set him barking again by means of his wizardness and put him outside his door . i suppose he is there yet , and am rather sorry , for i should like to consult the wizard about the moral to this story . a king once died , as kings are apt to do , being as liable to shortness of breath as other mortals .
milan sighed deeply when he heard what the little dove said . then he jumped up suddenly from the table and ran to the door . where he found the beautiful [male] waiting for him . outside stood his faithful charger , pawing the ground , without pausing for a moment . [male] and [male] mounted him and galloped as fast as they could into the country of king [male] .
the lake was so clear that had not the wind rustled the branches of the trees and the bushes so that they moved . they would have seemed painted in the depths of the lake . for every leaf , whether in the shade or in the [female] . was reflected in the water , when [female] saw her own face she was quite terrified at finding it so brown and ugly . but after she had wet her little hand and rubbed her eyes and forehead .
she wondered if she could have been dreaming , but no that could not be . there were her footprints leading up the bank and down again , where she had gone for the lint . and brought it back , and there was the mark of her foot . wet with dew , on a stone in the middle of the stream . where she had stood when she had handed the lint up to the mysterious little stranger .
the news of this offer was noised about in all parts of the world . a great many kings and princes hastened to make the trial . taking their turn and keeping watch , but each one lost his life in the attempt . for they could not prevent , indeed they were not even able to see , the princess take her flight . now it happened that [male] , prince of a royal city .
in a report of 1854 the `` morungs '' are described as large buildings generally situated at the principal entrances and varying in number according to the size of the village . they are in fact the main guardhouse . and here all the young unmarried men sleep , in front of the morung is a raised platform as a lookout . commanding an extensive view of all approaches , where a naga is always kept on duty as a sentry . ... in the morungs are kept skulls carried off in battle .
the scenes did not follow the natural sequence of life . the saddest and most joyful together , but the last had the deepest shadows , the beech forests of denmark are admitted by all to be fine . but [male] still to the eyes of old [male] were those around the wartburg . more majestic and lofty the aged trees around the baronial castle , where the foliage of creepers trailed over the stone buttresses . sweeter there the perfume of apple blossoms .
beyond the wood , over the lonely moors , rode a lady . so fair a lady had [female] never seen , her palfrey was dapple grey and she herself shone as the summer sun . her saddle was of pure ivory , bright with many precious stones and hung with cloth of richest [female] . the girths of her saddle were of silk and the buckles were each one a [female] . her stirrups of clear crystal and adorned with pearls hung ready for her fairy feet .
thus , while the busy [female] bustled about the house , or plied her spinning wheel at one end of the piazza . honest [male] would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other . watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior , who , armed with a sword in each hand . was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle of the barn . in the meantime , [male] would carry on his suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm .
and i have seen the fairy contentment start from her nest among the lilies . and follow the little one as she ran off to play , do you want to know how contentment looks ? some people think she is the most beautiful among all the fairies . ( and there are hosts of them , and some of the bad ones . even , have handsome faces , ) her cheeks are not quite as rosy as love 's .
said the people : they did not know what they were . then the merchant had the cat that he had bought for the scullion brought . and when the cat went over the table , the mice had to hurry into their holes . and not in the memory of man had the people been able to eat in such comfort . then they begged and implored the merchant to sell them his cat .
and young blood began its course anew . booted and spurred , into the saddle again , face toward the west ! and off for round the world away , a little higher and stronger piped the compelling melody . why , here are the mountains , god bless them ! nay , brother , god has blessed them .
upon the cruel soldiers heads their helmets dissolved . their heavy armour melted ; spears and axes grew red hot . heat overcame the wrathful princess ; heat overcame the multitude of archers as their brains grilled inside their helmets . and their breasts laboured with the heat under their armour . who had not the shelter of a roof could not live , all the host was struck down by the heat .
it chanced on the very night when [person] and [person] had given a skinful of sore bones to the german impostor [person] . that the countess of [person] , mother of the [person] . was brought to be buried at midnight among the ruins ofruth , such had been the custom of the family from ancient times . indeed , ever since the great [person] fell fighting at the red harlaw against [person] of the isles . more recently there had been another reason for such a strange fashion of burial , for the family were catholics .
the good saint had indeed come , and the sweet chimes of the christ bell had been heard . and the fair [female] was now the queen of king [male] . soon were tidings brought to [female] of the swan maiden and her three swan brothers . strange tales did she hear of their haunting songs . it was told her , too , of their cruel miseries .
he left for [male] , after bidding the merchant an affectionate farewell . and in the holy city he applied himself diligently to his studies . he delighted his teachers with his cheerful attention to his lessons . and discovered a new source of happiness in learning things for himself from observation . also , it was a pleasant sensation to conduct his own affairs .
his father , therefore , implored him to make him a full confession of his love . and , whoever the person whom he wished might be , he should have her . the prince produced the shoe , and declared that he wanted the young lady to whom the shoe belonged . so it was announced throughout the whole realm , that all the ladies of the country should appear next sunday to try on the shoe . and whosoever 's foot it fitted she should become the prince 's wife .
scarcely was mr. [male] seated , ere a pair of little hands were busy with each foot . removing gaiter and shoe , and supplying their place with a soft slipper . there was not one in the household who did not feel happier for his return . nor one who did not seek to render him some kind office . `` i see light ahead , '' were the hopeful words of mr. [male] .
now , in a case like this i always trap them two or three nights and catch a few . just to give satisfaction to those engaging me , sometimes gentlemen will write inviting me to meet them at a certain farm . and bring my ferrets and a good supply of nets . alleging that there are `` hundreds of rats in the stacks . '' i just relate this to indicate how anyone not regularly amongst rats can easily be deceived as to their numbers .
but protected by his tough black skin and steely scales as by a coat of mail . he remained unhurt , [male] now tried his lance . and with more success , for it pierced the side of the beast . who , furious with pain , sprang at his adversary . when [male] , leaping aside , succeeded in fixing the point of his spear within his jaws .
the prince 's grief at the death of his mother was great . but it was nothing compared to that of the king . his father , who was quite inconsolable for the loss of his dear wife . neither time nor reason seemed to lighten his sorrow . and the sight of all the familiar faces and things about him only served to remind him of his loss .
after much seeking the fakir found the penny and started on his errand . whilst the princess went off shopping , first she bought a farthing 's worth of oil . and then she bought three farthings worth of flax . when she got back with her purchases she set the old man on the bedstead and rubbed his crippled leg with the oil for an hour . then she sat down to the spinning wheel and spun and spun all night long whilst the old man slept .
so they went into it , and the cat told [male] to say this was his house . as for the castle inside , it was far finer than it looked outside . for everything was pure gold -- chairs , and tables . and benches , and all , and when the king had gone all over it . and seen everything high and low , he got quite shameful and downcast .
the young knights obeyed the king 's command willingly . and practised daily at the tourney , seats were raised on the stand before worms for the guests that were coming into burgundy . when it was time for them to arrive . fair [male] heard the news , that they were about to hold a hightide with their friends . then the beautiful women busied them with their kirtles and their headgear that they were to wear .
what [female] , if it would only stay , a tiny , soft thing to fondle and kiss . to sing to him all day long , and be his playfellow and companion . tame and tender , while to the rest of the world it was a wild bird of the air . what a pride , what a delight , to have something that nobody else had . something all his own , as the traveling cloak traveled on , he little heeded where .
so he wrote a letter , saying that the son of the king of erin and the queen of the lonesome island had spent six days and nights in the golden chamber of tubber tintye . had taken away three bottles of water from the flaming well . and had eaten from the table of gold , putting this letter under the pillow of the queen . he went out , stood in the open window . sprang on the back of the lean and shaggy little horse .
the fly alighted on the plate of a [male] who was eating rice . and the jogi took on his natural shape and told the [male] to scatter the rice which she was eating on the ground and she did so . but the boy turned himself into a bead of [female] on the necklace which the [female] was wearing . and the jogi did not notice this but became a pigeon and ate up the rice which the [male] had thrown down . when he did not find the boy among the rice he turned himself into a jogi again and saw him in the necklace .
when daylight began to appear , the bailiff was half dead ; and so glad was he to leave loose of the calf 's tail . that he forgot the sack of money and all else . he walked now slowly -- more slowly than the sheriff and the attorney had done . but , the slower he went , the more time had everyone to stare and look at him . and they used it too , and no one can imagine how tired out and ragged he looked after his dance with the calf .
the boy never forgot what his mother told him . and the tones of the old [organization] reverberated in his heart till he reached manhood . in such sweet remembrance was the old [organization] cherished by the boy . who grew up in poverty to be tall and slender , with a freckled complexion and hair almost red . but his eyes were clear and blue as the deep sea , and what was his career to be ?
a was an ant who seldom stood still , and who made a nice house in the side of a hill . a nice little ant , b was a book with a binding of blue . and pictures and stories for me and for you . b nice little book , c was a cat who ran after a rat . but his courage did fail when she seized on his tail .
one day as the ugly one was ironing in his shop in the basement of 263 1/2 main street . he looked up and saw a crowd of childish faces pressed against the window . most chinamen make friends with children . this one hated them and tried to drive them away , but as soon as he returned to his work they were back at the window again . mischievously smiling down upon him , the naughty mandarin uttered horrid words in the manchu language and made fierce gestures .
the men were ordered to take horses , and hunt in every road and path and by way . the baron himself had just drawn on his jack boots and girded on his sword . when he glanced out the window , and paused because of what he saw . a lady was approaching the castle on horseback . beside her , mounted on a black charger , was a cavalier .
so they set about making secretly a large cage of poles . having the sides latticed , so that [female] should receive both air and light . and this cage was to be placed on a bullock cart which happened to be going in the same direction . the rest of the company put on masks and disguised themselves in various manners . so that the knight might not know them again , these preparations being finished .
after having viewed me well , and perceiving me to be so lean that i had nothing but skin and bone . he let me go , he took up all the rest . one by one , and viewed them in the same manner ; and the captain being the fattest . he held him with one hand . as i might a sparrow , and thrusting a spit through him .
they could not help seeing the yellow mountain , for the setting sun reflected its glory upon it and made it shine like red and liquid gold . with that the old woman left the girl , with the shadow of evening falling on her . [female] did as she had been told , she journeyed to the yellow mountain . which shone in the moonlight like a pillar of burnished silver . and she arrived at its summit as the day dawned .
so [female] sucked in the corners of her mouth to keep from smiling . and tried hard to feel very cross indeed , but , as you will imagine . it was not easy to do in that place , as you have already guessed . the place into which [female] went when she shut the ivory doors was a sort of garden . but not an ordinary one , to be sure , it had the pool .
`` but what am i to do with my torn sleeve ? '' asked [female] . for she was still angry with that disagreeable old crab , without answering , the king of the crabs crawled off into the tall sea grass and in a few minutes came back with a little package done up in sea weed . and after he had unwrapped it , what do you suppose [male] saw ? why , a beautiful pale sea green coat made of sea silk . it was very beautiful and looked just like the shimmery green of the waves .
he had heard , too , from his grandfather , that many kings sons had already come , and had tried to get through the thorny hedge . but they had remained sticking fast in it , and had died a pitiful death . then the youth said , `` i am not afraid , i will go and see the beautiful [male] . '' the good old man might dissuade him as he would .
this peculiarity of the wound dealt to the wer wolf being reproduced in the human being is emphasised by an incident which occurred about 1588 in a tiny village situated in the mountains of auvergne . a gentleman was gazing one evening from the windows of his castle when he saw a hunter he knew passing on his way to the chase . calling to him , he begged that on his return he would report what luck he had had . the hunter after pursuing his way was attacked by a large [male] . he fired off his gun without hitting the animal .
sir [male] looked about him as he rode behind . to see if there was any armourer or knightly person whom he knew . but there was none , when he saw the knight and the lady and the dwarf enter the castle . and was sure that they would sojourn there , he rode about the little town . and found it full of knights and squires .
and the princes were so sure that [female] was far prettier than her portrait that they went without a [female] . they were very kindly treated , and that they might not feel dull the king came often to see them . as for [male] 's portrait that was taken up to the palace . and the king did nothing but gaze at it all day and all night . as the king and the prince had to stay in prison .
the king of persia was extremely surprised to see a slave of so beauteous a form so ignorant of the world . he attributed this to the narrowness of her education . and the little care that had been taken to instruct her in the first rules of civility . he went to her at the window , where , notwithstanding the coldness and indifference with which she had received him . she suffered herself to be admired , caressed , and embraced , as much as he pleased .
and at sunrise [female] went and bathed , and anointed himself from head to foot . and his shield , and his helmet , and his weapons . and bade his comrades try the spell , so they tried to bend his lance . but it stood like an iron bar . and [male] in spite hewed at it with his sword .
now [female] had been absent in the spirit upon that day . when he returned he found his temple destroyed . and the spirit of the hill gave him the details . [male] hurried to his master and related with tears what had befallen him . the latter was roused and said : it is li dsing 's fault .
when they had eaten as much as they liked , they got up . and pursued their walk through gardens separated from one another only by small ditches . which marked out the limits without interrupting the communication ; so great was the confidence the inhabitants reposed in each other . by this means the african magician drew [male] insensibly beyond the gardens . and crossed the country , till they nearly reached the mountains .
the queen had so many presents , and very fine they were . too , that the christmas tree could not hold them all . so they were put on a table before the throne and wreathed around with holly and with pine . the little prince went in with his nurse to see them . and to put his gift , which was a jewel , among them .
these ravens had once been sea maidens , but they had desired men for husbands . and they had gone to them , the men forsook them . and they had become first witches and afterwards ravens . ever since their change they wished harm to the maidens of the sea . i had been frightened of them , but now i had seen them flapping about so often that i was no longer or i was only a little , afraid .
obeying this command , the legs took the head and started off . and perhaps you can imagine how funny the prince 's head looked perched on his legs . with neither body nor arms , after a careful search they found the body lying upon the ground at the foot of a shrimp salad tree . but nothing more could be done without the arms ; so they next searched for those . and , having discovered them , the legs kicked them to where the body lay .
the following are done later , perhaps not till after the sending out of the formal invitation . but they may conveniently be dealt with here , the people erect near to , but outside . the village in which the feast is to be held one or more sheds for the accommodation of the guests . the number of sheds depending upon the requirements of the case . these are merely gable and ridge shaped roofs , which descend on each side down to the ground .
the minor canon , relieved from his fears , lay back , and dropped into a doze . and when he was sound asleep the [male] took him up . and carried him back to the town , he arrived just before daybreak . and putting the young man gently on the grass in the little field where he himself used to rest . the monster , without having been seen by any of the people , flew back to his home .
there was the story of [female] martling . a large blue bearded dutchman , who had nearly taken a british frigate with an old iron nine pounder from a mud breast work . only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge . and there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless , being too rich a mynheer to be lightly mentioned . who , in the battle of white plains , being an excellent master of defence .
the sister tried , by other arguments , to reconcile her to the life which had been preserved . but the words her devout heart inspired and which were intended for a pious soul . produced little influence upon the neglected child of the highroad . [male] felt most deeply the reference to the sorely afflicted mother of god . if such sorrow had been sent to the noblest and purest of mortals , through whom god had deigned to give his divine son to the world .
he accordingly gave the gifts to his sisters . who took them and kept them carefully , and never showed them to any but most particular friends . after their death they reverted to their brother . who took them to himself , and with him they remained so long as he lived . he showed them to the minister [male] .
in the night , [female] lay by [female] 's bed . and in the daytime sat beside him when he was studying his lessons . the puppy was not allowed to go along to school , but he met [male] every afternoon . and barked with joy and wagged his tail , one winter morning [male] the grenadier and some of the farm hands were going to the woods to haul timber with seven horses . [male] had a holiday that day .
but round the castle a hedge of [male] roses began to grow up . every year it grew higher , till at last it surrounded the whole castle so that nothing could be seen of it . not even the flags on the roof , but round the castle a hedge of [male] roses began to grow up . after many , many years a prince came again to the country and heard an old man tell of the castle which stood behind the [male] hedge . in which a most beautiful [female] called [female] rose had been asleep for the last hundred years .
they took the island of ebene in their way to the isles of the children of [male] . they went to the capital of the island . where reigned a king whose name was [male] . the persons who first landed giving out that they brought prince [male] . who was returning from a long voyage towards his own country , and was forced to put in there by a storm .
one day there was a great crowd round the travelling booth where he was on view . the showman had a new wonder which he was about to show to the people . he took the little jackdaw out of his cage . and set him to perch upon his shoulder , while he busied himself over something which he was taking carefully out of ever so many boxes and coverings . and now the showman began holding up a small glass bottle for the crowd to stare into .
but [female] was most astonished to see how he fired himself off , snap ! like the leap frogs which you make out of a goose 's breast bone . certainly he took the most wonderful shots , and backwards , too . for , if he wanted to go into a narrow crack ten yards off . what do you think he did ? if he had gone in head foremost .
the people believed that they had arranged things very comfortably for the lady squirrel . and they were astonished because she did not seem to be contented ; but , instead , she sat there . downcast and moody , in a corner of her room . every now and again , she would let out a shrill , agonised cry . she did not touch the food ; and not once did she swing round on the wheel .
some fishermen , coming with a boat , seized them and dragged them into it . the blood streamed down over [male] 's face . he seemed dead , but still held the young girl so tightly that they were obliged to take her from him by force . she was pale and lifeless ; they laid her in the boat . and rowed as quickly as possible to the shore , they tried every means to restore [male] to life .
the doctors were naturally very astonished and demurred at this new method of treatment . but he persisted in his determination , and the cigar never left his mouth till the painful business was successfully over ! the [male] baron was a mysterious person . why he lived for months together in that lonely spot . no one knew , true , he was fond of hunting .
[female] thanked the black man and gave him a piece of silver . and went away with the eggs tied up in his handkerchief , it was a good thing he had them . he had not gone more than halfway home , and was just coming out from a wood . when he heard a big noise , and the bull burst out of a thicket and came charging down on him . but quick as a flash [male] put the eggs in his mouth and climbed up a tree .
after [female] had finished his compliment in verse . which surprised prince [male] so agreeably , his highness took the liberty to make a sign to the king his father to quit the place where he was . and let [male] sit by him , the king . overjoyed at this alteration , which gave him hopes of his son 's speedy recovery . quitted his place ; and taking [male] by the hand .
three days and nights the tsar and his people had to drive . before they came to a place where the snow was light enough so they could shovel it and really reach the solid brown earth underneath . that was in the great forests , where owls hooted , wolves howled , and foxes barked all night . and big bears sat up on their haunches to watch the newcomers with doubt and curiosity . the people took saws and axes .
meanwhile the treacherous sir [male] had recovered , and in due course had become sheriff . and indicted his brother for felony , as [male] did not appear to answer the indictment he was proclaimed an outlaw and wolf's head . and a price was set upon his life , now his bondmen and vassals were grieved at this . for they feared the cruelty of the wicked sheriff . they therefore sent messengers to [male] to tell him the ill news .
yes , the lad cast out the carcasses , and then all the wild beasts in the wood . bears and wolves and lions . came after them , but when they saw the carcasses . they began to fight for them amongst themselves . till blood flowed in streams ; but [male] and the lad they quite forgot .
thus it sounds complainingly out of the bell deep in the odense au . that is what grandmother told us , but the schoolmaster says that there was not any bell that rung down there . for that it could not do so ; and that no au mann dwelt yonder . for there was no au mann at all , and when all the other church bells are sounding sweetly . he says that it is not really the bells that are sounding .
with an air of respect , mingled with astonishment . the widow asked who she was ? and how she came there ? the stranger explained how she had been menaced with great danger in her own country . and had fled with her child for concealment to this secluded spot . and should have perished from absolute want if it had not been for the good natured goat .
when [male] heard this , he sent for that wise man who in the house of [male] the harper had foretold the sorrow that would come upon his realm . and the wise man believed the words of [male] . and he caused a hedge of spears to encircle the burning house . and as the flames rose higher the sons of usna came forth with [female] the star eyed . and around her they placed their shields , and they cleft a way through the hedge of spears and came safely to the plain beyond .
it was a curious thing about this house . that if you were in [person] , you could see into both cada and bra . but , if you were in cada , you could not see into [person] . and if you were in bra , you could not see into either [person] or cada . as a general thing , it is easier to see from darkness towards light than from light towards darkness .
when i saw i was in a man 's shape i said i would take the child back to his father and mother . as i knew the grief they were in after him . i got a ship , and took the child with me . and when i was journeying i came to land on an island . and i saw not a living soul on it .
they advanced hastily , and eagerly asked him the origin of all these marvels . [male] smiled at their surprise , and recounted to them what had occurred to him . more than one shepherd felt jealous , and more than one shepherdess reddened with mortification . there were few of the latter in those parts who had not had designs upon the heart of the handsome shepherd . and a goddess or a fairy appeared to them by far too dangerous a rival .
the next night the second son set out to watch the pear tree , but he fared no better than the first . about midnight came the music , and in a little while he was snoring till the stones rattled . when the morning came another pear was gone , and he had no more to tell about it than his brother . the third night it was the turn of the youngest son . and he was more clever than the others , for , when the evening came .
when he was old enough his [male] taught him history . and whenever any great king or lovely princess was referred to , the [female] always took care to mention that he or she had a long nose . all the royal apartments were filled with pictures and portraits having this peculiarity . so that at last prince wish began to regard the length of his nose as his greatest [male] . and would not have had it an inch less even to save his crown .
[female] , [female] , the piper 's son . stole a pig and away he run , the pig was eat . and [male] was beat , and [male] went roaring down the street . old king [male] was a merry old soul . and a merry old soul was he !
she proved to be an excellent little nurse , and the farmer was never as content and patient as when she was sitting by him . chatting cheerfully , as she was now able to do , since she was no longer frightened of being scolded . or reading aloud some of her favourite stories , for she was naturally far from stupid . every morning and evening the invalid was sure to ask her about the weather . and , as we know , she was always ready with a forecast .
first she tasted the porridge of the great big bear . and that was too hot for her , next she tasted the porridge of the middle sized bear . but that was too cold for her , and then she went to the porridge of the little wee bear . and tasted it , and that was neither too hot nor too cold , but just right . and she liked it so well that she ate it all up , every bit !

a second time he rose and came toward her . and she threw the second stone at him . and he again sank down ; a third time he came more fiercely than before . when , seizing a third stone , she threw it with all her force . no sooner did it touch him than the spell was broken .
then the princess dallied with him , giving ear to his tales of terror and triumph . but , when he had supped and fallen asleep , she stole out and told the prince all about it . and he , bidding his wife farewell . rode off in haste to tell his brothers in law . when they heard his news they called up their forces .
the first to dance in the boiling oil were the poor whitings . the crabs followed , then the sardines , then the soles . then the anchovies , and at last it was [male] 's turn . seeing himself so near death , and such a horrible death . he was so frightened , and trembled so violently , that he had neither voice nor breath left for further entreaties .
[female] had that kind of a viewpoint about everything , it seemed . when they went to the theatre , she could tell [female] . before the curtain went up , and between the acts -- such things about the actors and the playwright and the manager . as made the play trebly interesting , on the east side they visited some of the settlements and `` prowled '' around the teeming slums . and [female] knew such touching stories of the old world conditions from which these myriads of foreign folk had escaped .
there was once an excessively mighty king , [male] the great , who died , leaving no sons or daughters . or any relation on the face of the earth . to inherit his crown , so his throne , at the time of which i write , was vacant . this mighty king had been of a very peculiar disposition . unlike other potentates , he took no delight in going to war .
i know a way of stealing fragrance from the new mown hay and storing it in flasks of petals made . to scent the air when all the flowers fade and leave the woodland world to sad decay . i know a way of coaxing snowflakes in their flight to stay so still awhile . that , as they hang in air , i weave them into frosty lace . to wear about my head upon a sultry day .
he was thinking in this way to himself one day as he was at work on the wooded hills . when the sound of rushing water caught his ear . he had often worked in the same spot before , and could not remember that there was any torrent or waterfall near . so , feeling rather surprised , he followed the sound , which got louder and louder until at last he came upon a beautiful little cascade . the water looked so clear and cool that he stooped down where it was flowing away in a quiet stream .
dapplegrim told him what he was to do the second time . and he turned himself into a lump of earth . and stuck himself between the hoof and the shoe on [male] 's left fore foot . once more the king 's daughter went and sought everywhere , inside and outside , until at last she came into the stable . and wanted to go into the stall beside [male] .

they went eagerly to the battle , and gave many great strokes . sir [male] had all advantage on his side . for he had the real excalibur , [male] le [male] having so ordained that king [male] should have been slain that day . king [male] 's sword never bit like sir [male] 's . and almost every stroke sir [male] gave wounded sore .

one of them was very fond of playing on the flute and his playing attracted a bonga girl who came to him looking like a human girl . while he was tending buffaloes , after the intimacy had lasted some time she invited him to visit her parents . so he went with her and she presented him to her father and mother as her husband . but he was very frightened at what he saw ; for the seats in the house were great coiled up snakes and on one side a number of tigers and leopards were crouching . directly he could get a word alone with his wife he begged her to come away but she insisted on his staying to dinner .
he endeavoured thus to appease him , and desired him to examine the matter . and see whether they did indeed commit the crime of which they were accused . it was now a hard thing for [male] to be so much master of himself as not to butcher his own children . he ordered them to be put under arrest . and sent for an emir called [male] , whom he commanded to carry them out of the city .
frightened out of her senses the girl managed to shut the door and lock it . the first thing she did was to take off the flowers and hide them . and then she went out to the garden to gather a fresh bunch before her husband 's return . she hunted everywhere , but nowhere could she find flowers such as he had given her . while she was still searching she heard him riding up to the door and she was obliged to go out to meet him .

he prayed devoutly to the holy virgin to intercede for his soul . and grant his fevered body rest ; when , as he turned his head wearily . far out on the desert gleamed a light , hope rose in his bosom . and he drew his aching limbs onward , till nearer and nearer gleamed the blessed light from a cool oasis in the desert . soon his foot pressed the soft turf , and green trees waved above his head .

[female] alighted from his horse , and , putting on his invisible coat . approached and aimed a blow at the giant 's head . but missing his aim he only cut off his nose . on this the giant seized his club and laid about him most unmercifully . `` nay , '' said [male] , `` if this be the case i would better dispatch you ! ''
[female] was taken so by surprise with this that he was just on the very point of turning round when he recollected himself . so , afraid that the like might happen again , he made a grab at the [male] . and caught him up in his hand ; but in his hurry he overset the pitcher . and spilt all the beer , so that he could not get a taste of it to tell what sort it was . he then swore that he would kill him if he did not show him where his money was .

how wonderfully glorious it must be to sit with the student under the same tree ! but that might not be , he was obliged to be content with the view through the keyhole . and to be glad of that , there he stood on the cold landing place . with the autumn wind blowing down from the loft hole : it was cold , very cold . but the little [male] only felt that when the light in the room was extinguished .
tails , tumbling pots , pans and dishes . in the kitchen , or hiding hats , and throwing stones down the chimneys onto the fireplaces . they even ceased their fun of mocking children . who were calling the cows home , by hiding behind the rocks and shouting to them . instead of these tricks , they saved their breath to blow the fires into a blast .
i think more words are unnecessary , you can not doubt that [male] soon convinced [male] of his love . nor that [male] took the lesson to himself . and now saw that god had placed in the human heart a witness of the possibility of his love to man . yes , the clinging affection we feel for those we have been kind to . our own power of forgiving any thing to them .
at a little distance from them there was a spectacle most beautiful to behold . this was afforded by the masked lady and the task in which she was engaged . she stood near an immense open window , beside the most beautiful dove cote ever seen . it was silver and green , topping a pillar of gold . it had several compartments , all containing pure white doves .

so they started on their way , and after much wandering they reached a spot where a great rock rose straight up in the middle of the road . instantly the serpent uncoiled itself from his neck . and , as it touched the damp earth , it resumed the shape of the lovely damsel . pointing to the rock , she showed him an opening just big enough for a man to wriggle through . passing into it , they entered a long underground passage .
`` let [location] go down to the shore of the sea . '' and to the shore of the sea they went . and after they had reached the shore , and beheld the sea stretching before them . and the isle of dhiurradh in the midst of it . the soul of [male] sank .
we will pay a visit to switzerland , and wander through that country of mountains . whose steep and rocky sides are overgrown with forest trees . let [location] climb to the dazzling snow fields at their summits . and descend again to the green meadows beneath , through which rivers and [organization] along as if they could not quickly enough reach the sea and vanish . fiercely shines the sun over those deep valleys , as well as upon the heavy masses of snow which lie on the mountains .

[female] and [female] laca used to play chess together .
there are few spots in lancashire more likely to have been peopled by fairies than that portion of the highway which runs along the end of penwortham wood . at all times the locality is very beautiful , but it is especially so in summer . when the thin line of trees on the one side of the road and the rustling wood upon the other cast a welcome shade upon the traveller . who can rest against the old railings , and look down upon a rich expanse of meadow land and corn fields . bounded in the distance by dim , solemn looking hills .
he must remember to say the charm sooner next time . but it was so difficult to remember anything in this [male] place ! where was he now ? there seemed to be faces -- thousands of faces -- peeping at him from every side . from every hole , and from every corner , the mirrors grew dull and duller . and then bright and brighter , [male] saw himself wherever he looked .
`` do not be long , '' replied [female] , and she watched him go with [male] eyes . when she was left by herself the poor girl began to feel afraid . she was alone for the first time in her life . and in the middle of a thick forest , suddenly she heard a noise among the trees . fearing lest it should be a wolf , she hid herself in the hollow trunk of a willow tree which hung over the fountain .

but [female] had let go her hand and was running back to the palace . she wanted to be alone to think this out , what had happened ? that it was truly a magic ring . as the fairy had told her , she had no doubt . that her wish was a bad one , that she had been bad enough to earn it . she was equally certain , what then had happened ? there was only one answer to her question .
he told the lady sparrow that it was a great comfort and happiness to him to find her in such a beautiful home and to know that she wanted for nothing . it was his anxiety to know how she fared and what had really happened to her that had led him to seek her . now he knew that all was well he could return home with a light heart . if ever she wanted him for anything she had only to send for him and he would come at once . the lady sparrow begged him to stay and rest several days and enjoy the change .
last evening , i read my diary to [female] . so that she might tell me the mistakes i had made and how i can better prepare for my next journey . while i read , she laughed until the tears ran down her cheeks . i was sorry that she made so light of my efforts and that the dangers i had encountered seemed so laughable to her . but she endeavored to soothe me by saying that she was the one who had made the mistakes and had instructed me badly .
the higher castes do not believe in witchcraft , if a man is ill they give him medicines and if he dies in spite of the medicine they do nothing further . but all the lower castes believe in witchcraft and know that it is a reality . the santal women learnt the craft first from [male] burn by playing a trick on him when he meant to teach their husbands . and now they take quite little girls out by night and teach them so that the craft may not die out . we know of many cases to prove that witchcraft is a reality .

there was general rejoicing when the dog made his appearance . running from one to another to get acquainted , and then , as they had already been delayed quite a little . they made haste to continue on their journey . together they traveled along the road the greater part of the day without mishap and without any [female] worth recording . as was her custom , the masked lady did not make her appearance among them as long as they were quite light hearted .
his features preserved in death an expression of ecstatic happiness . even the soldiers who guarded the cross were struck with wonder . [male] , accompanied by some of the [male] brethren . claimed the body , and buried it with the remains of the other martyrs in the crypt ofjohn the baptist . and the church venerated the memory of saint [male] the nubian .
and then in her dream she understood that the pearls were in truth the tears of those she had made sorrowful . kept and guarded by [male] in his treasure house , but given to her by [female] to be her punishment . before many days had passed , the king [male] returned . and when he learned that his little daughter was dead , he summoned the queen to his presence . [female] went haughtily , for she dared not altogether disobey .
nevertheless , when saturday morning came , seeing that the maid had spun all her share of the flax . [female] was greatly afraid ; so away she went to the palace of the fairy and told her misfortune . then the fairy embraced her with great affection . and gave her a bag full of spun thread , to present to the king and show him what a notable and industrious housewife she was . [male] took the bag , and without saying one word of thanks .
the sound came nearer and nearer ; she heard the dogs barking . and fled with terror into the cave , she hastily bound together the nettles she had gathered into a bundle and sat upon them . immediately a great dog came bounding toward her out of the ravine . and then another and another ; they barked loudly , ran back , and then came again . in a very few minutes all the huntsmen stood before the cave .
the king now understood how the queen he had had for some time past had been so ill tempered . he at once had a sack drawn over her head and made her be stoned to death . and after that torn in pieces by untamed horses . the two young fellows also told now what they had heard and seen in the queen 's room . for before this they had been afraid to say anything about it .
when the two looked , they said , `` really , friends , it is he ! '' and all fled , then the young man leaped down and pursued them , two of them fell to the ground in terror . but he did not disturb them , going on in pursuit of his father . when the old man was overtaken , he fell to the ground . he was terrified , the young man sat astride of him .
some time after that [female] and [female] went to catch a dish of fish . as they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water . as if it were going to leap in , they ran to it and found it was the dwarf . `` where are you going ? '' said [male] ; `` you surely do not want to go into the water ? '' `` i am not such a fool , '' cried the dwarf ; `` do not you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in ? ''
these details will partly account for the lateness of my appearing . but there is yet another cause , professional ambition suggested that literary labours . unpopular with the vulgar and the half educated , are not likely to help a man up the [male] of promotion . but common sense presently suggested to me that , professionally speaking , i was not a success . and , at the same time , that i had no cause to be ashamed of my failure .
in this way , from different causes , the water of which the sun has robbed our rivers and seas . comes back to us , after it has travelled to various parts of the world . floating on the bosom of the air , but it does not always fall straight back into the rivers and seas again . a large part of it falls on the land . and has to trickle down slopes and into the earth , in order to get back to its natural home .
acting on this resolution next day , at his trial . [male] said so , and what is more , he came very near indeed to hanging for it . for king [male] xxiii , was furious . he absolutely danced with rage , and it took six prime ministers to restrain his emotion while the trial went on . [male] was tried for an attempt to murder the king .
i have known half grown rats to do the same , rats can exist a long time on herbage . if they can get nothing more palatable , it is a very common thing to find rats in the rabbit burrows when ferreting . in fact , i have seen , not once , but many times . rats , rabbits , and weasels all bolt from the same burrow . i have also unearthed a rat and a rabbit together out of one single burrow .
we all three went a common way with rather a bad [female] . and [location] in a measure dominated our movements . or at least our proposed destinations , i think she tightened her grip on all our three affections by that journey . she made [location] more of her slaves she has ever a hankering after the slave trade . has she not ? in her shrewdness she gained a grip on [location] by very diverse expedients .
in the meanwhile that princess having learned that [female] [male] was not in his apartments . and could not be found anywhere in the palace , sent some one to the château in which [male] had so long resided . to see if they could find any evidence that would convict or acquit the prince . the prudent [male] had taken care to leave nothing in it that could betray the understanding that had existed between [male] and [male] . but they found near the seat on which the prince had lain so long insensible .
he strutted about the room , he gazed at himself in every glass . he held out his hand to an imaginary [male] with ah , dear princess . and how are we this morning ? never had he felt so handsome and so sure of himself . it was in the middle of one of his pirouettings . that he caught sight of the [female] bran mash .
they spent five hours of their precious time in discussion . the officials wanted to oblige the administrator , and they had their way at last . but whether the child once admitted will have much of a time , i am inclined to doubt . should she pass into the paradise of so select an academy . i heard an ominous story of the dutch minister last week .
when midnight came , and every one was asleep , the nurse , who sat by herself . wide awake , near the cradle , in the nursery . saw the door open and the true queen come in , she took the child in her arms . and rocked it a while , and then , shaking up its pillow . laid it down in its cradle , and covered it over again .
then [female] called the argives together , and told them who he was . and all the noble deeds which he had done , and all the nobles and the yeomen made him king . for they saw that he had a royal heart . and they fought with him against [male] . and took it , and killed [male] , and made the cyclopes serve them .
love in my breast they lit and passed away forthright . far distant is the land that holds my soul 's delight . far , far from me the camp and those that dwell therein ; no visitation place again shall [location] unite . [person] and reason fled from me . when they fared forth ; sleep failed me and despair o'ercame me .
one day , however , as he was coming out of a bag of cherry stones . where he had been pilfering as usual , the boy to whom it belonged chanced to see him . `` ah , ha , my little [male] , '' said the boy . `` so i have caught you stealing my cherry stones at last , and you shall be rewarded for your thievish tricks . '' on saying this , he drew the string tight round his neck .
the king and queen and princess were safe up in their gallery . but the officers and people of the court that wor padrowling about the great [female] . when they saw the big baste coming in , gave themselves up . and began to make for doors and gates ; and the wolf licked his chops . as if he was saying , `` would not i enjoy a breakfast off a couple of yez ! ''
so it came about in a little while that the young man found himself without so much as a single penny to bless himself withal . then his fair weather friends left him , and the creditors came and seized upon his house and his household goods . and turned him out into the cold wide world to get along as best he might with the other fools who lived there . now the young [organization] was a strong , stout fellow , and , seeing nothing better to do . he sold his fine clothes and bought him a porter 's basket .
briefly , i believe in the future development of the [male] igorot for the following reasons . he has an exceptionally fine physique for his stature and has no vices to destroy his body . he has courage which no one who knows him seems ever to think of questioning . he is industrious , has a bright mind , and is willing to learn , his institutions . governmental , religious , and social -- are not radically opposed to those of modern civilization .
in the course of time he married again . and the whole house was under the hand of this wife but one room . and he himself always kept the key of that room . on a certain day of the days he forgot to take the key with him . and the second wife got into the room , what did she see there but the most beautiful woman that she ever saw .
there were princesses enough , but whether they were real princesses he could not quite make out . there was always something that did not seem quite right , so he came home again . and was quite sad : for he wished so much to have a real princess . one evening a terrible storm came on , it lightened and thundered , the rain streamed down . it was quite fearful , then there was a knocking at the town gate .
and the days came , and the days went , and yesterday was the last day . then the mill caught fire , the flames rose up high . and beat out and in , and bit at the beams and planks . and ate them up , the mill fell , and nothing remained of it but a heap of ashes . the smoke drove across the scene of the conflagration .
the king , in the hope of preventing the misfortune foretold by the old fairy . immediately sent forth a proclamation forbidding everyone . on pain of death , either to spin with a spindle . or to have spindles in their possession , fifteen or sixteen years had passed . when , the king and queen being absent at one of their country houses .
meanwhile , princess [female] and prince [male] were sitting on a heap of rubbish . crying as if their hearts would break , and the cat stood beside them wiping its great yellow eyes with its paw and looking very sorrowful . with these words , [male] arose and held his tail straight out like the handle of a saucepan . the two children took hold of it . off they all went , and in less time than it takes to tell it .
the huntsman said he wanted the old she ass to be well beaten three times a day and [organization] once . the younger one , which was the maid , beaten once and [organization] three times . the youngest of all , who was the beautiful [male] , was to be [organization] three times . and not beaten at all ; he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten . then he went back to the castle and found everything he wanted in it .
and so they did ; and the elder sister let down her hair till it hung over the witch 's eyes . so that she might believe it was her own hair growing . then the other brought a huge stone , and , in short , there was an end of the witch . the sisters were savages who had never seen a missionary , so when the sisters saw that she was dead they went to the hut . and nursed their husbands till they grew strong , then they picked up the frog .
but when all were moving , the princess saw that prince [female] stood like a pine tree that will not bend its head unless the tempest comes out of the north . so she changed from a flower to a butterfly and began a fluttering . glancing motion , and threw back her golden locks like wings . everyone watching her became very still , only prince [male] moved restlessly . and once he put his hand across his eyes as if the sun were in them .
`` some welcome visitor must have arrived , '' said the knight ; and he spurred his horse to a quicker pace over the dewy meadow . while still at some distance , they descried old [male] . busily engaged in preparing a table for the morning meal . under the trees in front of the castle gates . from all the turrets and battlements floated banners and flags in the fresh morning breeze .
so the next day [female] went and sat by the pond in the wood . waiting to be made the happiest , as the bird had promised her , all day long great flocks of birds went to and fro . and the pond became covered with seeds , [female] looked . `` why , they are poppy seeds , '' she cried , ( now poppy seeds when they are eaten make people sleep . ) just as the sun was setting all the birds began suddenly to cry in chorus .
the dwarf stood gazing at the plant , it gave out a strong sweet scent . which reminded him of the day of his enchantment . the stems and leaves were a bluish green . and it bore a dark , bright red flower with a yellow edge . so they went back to [male] 's rooms .
when the day came upon which the sentence was to be executed , it was exactly the last day of the six years . in which she might not speak or laugh ; and she had freed her dear brothers from the power of the spell . the six little shirts were finished , except that on the last one a sleeve was wanting . when she came to the place of execution . she laid the shirts on her arm .
in novgorod in the old days there was a young man . just a boy he was -- the son of a rich merchant who had lost all his money and died . so [male] was very poor , he had not a kopeck in the world . except what the people gave him when he played his dulcimer for their dancing . he had blue eyes and curling hair .
he blinked at the litter around him . and recovered his own very clumsy umbrella , beyond it lay the broad sombrero fallen from the head of [male] . and beside it a sealed business letter which . after a glance at the address , he returned to the elder [male] . on the other side of him the grass partly hid miss [female] 's sunshade .
rosy ran too , feeling as if her heart would break ; for her father was down in the mine . and would die soon if air did not come to him , the men dug as hard as they could . but it was a long job , and they feared they would not be in time . suddenly hundreds of moles came scampering along , and began to burrow down through the earth . making many holes for air to go in ; for they know how to build galleries through the ground better than men can .
at the palace [female] found that it was a difficult matter to see the king . at last , however , he was allowed to come before his presence , and at once he uncovered the cage so that the bird could be seen . the king was filled with wonder at the sight . he had never seen such a bird before , he questioned [male] and made him repeat again and again the story of how he had caught the bird . and exactly what it was that the crow had said to him .
at last he reached the light , and looked down on the scene at his feet . before him lay an open space , over which the sunlight streamed . unhindered , in golden [male] , and under this flood of [male] rested rows of pale . silent sleepers , heart to heart and arm in arm . as the rage of the ocean or the anger of the sea fairy had torn them away from their full .
then he heard something tapping at the window pane . and a thin voice said , `` let me in , and i will help you . '' it was a white dove , which sat outside the window . and was pecking at it with its beak , he opened the window . and the dove came in and set to work at once , and picked all the feathers out of the heap with its beak .
suddenly , far among the trees , as far as the sun could shine , he saw a glorious thing . it was the end of a rainbow . large and brilliant , he could count all the seven colours , and could see shade after shade beyond the violet . while before the red stood a colour more gorgeous and mysterious still , it was a colour he had never seen before . only the spring of the rainbow arch was visible , he could see nothing of it above the trees .
`` i do not wish for anything , '' said the prince . whose heart was dead within him , `` well , i will come back again , '' said the giantess , and she went away , the prince sat down in a corner . thinking and thinking , until he heard close to his ear a sound like [male] , [male] ! he looked around , and there before him was the little white cat .
he first remembers that he was going upstairs , not ordinary stairs . you know , like those in your house , no ; these stairs were quite different . they were moving all the time , as fast as he mounted one step . two and even three steps moved up , so that he was always farther and farther away from the top . he was very puzzled for some time to know what to do , so at last he stopped and repeated the magic charm .
as the old woman spoke so kindly to her , the girl took courage and agreed to enter her service . she attended to everything to the satisfaction of her [female] . and always shook her bed so vigorously that the feathers flew about like snow flakes . so she had a pleasant life with her ; never an angry word . and boiled or roast meat every day , she stayed some time with mother [female] .
' there he comes , with the sunrise , as they promised . i must die now , how shall i endure it ? oh , go , is it not dreadful enough to be torn piecemeal , without having you to look on ? and she tried to thrust him away , then she lifted up her face . and kissed him ; and [female] laughed for joy .
there came presently across the fields a whole group of children . the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be carried by the others . and when he was seated on the grass , among the yellow flowers . he laughed aloud with joy . kicked out his little legs , rolled about , plucked the yellow flowers , and kissed them in childlike innocence .
to the lord chamberlain 's door next . [male] conducted the legserpent , and let him in . now his lordship had had a bedstead made for himself . sweetly fashioned of rods of silver gilt . upon it the legserpent found him asleep .
yes , that 's a bad business , said she ; you must see if you can not get him sent to purgatory . to demand tribute , the squire therefore made his way to the men 's quarters . to speak to [male] , and it took him all his time to push his way along the walls . under the eaves , on account of the fish that filled the yard . he thanked [male] for having fished so well , and said that now he had an errand for him .
the general and his [male] lady were grand people . they had two coats of arms on their carriage . a coat of arms for each of them . and the [female] lady had had this coat of arms embroidered on both sides of every bit of linen she had . and even on her nightcap and her dressing bag , one of the coats of arms .
behind him a fierce roar indicated that the lion was in pursuit . on a desolate plain , a little shepherd boy stood alone . his day 's work was over and he had wandered through field and forest listening to the twittering of the birds and the soft sound of the summer breezes as they gently swayed the branches of the trees . he seemed to understand what the birds were saying , and the murmuring of the brook that wound its way through the forest was like a message of nature to him . sweet sounds were always in his ears , his heart was ever singing .
by and by the girl arrived at the farm . and she was engaged to look after the cows and sift the corn as her stepsister had been . but it was only when someone was watching her that she did her work . at other times the cow house was dirty , and the cows ill fed and beaten . so that they kicked over the pail , and tried to butt her ; and everyone said they had never seen such thin cows or such poor milk .
the sultan immediately returned to the city with his army . and re entered his palace victorious , amidst the acclamations of the people . who followed him in crowds , praying to heaven to prolong his life . and extolling [female] to the skies , they found [female] and her daughter in law waiting to congratulate the sultan . but words can not express the transports of joy they felt when they saw the young prince with him .
now we must go back to the king 's son after he had been put in charge of the nurse . one evening , after she had lit a candle and was holding the child . several planks sprang up in the floor of the room . and out at the opening came a beautiful woman dressed in white , with an iron belt round her waist . to which was fastened an iron chain that went down into the ground .
in the west of [male] there is a seal clan ; the clansman . calling himself after the seal , conceives himself to be of the blood of the eponym animal . in very ancient times some of the coneely clan were changed by `` art magick '' into seals and since then no member of the family can kill a seal without incurring bad luck . seals are called coneelys , and on this account it was said that many branches of the family changed their name to conolly .
`` that 's a good boy , '' said they all , and away he went . the lights were all out , and so he groped his way to the fire . and there the cat flew in his face , and tore him with teeth and claws . he let a roar out of him , and made for the room door . to look for a candle inside , he trod on the dog 's tail .
these dream visions became , however , less frequent as time passed on , and the grief of the knight was less acute . still he would probably have cherished no other wish than thus to think calmly of [female] and to talk of her . had not the old fisherman appeared one day unexpectedly at the castle . and sternly insisted on [male] 's returning with him as his child . the news of [male] 's disappearance had reached him .
prince [male] , on the twentieth day after his departure . met the same dervish in the same place as his brother [male] had done before him . he went directly up to him , and after he had saluted . asked him if he could tell him where to find the talking bird . the singing tree , and the golden water .
so her envious heart had as much repose as an envious heart can ever know . when the dwarfs came home in the evening they found [female] lying breathless and motionless on the ground . they lifted her up , searched whether she had anything poisonous about her . unlaced her , combed her hair . washed her with water and with wine .
but [female] rowed westward toward [female] , and landed , and went up to the town . and when he came , he found that [male] his grandfather had fled . for [male] his wicked brother had made war against him afresh . and had come across the river from tiryns , and conquered [male] . and [male] had fled to larissa , in the country of the wild pelasgi .
quick as lightning , and forgetful of every danger . she flew down upon them , but the waters seized her chariot and sunk it in the lowest depths . and the waves bore the wicked old woman down the stream till she was caught in some [female] bushes . where she made a good meal for all the little fishes that were swimming about . and so at last the prince and his lovely bride were free , they hurried as quickly as they could to the old king .
a [organization] , who had wasted his fortune , and had nothing left but the clothes in which he stood . saw a swallow one fine day in early spring , thinking that summer had come . and that he could now do without his coat , he went and sold it for what it would fetch . a change , however , took place in the weather . and there came a sharp frost which killed the [male] swallow .
one can hardly think of wales without a harp , the music of this most ancient and honorable instrument . which emits sweet sounds , when heard in a foreign land makes [female] folks homesick for the old country and the music of the harp . its strings can wail with woe , [female] with merriment . sound out the notes of war and peace . and lift the soul in heavenly melody , usually a player on the harp opened the eistedfodd .
there was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate , but in summer she was forced to run about with bare feet . she was so poor , and in winter wear very large wooden shoes . which made her little insteps quite red , and that looked so dangerous , on the very day her mother was buried . [female] received the red shoes , and wore them for the first time . they were certainly not intended for mourning , but she had no others .
but [female] would not give in ; she kept on begging and praying . till she got leave ; and then she ran up the stairs . so that her wooden cloak made a great clatter , out came the prince . and when he saw it was [male] . he tore the towel out of her hand .
there was once a merchant who had two children , a boy and a girl . they were both small , and not old enough to run about , he had also two richly laden ships at sea . and just as he was expecting to make a great deal of money by the merchandise . news came that they had both been lost , so now instead of being a rich man he was quite poor . and had nothing left but one field near the town .
however , he had fixed upon an admirable place to dwell in , and by and by there came other people . who chanced to have no homes ; and , seeing how pleasant a spot it was . they built themselves huts in the neighbourhood of [male] 's habitation . thus , before many years went by , a city had grown up there , in the centre of which was seen a stately palace of marble . wherein dwelt [male] , clothed in a purple robe , and wearing a golden crown upon his head .
and scarcely had she uttered the words , when there stood a little table before her covered with a white cloth . on which were arranged a plate , with a knife and fork and a silver spoon . and the most beautiful dishes , which were smoking hot , as if they had just come out of the kitchen . then little two eyes said the shortest [female] she knew . and set to work and made a good dinner , and when she had had enough .
`` and consequently you have married a governmental official , '' said [female] . and made a bow to her and to the collector , it was on twelfth night . the evening of the festival of the three kings . mother [female] lit up for [female] a three king candle . that is , a tallow candle with three wicks , which she had herself prepared .
she was sitting with her two legs stretched out . and when the king of the cats came down beside her she slipped away and sailed over the trees . `` time for me to be going , '' said the crane . and from that day to this she never came back to the house of the hag of the ashes . the king of the cats jumped down on the floor of the hag 's house and saw the hag of the ashes sitting in a corner .
he reached the forest , and it . too , vanished into thin air , while before him the pale flame steadily pursued its way . a great black cave became visible in the distance , soon the flame reached it and disappeared into its mouth . yet when the prince arrived , no cave was there , and flitting on in silence went the unresting flame . thus he was deceived again and again , for whatever he saw was found to be naught as soon as he reached it .
mr. [male] 's matrimonial speculations took a somewhat different turn . he raved to his friends about the [male] of [male] 's physical development . talked about her `` points '' as if she had been a horse . so much of cynicism always mingled with his ardor that his devotion could hardly be dignified by the name of love . he was convinced that if he could keep [female] for some years in [location] and persuade her to continue cultivating her voice .
how delightful it was to bring aid , and she possessed the means of being helpful . so , with sparkling eyes , she pressed the three gold coins into the sufferer 's burning hand . and told her that the village authorities would rear the twins for such a sum . then the parched lips of the fevered woman lauded the merciful kindness bestowed by the [female] ropedancer . who at that moment seemed to her as powerful as a queen -- so warmly and tenderly that [female] felt the blood again mount into her cheeks .
as he came nearer he struck his shield with his sword and challenged the prince to battle . the prince 's sword almost leaped out of its scabbard at the martial sound . and , like a true knight of [male] , he dashed against his foe . and swinging his sword above his head , with one blow he clove the silver helmet . and the strange warrior reeled from his horse and fell upon the golden bridge .
her eyes brightened , she gazed earnestly at the sea and the sky . her hands were folded , and i think she prayed . `` our father , '' she herself could not understand the feeling that swept through her . but i know that this minute , and the beautiful natural scene , will live within her memory for years . far more vividly and more truly than the painter could portray it with his colours on paper .
as soon as [female] was firmly settled on his son 's shoulders . [male] , feeling sure of himself . threw himself into the water and began to swim , the sea was as smooth as oil . the moon shone brilliantly , and the dog fish was sleeping so profoundly that even a cannonade would have failed to wake him . whilst [male] was swimming quickly towards the shore he discovered that his father .
he brought them home and carried them into the warehouse secretly . and without his wife 's knowing anything about it . then he again opened [male] jar . and having emptied it of its contents , he filled it with fresh olives and replaced the cover in such a way that no one . looking at it , would have known it had been disturbed , he then threw the spoiled olives away and hid the gold in a secret place known only to himself .
he slept so soundly , however , that he was not conscious , and only awoke when he was in the cow 's mouth . `` ah , goodness , '' exclaimed he , `` however came i into this mill ? '' but soon he saw where he really was , then he took care not to come between the teeth . but presently slipped quite down the cow 's throat , `` there are no windows in this room , '' said he to himself , and no [male] .
the path became steeper and more rugged every moment ; and the high hill air . instead of refreshing him , seemed to throw his blood into a fever . the noise of the hill cataracts sounded like mockery in his ears . they were all distant , and his thirst increased every moment . another hour passed , and he again looked down to the flask at his side .
these great trees , the lepidodendrons , the sigillarias . and the calamites , together with large tree ferns , are the chief plants that we know of in the coal forests . it seems very strange at first that they should have been so large when their descendants are now so small . but if you look at our chief plants and trees now . you will find that nearly all of them bear flowers .
percinet advised her to pretend illness on account of the cruel treatment she was supposed to have received . which so delighted [female] , that she got well all the sooner . and the marriage was celebrated with great splendour , soon after , the king . who knew that his wife 's weak point was her vanity . gave a tournament , at which he ordered the six bravest knights of the court to proclaim that queen [female] was the fairest lady alive .
when the day was about to dawn , the elves said to the man . you are a very jolly companion , and must come out and have a dance with [location] again . you must make [location] a promise . and keep it , so the elves , thinking to bind the man over to return . took a large [male] that grew on his forehead and kept it in pawn .
northern mythologists thus explain this very ancient fable , [female] is the earth . and the wife of [female] , the heaven or atmosphere . her hair is the trees , bushes , and plants . that adorn the surface of the earth , [female] is the fire god . that delights in mischief , bene servit , male imperat .
then he took the princess by both hands . and they danced with all the little goblins and jack o' lanterns in the room . the red spiders sprang here and there on the walls quite as merrily , and the flowers of fire appeared as if they were throwing out sparks . the owl beat the drum , the crickets whistled and the grasshoppers played the mouth organ . it was a very ridiculous ball , after they had danced enough .
when they saw these things they all knew that what the wise woman had told them was true . they were not far from their beloved moon , but , being mighty feared of bogles and the other evil things . they all went down on their knees in the mud and said the lord 's prayer . once forwards , in keeping with the cross , and once backwards to keep off the horrors of the darkness . all this they said in their minds , without saying a word aloud .
but one day [female] was sitting in front of the house . spinning and humming a little song , for she was in good spirits . the day was fine , and her husband , [female] , had ridden away across the country . and as she sat there , there came along the road a little old man . who was carrying a great heavy sack , and she could hear him panting from a long way off .
anjuta had become quite silent , why was the kind gentleman so angry all of a sudden ? the sledge had already reached the wood , suppose a stray wolf attacked her . or she lost her way ? there would be no one to help her , his imagination continued to conjure up ever darker and darker images . he saw her little body writhing under the claws of a hungry wild beast .
i now attempted to rise , for i felt myself stronger . the keys of a little chest near my bed were given me . and in it i found all my effects , i put on my clothes . fastened my botanical case round me , wherein , with delight . i found my northern lichens all safe -- put on my boots -- and leaving my note on the table .
now the nobleman to whom this castle belonged was a young and handsome count named [male] . his father was dead and his mother was anxious to see him married . but never yet had the count seen any lady who attracted him sufficiently . at last the old countess decided to give a ball for the count . and to invite to it all the most beautiful ladies from the country round .
in character [female] was harmless , but he made mischief unless every place was left open at night . he was fed with warm milk by the dairy maid . a native of the shetland isles writes me that [male] was well known in that locality . he worked about the barn , and at night ground with the handmill for those to whom he was attached . he could grind a bag or two of grain in a night .
so [female] went to the mountains , and he scaled the loftiest pinnacle . hoping that there at last he might hear no more of that king whom none had ever seen . and as he stood upon the pinnacle , what a mighty panorama was spread before him . and what a mighty anthem swelled upon his ears , the peopled plains . with their songs and murmurings , lay far below ; on every side the mountain peaks loomed up in snowy grandeur .
the long and terrible war which the king was forced to carry on against the english . and which ended in the treaty of bretigny in 1361 , gave rise to the introduction of taxation of extreme severity . the dues on ecclesiastical properties were renewed and maintained for several years . all beverages sold in towns were taxed , and from four to six deniers in the pound were levied upon the value of all merchandise sold in any part of the kingdom . the salt tax , which [male] le bel had established .
and on the third morning [female] went to the brink of the sea . and he saw the young man coming , and he drew up his boat on the shore . and asked him would he play cards . and they played , and [male] won the game . and the young man bade him give his claim .
nevertheless , everychild was not at all sure that he was glad to see her . the mask she wore really did give her a very strange appearance . still , he faced [male] with a certain proud bearing . `` that is it , '' he said , and then he turned about again to look at the masked lady . for he had noted that there was something strange about her appearance .
but on his arrival at the junction of the three ways . being confounded at the sight of the inscriptions , he had halted . not knowing where to proceed , great was his joy on discovering the prince advancing towards that face of the pyramid on which was engraved . `` whoever travels this road will probably never return , '' when the raptures of meeting and mutual congratulations were over . the prince informed the sultan of his wonderful and successful adventures .
at last [female] gnawed a hole through the baseboard large enough for her to get through into the pantry . and then her disappointment was great to find the bread jar covered over with a tin pan . it was now nearly daylight , so she decided to leave the attack upon the flour barrel until the next night . and gathering up for the children a few crumbs that were scattered about , she ran back into the wall and scrambled up to her nest . [female] and dickory and dock were very glad to get the crumbs .
once upon a time there were three bears , who lived together in a house of their own in a wood . one of them was a little , small , wee bear ; and one was a middle sized bear . and the other was a great , huge bear , they had each a pot for their porridge . a little pot for the little , small , wee bear ; and a middle sized pot for the middle bear . and a great pot for the great , huge bear , and they had each a chair to sit in .

`` no more , '' said the stranger , forcing the bottle into [male] 's hand . then he moved swiftly off after the cow , well , [male] , rather sick at heart . retraced his steps toward his cabin , and as he went he could not help turning his head to look after the little man . but he had vanished completely , he can t belong to this earth , exclaimed [male] in horror to himself .

yanek put the table on his back . stole away from the castle , and soon found himself in the forest . he strolled leisurely through the forest , and after no long time was in the open field . here an old grandfather met him , and asked if he had not something to eat . `` 't is long since i have had a bit in my mouth , ''
for the whole day they wandered through meadows and forests . till in the evening they reached a house . the young fellow knocked at the door and asked the old man who opened it if he could rest there that night . adding that he had no money to pay for it . `` then i must give it to you , '' answered the man .
and she sang to them a lullaby so surpassing sweet that the sea birds hushed their cries and flocked to listen to the sad , slow music . and when [female] and [female] and [female] were lulled to sleep . [female] 's notes grew more and more faint and her head drooped . and soon she too slept peacefully in the warm sunlight , but few were the sunny days on the sea of moyle . and many were the tempests that ruffled its waters , still keener grew the winter frosts .
the [male] was like to have had a fit in the furiousness of his rage . he took his poor wife , buried her up to the waist in the ground . and commanded throughout the city that every passer-by should strike her on the head with a stone . but no sooner had the evil witch got hold of the two children . than she took them a long way outside the town .

their words rejoiced [female] 's heart . and he waited impatiently till evening should come and he could rub the precious dew on his sightless eyes . at last it began to grow dusk , and the sun sank behind the mountains . gradually it became cooler on the hill . and the grass grew wet with dew , then [male] buried his face in the ground till his eyes were damp with dewdrops .

the children of superior abilities , who as we have seen had been taught to read and write . had a much more elaborate education , the properties of plants and their healing qualities formed an important branch of study . there were no recognized physicians in those days -- every educated man knew more or less of medicine as well as of magnetic healing . chemistry , mathematics and astronomy were also taught . the training in such studies finds its analogy among ourselves .

they drove on and on through the forest , and at last came out from among the trees into the open country . a broad , flat plain stretching to the river , far away they could see the big square sail of a boat . swelled out in the light wind , and they knew that there was the river . on the banks of which stood the village , they could see a small clump of trees . and , as they came nearer , the pale green cupolas of the white village church rising above the tops of the birches .

the [female] igorot has a keen instinct for a bargain . but his importance as a comerciante has been small , since his wants are few and the state of feud is such that he can not go far from home . his bargain instinct is shown constantly , the [location] stranger is charged from two to ten times the regular price for things he wishes to buy . early in [male] of the last two years the price of palay for the [location] has . on a plea of scarcity , advanced 20 per cent .

this story is repeated in various forms in the fairy tales of other lands . the hair which the princess changed into a scythe is like the sword of sharpness which appears in scandinavian legends and in the tale of [female] the giant killer . the transformation of the magician reminds [location] of the changes of the ogre in [female] in boots . and the death of the princess by fire because she failed to eat up the last of the pomegranate seeds . brings to mind the greek myth of [female] , who ate pomegranate seeds .
the doughty deeds and [male] experiences of [male] are perhaps . like those of [male] and his merry men . rather traditional than historical ; but even if all or part of the deeds which popular belief ascribes to him be false . his story conveys a true picture of manners and customs . above all , the manner of the vengeance which he wreaked upon the wife who had dishonoured him .

her sisters , who only concealed their delight by the affectation of a sentiment of horror . as they perceived the hour approach for beauty 's departure . were frightened to death lest anything should occur to delay her ; but beauty . firm in her resolution , knowing whither duty called her . and having no more time to lose , if she would prolong the existence of the beast .
king [male] then told them how [male] was going to do them a good deal of good . and had already found a hill of potatoes and a cave where they could live so that they might have no fear of animals or birds of prey . queen [female] was very much overjoyed , and extremely grateful to [female] for saving her husband from the hawk . about which he had just told her , and as soon as they had had sufficient to eat she asked to see the cave .

'' but this did not comfort poor [female] , who went sorrowfully into her house , shut the door . and would have had a good cry herself , if the baby had not been crying so hard that she had more than she could do to take care of him .
with [female] [male] in his arms he started toward a rear door . while after him came [male] and wolfinger bearing the crib in which [male] . violet , and daffodil rattled about like dried peas in a pod . the others followed slowly and reluctantly in their wake , casting longing glances backward at the tempting looking desserts on the table . the imps , however , did not budge , but continued eating , when [male] called out to them in angry tones they sprang up and attempted at the same time to jam [male] russe into their gaping mouths .

the old man seized her hands eagerly , but no time was given him to ask any questions . for the [male] drew him into the house . and set food before him , and waited on him herself . while he was eating , the damsel and her maids took their lutes . and sang and danced to him , and altogether the hours passed so swiftly that the old man never saw that darkness had come .

by this artifice , the cunning magician led [male] some way into the country . and as he meant to carry him farther , pretending to be tired , he took an opportunity to sit down in one of the gardens on the brink of a fountain of clear water . which discharged itself by a lion 's mouth of bronze into a basin . come , nephew , said he , you must be weary as well as i . let [location] rest ourselves , and we shall be better able to pursue our walk .
when the sun was high in the east , people began to come in at the park gate . and the blind bowler , his first duty done . joined [location] on the palace steps . more people came , and the park began to be filled with them . they came before long in a steady stream , and at length the park was crowded with a great multitude .
odin had conquered , the noblest of the land were killed in the inglorious victory of that night . and the weak remnant of the giant race were obliged to leave their old home and seek a refuge in unknown lands . notwithstanding this ignoble beginning , [female] 's reign was one of wisdom . power , and beneficence , of [female] and her husband nothing more was ever heard . whether the sea had swallowed the boat in its hungry depths .
he felt that the day that had begun so freezingly was warm , strangely warm . he wiped the tears from his eyes away to the side of his face with his sleeve . and looked about , the sun was very bright , but in a mild , pleasant way . and a tree on the other side of the street was showering softly . softly , softly , yellow autumn leaves , until they covered the cobblestones all around .
now , everything went happily until the lovely princess was eighteen years old . and then something fearful happened , a terrible and cruel war broke out between the king . her father , and a neighbouring emperor , and alas , the king got the worst of it . he lost every battle from the very beginning ; town after town fell into the hands of the enemy . the happy villages were burnt down ; the crops and the cattle were seized .
he dismounted and toiled on , with bridle on arm . praying and casting himself on the [male] of heaven . then his horse fell and surrendered its life to god , on and on he went across the sandy waste . weeping and with burning breast , till at length a hill rose into sight . he mustered his strength and climbed to the top , and there he found a giant tree whose foot kept firm the wrinkled earth .
the wind whirled the faded , fallen leaves ; the snow drifted in the valleys . as well as upon the mountains , and the ice [female] sat in the stately palace which . in winter time , she generally occupied . the perpendicular rocks were covered with slippery ice , and where in summer the stream from the rocks had left a watery veil . icicles large and heavy hung from the trees , while the snow powdered fir trees were decorated with fantastic garlands of crystal .
the ogress came slowly and gently along , stretching out her hands before her . so that she might not fall against anything unawares . for she had only a tiny lantern slung at her waist . which did not give much light , and when she reached the place where the sisters were lying . she stooped down and held a corner of the cloth up to the lantern , yes !
as he was very tired , and the night was very dark , the prince determined not to wander further . so he asked the old woman if he might spend the night beside her fire . very well , said the prince , i [female] ', t mind ', . and she stretched out her [female] and hit the beasts . and in one moment they were turned into stone .
meanwhile [male] returned home , but [male] did not come . and so he said , oh , what a prudent [female] i have ! she is so industrious that she does not even come home to eat anything . by and by , however , evening came on , and still she did not return . so [female] went out to see how much she had reaped ; but , behold , nothing at all .
the baby was so [female] looking that [female] did not much care to handle it . but still she had come there as a nurse , and she would do what was required of her . the little man showed her where the kitchen was . and she heated some water and then went back to the bedroom and took up the baby to wash it . but so strange it all seemed , and she felt so shaken up by her ride that she was awkward in handling the child .
in her happiness she did not forget the little [female] . who was her friend in sorrow , she took him home with her to sunny valleys . and every day she fed him with her own hands . and every day he sang for her the sweetest songs that were ever heard in lady 's bower . a long , long time ago , in a valley far away , the giant [male] lived in a great castle .
[male] slept all that night and through the following day . darkness was again spreading over the world when at last he woke . he sat up , looking about him , trying with his numbed brain to grasp his whereabouts . the door of the hut stood wide open and close before it a big fire had been lit . its crackling reminded [male] , with a pang .
colors with a tone of yellow in them are easier to use than cold blues and greens and violets . for the yellow tinge , be it ever so little , brings them into relation with the majority of woods used in floors and furniture frames . light colors make a room seem larger by apparently making the walls recede . and dark colors make it seem smaller , as they make [location] conscious of the walls and so seem to bring them nearer . any very bright room may have dark walls to soften the glare .
as [female] stood on the shore and watched the uncouth sea creatures . serpents , nicors , monstrous beasts of all kinds . he suddenly drew his bow and shot one of them to the heart . the rest darted furiously away , and the thanes were able to drag the carcase of the slain beast on shore . where they surveyed it with wonder .
this was the only consideration that made her wish to be like other people , another reason for her being fond of the water was that in it alone she enjoyed any freedom . for she could not walk without a cortege , consisting in part of a troop of light horse . for fear of the liberties which the wind might take with her . and the king grew more apprehensive with increasing years , till at last he would not allow her to walk abroad at all without some twenty silken cords fastened to as many parts of her dress . and held by twenty noblemen , of course horseback was out of the question .
then they took each other by the hand , and went forth from the great palace of ice . they spoke of the grandmother , and of the roses on the roof . and as they went on the winds were at rest . and the sun burst forth . when they arrived at the [male] with red berries .
and [male] 's heart was softened and he forgave his wife . and they lived happily together ever after , and his old mother came and lived with him . and he never parted with [male] and [male] . and i need hardly tell you that he never again let the ring out of his possession . a young prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him .
[male] , from his lofty hermitage , had an excellent opportunity to observe this ever changing panorama of earth and sky . but it had lost its charm to him . the long , cool vistas between the cloud banks no more lifted the mind above itself . pointing the way into a great and glorious future , a vague dread was perpetually haunting him . he feared that [male] did not love him as he wished to be loved .
it was [female] 's museum . `` how it shines and glitters , '' said the [female] sparrow . `` this must be the beautiful , -- tweet , -- only this is larger than a peacock . '' she remembered what her mother had told them in her childhood . that the peacock was one of the greatest examples of the beautiful .
`` give me your swords , '' said [male] from behind them . `` for neither of you has vanquished the other , '' and [male] turned and put his arms round [male] 's neck . the next day [male] would have given orders to his men to make ready to go back whence they came . but [male] stopped him , so they rode to the castle of the countess of the fountain . and spent three months in resting and feasting , and when it was time for them to depart [female] besought the countess that she would allow [female] to go with him to [location] for the space of three months .
the abbot went away very sad and in great fear , he first rode to [male] . here was a great school , called a u ni ver´si ty , and he wanted to see if any of the wise pro fess ors could help him . but they shook their heads , and said that there was nothing about king [male] in any of their books . then the abbot rode down to cam bridge , where there was another u ni ver si ty , but not one of the teachers in that great school could help him . at last , sad and sor row ful , he rode toward home to bid his friends and his brave knights good by .
`` attend to your business , '' said iron nose , and then locked herself in her apartment . [female] opened the covered enclosure , threw himself on one of the metal horses and rushed out with the whole troop . they were no sooner on the meadow . when the horse on which he rode threw him into a deep morass . where he sank up to the breast , the whole troop scattered themselves here and there .
`` good , '' said he , and rising on his perch , fluttered his wings . immediately there appeared before [male] a table spread with a fine cloth and having upon it the best supper her eyes had ever looked on . so [female] married the white bird and lived in the palace cave . and for a long time her days were full of wonder and delight . there seemed no end to the treasures around her .
noureddin did as [male] advised , to the great wrath of [male] . who riding straight at him endeavoured to take the beautiful persian from him by force . [female] letting her go , seized [female] 's horse by the bridle . and , encouraged by the applause of the bystanders , dragged him to the ground . beat him severely , and left him in the gutter streaming with blood .
upon their tumultuous and angry surges a large vessel , heavily laden , was being driven towards the bay of [female] by the fierce tempest . if that fine ship , which bore on her bosom the rich merchandise of continental skill and industry . be dashed against the desperate assemblage of rocks , crags , and shoals surrounding the bay—imagination with its utmost stretch could form but a very imperfect idea of so direful and so appalling a spectacle . as the villagers gazed upon the tumultuous billows , they saw the ship . which had battled many a stormy breeze , uplifted on the briny surge .
within it he found the ring which he had given to the queen . inside of which were written words which no one but he and she knew . `` where did this come from ? '' said he ; but nobody could tell him . `` where the ring came from , '' said he , `` there will the queen be found. '' and up he got from his bed and dressed himself .
the quotation is an overworked quotation , like many another of those from hamlet . yet , have half of those whose lips utter it more than the vaguest acquaintance with the story of [female] and the cause of her tears ? the noble group -- attributed to [female] -- of [female] and her last remaining child . in the uffizi palace at [female] , has been so often reproduced that it also has helped to make the anguished figure of the theban queen a familiar one in pictorial tragedy . so that as long as the works of those titans of art .
trollope never visited la vendée , his story is based primarily on the memoirs of madame de la rochejacquelin . who appears in the book with the name of her first husband , [female] lescure . she subsequently married the younger brother of henri [male] and bore him eight children before he was killed in a second vendean revolt in 1815 . among the fictional characters were [male] and [male] denot . how would [male] end his story of this disaster ?
they ascended afterwards to the store rooms . where they could not sufficiently admire the number and elegance of the tapestries . the beds , the sofas , the cabinets . the stands , the tables , and the mirrors in which they could see themselves from head to foot . and that had frames some of glass , some of silver , and some of gilt metal .
orangine , in place of being touched by this generous sentiment and hoping to play her sister a malicious trick . now insisted upon her singing , [female] for some time modestly refused . her sisters , who supposed that she did not know how to sing , were insistent . the queen herself , desiring to humiliate poor [female] . joined her entreaties to those of [female] and [female] and in fact commanded the young princess to sing .
then he blew in my face , and was gone , and when i looked around . my right eye was blind , and from that day to this i have never seen a blink with my anointed eye . up the airy mountain , down the rushy glen , we daren t go a hunting for fear of little men . wee folk , good folk .
then he took the other kettle off the fire . filled the new one with water , and put it in its place . when [male] arrived , the old man told him that he had something which he wished to get rid of . and lifted the lid of the wooden chest , where he had shut up the tanuki . but , to his surprise , no tanuki was there , nothing but the kettle he had found in the corner .
it is now time that the story of sir [male] should be told . how he was bred up in the ways of justice . now this story , as it was commonly reported , was this : astraa , who was the goddess of justice . found him when he was a child playing with other children of a like age . she , liking him well , and finding him innocent and without guile .
i also hastened away with the basket , for it appeared to me that affairs were coming to a crisis . i heard people running different ways , and voices approaching me . when i emerged from the narrow avenue , i perceived several figures coming down the dark walk at a rapid pace . and , seized with a sort of panic , i took to my heels . i soon found that they were in pursuit .
i am very well pleased that the grecian king , says [male] . had so much firmness of spirit as to reject the false accusation of his vizier . if you commend the firmness of that prince today . says [male] , you will as much condemn his weakness tomorrow . if the sultan be pleased to allow me time to finish this story .
by the king 's side sat his daughter . a very beautiful lady , she ordered one of the attendants to give [female] a good cup of cream . which she liked very much ; and she went home and told her master all she had done . the miller 's son laughed ; but every morning [male] caught a rabbit . and carried it to the palace with the same message .
so [female] promised to do all for [female] , and next night at midnight she took her stand by miles cross and cast a compass round her with holy water . soon there came riding by the elfin court , first over the mound went a troop on black steeds . and then another troop on brown , but in the third court . all on milk white steeds , she saw the queen of elfland . and by her side a knight with a star in his crown .
the king and queen embraced each other , and she told him the whole story . how the witch came to the ship when they were all asleep and sent her off in the boat . after she had gone so far that she could not see the ship . she sailed on through darkness until she landed beside a three headed giant . the giant wished her to marry him .
leaving the camel kneeling at the entrance for [female] to dismount . the negro knocked loudly at the door , which was opened by the youngest brother . all the others being away hunting , he did not of course recognise [male] . but he knew the negro and his wife . and welcomed them gladly , adding , `` but who does the other negress belong to ? ''
so they took him out to the paddock where the hares were . all morning he herded them there as his brother had done before him . and that was an easy task , but it was in the afternoon that the trouble began . for no sooner did the fresh wind of the hillside ruffle up their fur than away they fled . this way and that , kicking up their heels behind them .
nowhere could he find the smallest plant or flower out of which to wind her a final wreath the same as those she had always worn . in vain he searched each sheltered corner . wherever he peered , all was dark and dead , killed by the frost of the night . when he came back to where she lay , pale and still . all that he had to bring to the woman he loved was a crown of thorns .
at which he was surprised , especially at the account of the cap . the drum , and the ball ; of which last [male] begged his acceptance . being now near home , and having no farther occasion for its use . [male] al sulleeb was much pleased . and entertained him magnificently for three days , when [male] wishing to depart .
leo watched them with eager eyes . beautiful as the sight was , he yet was oppressed with fear . for he knew not how to reveal himself to these sportive beings . and he could not imagine how he should ever be released from his imprisonment . suddenly the dancers fled as if pursued , the music became martial , and the steady tramp of a host of elves was heard .
he came into this country like a mad man . with dogs and boys chasing him . and by miracle he was brought into his wit again . if ye list to come into the castle , ye must ride unto the farther side of the isle . and there ye shall find a vessel that will bear you and your horse .
prince [male] coloured , and , for a moment . he had a struggle with himself not to say that as he had now got a meal . he did not intend to do any more work ; but [male] had taught him wisdom . so he expressed his willingness to do what he was bidden . only hinting that he should be better up to his work , if he could be allowed a few hours ', sleep .
and the young king plucked a spray of wild [male] that was climbing over the balcony . and bent it , and made a circlet of it . and set it on his own head , and thus attired he passed out of his chamber into the great hall . where the nobles were waiting for him , and the people laughed and said . `` it is the king 's fool who is riding by , ''
we prepared ourselves without a stay . and we took our leave of the virgin . we were sorrowful and sad after her , and not less after [location] was the refulgent maid . we turned our backs on the fortress . and our horse under [location] in full speed .
she had for defence of her body a cuirass of chain mail . buskins she had , finely embroidered with bars of gold . at her side she had a scimitar hanging to a most gorgeous belt . her shield was finely decked with precious stones , it was like the moon when it is at the full . in this guise she came out of the city gate .
and twenty of the strongest fairies brought [male] 's hump and put it down upon poor [male] 's back . over his own , where it became fixed as firmly as if it was nailed on with twelvepenny nails by the best carpenter that ever drove one . out of their castle they then kicked him . and in the morning , when [female] madden 's mother and her gossip came to look after their little man . they found him half dead .
whereupon she witched him , and he fell ill . and was cured as we have seen , when he got well he watched the old witch . and saw she often visited the house of an old miser who lived near by with his beautiful niece . now all the people in the village touched their hats most respectfully to this old miser . for they knew he had dealings with the witch .
having obtained this information , the two eireks started , furnished with letters from the greek emperor . on emerging from the forest , the two eireks came upon a strait . separating them from a beautiful land , which was unmistakably paradise . and the danish [male] , intent on displaying his scriptural knowledge . pronounced the strait to be the river pison .
these amicable relations between the brothers were , however , sometimes interrupted , thus , for instance . upon one occasion [male] joined [male] and [male] in a secret conspiracy to seize upon the ruler of heaven . place him in fetters . and deprive him of the sovereign power , the conspiracy being discovered . [male] , as the chief instigator of this sacrilegious attempt on the divine person of [female] .
other gifts besides tobacco came in the same way to the side of the lodge . sometimes a whole bear , then a wampum robe , then a string of birds . and the sand spirits altogether led an easy life ; for they were not at the trouble to hunt or clothe themselves . and whenever the housekeeping began to fall short , nothing would happen but a wonderful storm of dust . all the sand hills being straightway put in an uproar , and the contributions would at once begin to pour in at the side windows of the lodge .
he had always lived in such a glow of brightness that no darkness had ever touched him . but one morning , after [male] and [male] had gone . [male] 's face was sad and troubled , he walked slowly from room to room in his palace breidablik . stainless as the sky when [male] showers have swept across it because no impure thing had ever crossed the threshold . and his eyes were heavy with sorrow , in the night terrible dreams had broken his sleep .
for some time [female] behaved so well that the ring did not prick at all . but one day when he returned from the chase . having caught nothing , he felt so ill humoured , that when his dog [male] came fawning upon him . he kicked the poor , faithful creature from him . at that moment the ring pricked like a pin running into his finger .
now , three days journey from the hut on the pastures two brothers sodno dwelt in a small cottage with their sister [female] . who tended a large herd of reindeer while they were out hunting . of late it had been whispered from one to another that the three young stalos were to be seen on the pastures . but [organization] did not disturb themselves , the danger seemed too far away . unluckily , however , one day , when [female] was left by herself in the hut .
deeper than the love of home , of wife . of kindred , of lands and possessions , was his affection for wild wales and its people . of all countries in the wide world , wales was to him the brightest and fairest . and its people the bravest and best , for her welfare , he sacrificed all he had . all he possessed ; and at last his life was immolated on his dear country 's shrine .
b.b , was aware that it would be impossible for him to keep his little [male] any longer in frozen nose 's dominions . indeed , he had only hidden her in the hall until he could decide what course to pursue . for he knew only too well that [male] , in seeking revenge . would be sure to discover his secret , and do all he could to injure him . personally he had little to fear , but the punishment for mortals entering frozen nose 's realm was death .
so she got into the carriage and drove away with the king . and when they arrived at his palace , the wedding was celebrated with great pomp . as the little men had granted to the [female] , when a year was over . the young queen bore a son , and as the step mother had heard of her great good fortune . she came with her daughter to the palace and pretended that she wanted to pay her a visit .
one day she had taken a longer stroll than usual . and suddenly came upon a part of the wood which she never remembered to have seen before . somehow or other , she had strayed out of the path . and all around her were tangled masses of [female] , old pollard trees bowed down to the ground by age and the weight of their branches . and thickets of thorns and brambles .
before long people began to wonder what had come over the king , he never went near the royal forest . and when he was not in the kitchen garden he was in the library . looking for books that would tell him the difference between a banana and a turnip and the best place to find a cauliflower . the chief huntsman and all the other huntsmen had never been so dull in their lives . but the wild boars and all the other animals were as happy as the day was long .
it was the memory of a boyhood escapade that had at the time caused unusual remorse . shame , and fear of discovery . he had fancied that others could read in his eyes what he had done . he became afraid to look at people or to have them look at him . awkwardness , embarrassment , bashfulness grew apace .
upon this the soldiers let him go , and , seizing me . refused to listen to my remonstrances , or to my account of the manner in which i had found the [male] . they dragged me along with them . and having put fetters on my feet , thrust me into a dungeon . saying , `` there are your companions , '' pointing at the same time to some other prisoners confined in that place .
there was once , it may be now many hundred years ago , a good old fisherman . who was sitting one fine evening before his door , mending his nets , the part of the country in which he lived was extremely pretty . the greensward , on which his cottage stood , ran far into the lake . and it seemed as if it was from love for the blue clear waters that the tongue of land had stretched itself out into them . while with an equally fond embrace the lake had encircled the green pasture rich with waving grass and flowers .
father brown , even when he was mystified , was clever in analysing his own mystification . and he found himself reflecting that the oddity seemed to consist in a particular shape cut out in an incongruous material . as if one saw a top hat made of tin , or a frock coat cut out of tartan . he was sure he had seen timbers of different tints arranged like that somewhere . but never in such architectural proportions , the next moment a glimpse through the dark trees told him all he wanted to know and he laughed .
baby slept a great deal , for life offered him few pleasures . and like a small philosopher , he wisely tried to forget the troubles which he could not cure . so [male] had nothing to do but sing , and try to imagine how the world looked . she had no one to tell her . and the few memories grew dimmer and dimmer each year .
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . merely to the illustration of your character , i am trying to make it out . but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity . yes , and therefore we resent these falsehoods and this presumption on the part of [male] . but , really , considering his descent , we could not expect much better , he has evidently forgotten to tell you that he is the son of old [male] .
they made three parts of that night . the first part they spent in conversation . the second in telling tales , the third in eating and drinking . with sound sleep and sweet slumber , as early as the day dawned next morning the old woman was up . and had food for the young men , when the three had eaten , she spoke to ur .
he took her to his summer palace . where he prepared a great feast in her honour . to the feast were bidden all the highest of the land , princes and lords and ladies of high estate . and , willy nilly , to the summer palace they all repaired . where was the mikado , [male] and wild , and mad with love .
his way home lay across the moor of catstean . and the point at which he best knew the passage was from the churchyard of shackleton . he vaulted the low wall that forms its boundary , and strode across the graves . and over many a flat , half buried tombstone , toward the side of the churchyard next catstean moor . the old church of shackleton and its tower rose .
you see , those two were old friends of hers . they came from fairyland originally , but the tale went that a wicked witch had cast a spell over them which was to last for seven hundred and seventy seven years . at the end of that time they would be able to go back to fairyland . but meanwhile the queen used to come and visit them now and then in order to cheer them up . sure enough , the very next time she came , the flower seller remembered about the little clock and told her how unhappy it was .
so does a bear stand over the carcase of an ox . and seem to pause awhile to hear its piteous crying , when sir [male] saw what had befallen sir turpine . he made all haste to help him . and dealt the queen so mighty a blow that it reft her of her senses . nay , but that she somewhat broke its force , for she was expert in arms .
for he knew that the best thing of all was to be found there , he saw the hills far away . purple and blue , with here and there a streak of [male] where the sun was shining on the heather . as he came nearer and nearer he grew happier and happier , for a fairy is always happiest in his own country . he picked a sprig from his own tuft of heather . and then he flew down to the shore to meet the sea fairy at the edge of the ripples .
the next morning the queen and the prince and all the court went out to hunt . and a [male] white deer started out before them . and [organization] pressed after him in pursuit . the prince 's steed outstripped the others . and when he was alone the prince flung the reins upon his horse 's neck .
lacquered furniture is more formal than the average painted furniture , and often one or two pieces are sufficient for a room . a beautiful lacquered cabinet with its fascinating mounts and its soft . wonderful red or black and gold tones is a thing to conjure with . lacquered furniture is lovely for some dining rooms and morning rooms . the tables should always be protected with glass tops .
with that he pulled the bracelet from his waistband . and handed it to his friend , the merchant was naturally much astonished . but said nothing , and made no objection to carrying out his friend 's plan . time passed by , and at length the merchant arrived in the course of his travels at the capital of khaistan . as soon as he had opportunity he presented himself at the palace .
over marshland , through thickets , across streams and up ravines this strange pair wandered . the bird seemingly choosing the safest path for her companion . and growing ever more insistent in her cries of `` vengeance , vengeance ! '' at last they came to the summit of a hill some distance from the palace . utterly weary the harper ventured to stop and rest , and the bird 's voice was heard no more .
the parents being dead and gone , the children home he takes . and brings them straight unto his house , where much of them he makes . he had not kept these pretty babes a twelvemonth and a day . but , for their wealth , he did devise to make them both away . he bargained with two ruffians strong , which were of furious mood .
that was enough to set the prince on fire for the adventure . in fact , he felt in his heart that he was the chosen one . he did not delay for an instant , no sooner had he taken a step toward the wood than the trees great and small . and the thorns and briars , disentangled themselves and opened a path . he walked toward the castle which stood at the end of a broad avenue .
feeling quite strong , the king rose and walked about amongst them , wrapped in his ermine robe . with his red crown on his head , and his diamond sceptre in his hand . every group of shadows to which he drew near . ceased talking as soon as they saw him approach . but at a nod they went on again directly , conversing and relating and commenting .
`` oh , it needs no pondering , '' cried the queen joyfully . holding up her clasped hands , and making [female] do likewise , in token of gratitude . but in order that he may know that you have come from me i will send him a letter . and pricking her arm , she wrote a few words with her blood on the corner of her handkerchief . then tearing it off , she gave it to the frog .
the great king of the west held uncontrolled sway from the island of rathlin to the mouth of the shannon by sea . and far as the glittering length by land . the ancient king of the west , whose name was [male] . was good as well as great , and passionately loved by his people , his queen was a breaton princess . and was equally beloved and esteemed , because she was the great counterpart of the king in every respect .
the wise woman , therefore , one day walked up to the door of the shepherd 's cottage . dressed like a poor woman , and asked for a drink of water . the shepherd 's wife looked at her . liked her , and brought her a cup of milk . the wise woman took it .

now [female] twist knew butter from cheese . as the saying is , she knew that the green salve was of a kind which very few people have had rubbed over their eyes in this world . that it was of a kind which poets would give their ears to possess . even were it a lump no larger than a pea , so , when she took the box of red ointment . she only rubbed one eye with it .
so she hurried off to the palace of the fairy . and confided all her woes to her , the fairy embraced her tenderly , and gave her a sack full of spun flax . in order that she might show it to the king . and let him see what a good worker she was . [male] took the sack without one word of thanks .
now , whoever has stood for the first time in a great , empty castle knows that there is one thing that he longs to do above all other things . and this is to explore , and when the afternoon lay brooding upon the air . and slanting sun fell through the dusty lattices , [male] asked the old man eagerly if he might wander through the rooms . breathing the life of another time the rooms lay . as if partly remembering and partly expecting , in the king 's room was the hunting suit that he had thrown off just before the attack .
this time the water was ready and the girl did not fly away . but she and the prince promised to love each other always , then they set out for home . they soon reached the prince 's country . and as he wished to bring his promised bride back in a fine coach he went on to the town to fetch one . in the field where the well was , the king 's swineherds and cowherds were feeding their droves .

for a long time it went very well with little [male] . he had enough to eat , and but little to do ; and the old woman seemed to be perfectly satisfied with him . but , by and by , the cats began to behave very badly ; the moment the [male] went out . they ran around the rooms as if possessed , threw down every thing in confusion . and broke considerable fine crockery , which stood in their way , when , however , they heard their [female] coming up the steps .
when [male] returned from his expedition against the thebans he determined to fulfil the last injunction of his father [male] . who had desired him to be revenged on his mother [female] for her perfidy in accepting a bribe to betray him . this resolution was further strengthened by the discovery that his unprincipled mother had urged him also to join the expedition { 278 } in return for the much coveted veil of [male] . he therefore put her to death . and taking with him the ill fated necklace and veil .
the neighbours , very naturally , declined to believe his story , and tried me several times with all the bad money they could collect together . but i never failed to stand the test triumphantly , soon , the shop was filled from morning till night . with people who on the pretence of buying bread came to see if i was as clever as i was reported to be . the [male] drove a roaring trade . and admitted that i was worth my weight in gold to him .
even those deeper indiscretions , which [person] has so faithfully recorded , seem then but a wise adaptation of vile means to a noble end . and yet we know that it is not so ; for , as a matter of fact . the `` arabian nights entertainment '' is but a miscellany gathered from various sources . of various dates , and passing down to us , even in its collocated form . under widely differing versions , none but scholars can know how little of the unadulterated originals has come into our possession .
even in the most trifling details of domestic life , approval is encouraging and sweet . the weary wife and mother who has passed through a day of innumerable little vexations and difficulties . is cheered by the pleasant smile with which her husband takes his seat at the tea and feels new life as she listens to his commendations of some favourite dish which she has placed before him . true , it is but a trifle , but it speaks to the heart . we will give our readers a short specimen of the habit to which we allude .
i must do the king the justice to say that it was i . and not he , who closed the dialogue , at this juncture . i became the subject of a remarkable optical delusion . the legs of my stool appeared to me to double up . the car to spin round and round with great violence .
he reached a mountain side , where he sat down to rest . leaving his horse to graze , and [male] to run after the flies . he knew that the grotto of darkness was not far off . yet he looked about him like one who sees nothing . at last he perceived a rock , as black as ink .
a procession was formed , but i only ventured to follow as far as the door of the banqueting hall . so furious was the uproar of barking dogs within , so i sat down by the king . who seemed to have gone to sleep , and waited till the children returned to say good night . when his majesty got up and shook himself , `` time for bed ! '' he said with a sleepy yawn , `` the attendants will show you your room , ''
in fact , it is like many another scene of youthful violence . while it lasts , which fortunately is not very long ; for , by and bye , it steals calmly out in an open rivulet between green banks . as gently as if nothing had happened , and were rather ashamed of its pranks . it has now come to the place where farm steadings and plantations begin looking onward in its course . thatched roofs are seen at different points in the surrounding landscape .
they had neat little uniforms of blue and white , like figures on a tile . blue trousers and white millers smocks , and wooden shoes . and they were trained to stand in an orderly row , with big [person] at the head and [person] baby [person] at the foot . all puff cheeked , ruddy , and broad chested from much blowing , and they blew all together . one -- two , one -- two , one -- two , -- with a sound like a great wind in the chimney on a january night .
that day they held a big feast . the old wife was busy all the morning cooking all kinds of dainties . while the old man went round the village and collected the fiddlers . all the boys and girls of the village were invited . and they ate and sang and danced and had a merry time till daybreak .
but they were forest people , who live long , long lives . and see far , [female] was an earth child . and [female] was not all a forest child , so they found it hard to be wise and wait and do nothing but trust [female] and know she would return . no [female] answered , sometimes a forest child came running to say , we have not seen her yet , [female] . but we are watching , the bird fairies fluttered at the call and nodded their little heads uneasily .
at four the [female] came and knocked at the door , the dog was frightened almost to death . `` never mind , '' said the monkey , `` hide here under my bed and everything will be all right . '' the dog hid under the monkey 's bed . then the monkey invited the [male] to enter , he told . the [male] how very sick he was but the [male] was not at all sorry for him .
his eyes sparkled with life ; and a smile played upon his lips . he walked with a light and quick step . his forehead was bound with a wreath of sweet grass . in place of the warrior 's frontlet . and he carried a bunch of flowers in his hand .
there are various detailed matters of daily life which will appear under their appropriate headings . but i will here deal with a few of them , their animal food consists of wild pig and . on occasions , village pig . a small form of cassowary , kangaroo , a small kind of wallaby . kangaroo rat , `` iguana , '' an animal called gaivale ( i could not find out what this is ) .
the earliest italian tribes , who were mostly engaged in the pursuit of husbandry . regarded this deity more especially as the god of spring . who vanquished the powers of winter , and encouraged the peaceful arts of agriculture . but with the romans , who were an essentially warlike nation , [male] gradually loses his peaceful character . and , as god of war , attains , after [male] .
said the pastor , and as he stretched out his hand to protect him who already suffered too much . the scene changed , they flew through rich halls and wretched hovels . wantonness and envy , all the deadly sins . passed before them , an angel of justice read their crimes and their defence . the latter was not a brilliant one , but it was read before god .
we were going with a donkey wagon , he and i . the wagon wherein she . my other friend , was riding , he had been in the civil service . and suffered much from fever ; yet he was leaving the service for other reasons as well as that particular one . he was traveling cross-country to his exit station .
a council was called next day by the birds . they chose gah gah go wah . the [location] buzzard , to get the suits . he could fly over a long trail and not be tired , the birds told him that if he would go . he might have the first choice of the suits of feathers .
the festival was magnificent , i myself was there , and drank freely of wine and mead . and although not a drop went into my mouth , my chin was quite wet . a certain king had a beautiful garden which contained a number of very rare trees . but the most rare of all was an apple tree , it stood in the middle of the garden . and produced one golden apple every day , in the morning the [male] unfolded .
timidly the little girl took the white hand of the fairy tale in hers . it was very cold , but as she held it . it seemed to grow warm and soft in her fingers , `` speak to her , '' the queerbody now commanded , at first [female] could not think of what to say . then , are you , -- are you the forgotten story i came to find ? ', she whispered .
see the halsewell , east indiaman [female] . driving madly on a january night towards the rocks near seacombe . on the island of purbeck , the captain 's two dear daughters are aboard . and five other ladies , the ship has been driving many hours . has seven feet water in her hold .
fire flashed from his angry eyes , and his face was so terrible that the wicked sister and brother cowered and cringed before it . snatching his babies in his arms , he replaced them unharmed in the sleigh . for a moment , he seemed about to crush both culprits to fragments in his wrath . but , relenting , he pronounced their sentence -- and [male] was condemned to be the bride of the imprisoned brother . `` your fate is just , '' said the king of the north pole .
on that topic one can only repeat [male] when at his best , in his celtic literature . nor have i attempted to deal with the more general aspects of the study of the celtic folk tale . for these i must refer to mr. [male] 's series of papers in the celtic magazine , vol . xii. , or , still better , to the masterly introductions he is contributing to the series of waifs and strays of celtic tradition . and to dr. [male] 's beside the fireside .
but that fair [female] never came to athens with her husband . some say that [female] left her sleeping on naxos among the cyclades . and that [female] the wine king found her . and took her up into the sky , as you shall see some day in a painting of old [male] s—one of the most glorious pictures upon earth .
she gets aboard just in time and away it floats out into the big wide world . the king of the gnomes has a magic pipe with which he blows a wonderful bubble and taking ed . with him they both have a delightful time in gnomeland . little hero stepped aboard the wind wagon and started on a journey to many wonderful places and had a delightful time . a little old man gave [male] the magic umbrella which took him to happyland .
the dark dwarfs did not like to dig metal for swords or spears . or what would hurt people ; but the church bells would guide travellers in the forest . and quiet the storms , that destroyed houses and upset boats and killed or drowned people . besides inviting the people to come and pray and sing , they knew that the good teachers were poor and could not buy bells in [person] or [person] . even if they had money , they could not get them through the thick forests .
i fell upon his neck , astonished at sentiments so unusual . for it was very evident that he was not prompted by the love of money . my mode of life and my fate now became somewhat different . it is incredible with what provident foresight [male] contrived to conceal my deficiency . everywhere he was before me , and with me .
then the princess took a step towards him and killed him with her sword . she cut him up in pieces and washed these in pure water . after which she joined them together again and breathed upon them . instantly [male] sprang up full of life and health . and looked so handsome and bright that the old king , who was dreadfully jealous .
the moment she saw him . [male] threw herself on her face . [female] from head to foot . but the dog had no quarrel with her . and of the violence against which he always felt bound to protest in dog fashion .
the mouse gnawed a hole in the chest . and fetched out the ring , the cat put the ring in her mouth and went back to the river . where the dog was waiting for her , and swam across with her , then they started out together for home . in order to bring the lucky ring to their master and [male] . but the dog could only run along the ground ; when there was a house in the way he always had to go around it .
i drew out the black hair of the unicorn 's tail . and gave myself up to the pleasant task of sewing on the button . it was soon done , and it was well done , nothing could be more secure . i placed the doublet under my pillow and went to bed . in the morning i arose with a light heart .
he crossed many high mountains , traversed deep rivers . passed foreign countries , and at last he came to a great desert . where there was nothing to see but sky and sand , no man lived there . no animal 's voice was ever heard , no vegetable ever grew there ; the sun was shining so brightly and burning so terribly that all the rivers were dried up . their beds were lost in the sand , and there was not a drop of water anywhere .
one night , when she was lying in her pretty little bed . an old toad crept in through a broken pane in the window . she was very ugly , clumsy , and clammy . she hopped on to the table where [male] lay asleep under the red rose leaf . `` this would make a beautiful wife for my son , '' said the toad .
he was fierce and big , and he huffed and he puffed . and he puffed and he huffed , and he blew the house in . and he ate up the poor little pig , and then the third little pig went out . with his curly tail and his saucy snout . up to all kinds of pranks and tricks .
then [female] went straight to the palace and told the king that he was ready to perform the third task if he would come to the hill and see it done . [male] himself returned to the fields . and mounting on the wolf 's back he rode to the wood close by . the wicked brothers stamped and foamed with rage when they saw the failure of their wicked designs . but the king was overcome by a sudden terror when he saw the enormous pack of wolves approaching nearer and nearer .
the friendship of king [male] for [male] had largely increased in a few moments . and , as he already hoped to marry her when she was of age . and through her to reconcile men and dwarfs , he feared that [male] might at some time become his rival and disturb his plans . this is why he knit his eyebrows and walked off , drooping his head like a worried man . [male] , seeing she had vexed him .
the old woman drew [female] into the cottage . and spoke kindly to her , but the [female] 's heart sank . for a peat fire smouldered on the hearth and the room was filled with smoke . there was no easy chair , no couch on which to rest her weary body . so [female] dropped down on to a heap of green turf .
so poor little [male] was left alone , while [male] was borne away full of trouble . not in the least knowing what to do , even the attention paid him by the princess . who was delighted with his beauty and pretty ways , did not console him . but there was no use in fighting against fate , and he could only wait and see what would turn up . the princess , [female] 's new [female] .
i confess that this attitude is beyond me . i have a fondness for all my people . and i would not have you misunderstand any of them . but with regard to one of them there is no need for me to say anything in her defence . about her at any rate we agree , i mean [female] .
no , that was too horrible to think about , he would rather that no human being should ever see him again . his unhappiness was simply frightful , no one in all the world was so unhappy as he . he was no longer a human being -- but a freak , little by little he began to comprehend what it meant . to be no longer human , he was separated from everything now ; he could no longer play with other boys . he could not take charge of the farm after his parents were gone .
every variety of belief finds place in this large collection . every charm or direction which could benefit the dead found a footing here if it attained popularity . from prehistoric days downward it formed a religious repertory without limits or regulation . portions known in the close of the old kingdom entirely vanish in later copies . while others appear which are obviously late in origin , the incessant adding of notes .
so the shepherd set out for home , and on his way through the wood he heard and understood all that was said by the birds . and by every living creature , when he got back to his sheep he found the flock grazing peacefully . and as he was very tired he laid himself down by them to rest a little . hardly had he done so when two ravens flew down and perched on a tree near by . and began to talk to each other in their own language : if that shepherd only knew that there is a vault full of gold and silver beneath where that lamb is lying .
see [male] , [male] 969 , and theophilus in icelandic . low german , and other tongues , by [male] , [location] , 1845 . there a complete account of the literature of the legend may be found . in almost all these early cases the fiend is outwitted by the help of the virgin or some other saint . and in this way the reader is reminded of the norse devil .
he now led them out to a rock in one of the fields . and ordered them to fall to work at blasting , hewing , and dragging stones . they toiled patiently , and made as if it were only sport to them . from morning till night their task master made them labour without ceasing . standing over them constantly , to prevent their resting , still their obstinacy was inflexible .
and the duckling went away , it swam on the water . and dived , but it was slighted by every creature because of its ugliness , now came the autumn . the leaves in the forest turned yellow and brown ; the wind caught them so that they danced about . and up in the air it was very cold , the clouds hung low . heavy with hail and snow flakes , and on the fence stood the [male] .
but , in the centre of the chief square of the town . was gathered a wild crowd of men in shining copper armour and helmets of gold and glittering dresses of feathers . among them ran about priests with hideous masks . crying them on to besiege and break down the royal palace , from the battlements of the palace the king 's guardsmen were firing arrows and throwing spears . the mob shot arrows back , some of them tipped with lighted straw .
conversation followed , which , after a while , began to prove very entertaining , among other subjects . it turned upon the events of the middle ages . which some persons maintained were more full of interest than our own times . counsellor knapp defended this opinion so warmly that the lady of the house immediately went over to his side . and both exclaimed against oersted 's essays on ancient and modern times .
in fact , [male] very soon saw bees flying in and out . and it was evident that these people had their honey made on the premises . they were chiefly selling country produce , they had cheeses so large as to reach to their waists . and the women trundled them along as boys do their hoops . they sold a great many kinds of seed .
so the possum and li ' l [male] went along together , the possum loping along by the side of the road and li ' l [male] going very slowly in the middle of the road . for his shoes were full of sand and it hurt his toes . they went on and on until they came , all at once , to a sort of open space in the woods and then they stopped .
they had a great affection , however , for their monarch . and for fifteen or sixteen years all the spinning wheels were silent throughout the land . the little princess [female] grew up without ever having seen one , but one day . the king and queen being absent at one of their country houses . she gave her governess the slip .
lo all ye englishmen , see ye not what a mischief here was . for [male] was the most king and knight of the world . and most loved the fellowship of noble knights , and by him they were all upholden . now might not these englishmen hold [location] content with him . lo , thus was the old custom and usage of this land .
`` listen , [male] , '' he said , and then he took me on his knee . i was a small chap then -- and told me things that made me forget old [female] . and wish and wish that mother could have stayed with us , the angels had wanted her , father explained . well , we wanted her too , and there were plenty of angels in heaven , anyway . when i said this father gave me a great squeeze and put me down .
then the cat thanked them for the [female] . and gave them a pocket handkerchief and a comb , and told them that when the witch pursued them . as she certainly would , all they had to do was to throw the handkerchief on the ground and run as fast as they could . as soon as the handkerchief touched the ground a deep , broad river would spring up . which would hinder the witch 's progress , if she managed to get across it .
i walked along at the foot of the cliff . and after some ten minutes descried above me the circle of white stones . the wall was perfectly upright , but its surface was rugged enough to give promise of a foothold . i turned my head , and at that instant saw . a short distance away , farther down the line of the cliff .
on [female] , each of the dutch children sets out in the chimney his wooden shoe . into it , he puts a whisp of hay . to feed the traveller 's horse , whennicholas first came to [male] . he arrived in a sailing ship from [location] and rode on a horse . now he arrives in a big steamer , made of steel .
standing above , and peering down , they could see nothing , because , with the melting of the snow . a thick mist had risen out of the valley , and swam white as milk beneath them . into which great dish of milk the cataract poured its foam . [male] took at last with him five of the nimblest and youngest of the moona mulgars . not knowing what difficulties or dangers might not beset them .
standing at the top of the extremely steep slope which is acorn street . [male] surveyed the prospect doubtfully , he saw a narrow cobble stoned roadway . on his left , a trim row of doll houses . each with its projecting doorstep and old-fashioned scraper , its spotless white door and shining brass knocker . and a narrow brick sidewalk where two thin people could just walk abreast .
the stranded goods belong to the bishop , and there is a store of goods here . the sea casts up tubs and barrels filled with costly wine for the convent cellar . and in the convent is already good store of beer and mead . there is plenty in the kitchen -- dead game and [person] . hams and sausages ; and fat fish swim in the ponds without .
all the other merchants stood still and tried to see how the sale would come off . and when they observed that the boy began to search in his pockets . they flung themselves over the counters . filled their hands full of gold and silver ornaments . and offered them to him , and they all showed him that what they asked in payment was just one little penny .
when the youth arrived at a spring , in the most secluded part of the forest . the nymph of the fountain was so struck by his beauty that she drew him down beneath the waters . and he was seen no more , [female] , one of the heroes . who happened to be also in the forest , heard his cry for help . and on meeting [male] informed him of the circumstance .
he had hardly uttered these words when he felt himself seized and secured . and his shirt was pulled out at the back , and to the tail of it was tied a petrol can . he turned his head , and then saw all the dogs gathered together which formerly he used to hurt . and who now were celebrating with great laughter the happy event of making [male] run with the can tied to his tail . two kicks well given rid him of all doubt and made him start running as fast as he could .
being born on the birthday of [person] , i seem to have something of my patron saint 's spirit of adventure . and running away was one of the delights of my childhood , many a social lunch have i shared with hospitable irish beggar children . as we ate our crusts , cold potatoes . and salt fish on voyages of discovery among the ash heaps of the waste land that then lay where the albany station now stands . many an impromptu picnic have i had on the dear old common , with strange boys .
they will eat fish , but two or three dogs soon get to know where the meat eating englishmen live . they come trotting in regularly with a business like air to search among the day 's refuse for bones . should any interloping dog try to establish a right to share the feast he can only gain his footing after a victorious battle . all these dogs are very wolfish looking , with straight hair , which is usually white or tan colored . there are other pet dogs kept in houses , these look something like spaniels .
the little man took the necklace , seated himself before the wheel . and whirr , whirr , whirr ! three times round and the bobbin was full . then he took up another , and whirr , whirr , whirr ! three times round , and that was full ; and so he went on till the morning . when all the straw had been spun , and all the bobbins were full of gold .
notwithstanding my anger , i could not forbear laughing at the fellow 's impertinence . i wish i had no business upon my hands , said i . if i had not , i would accept of the proposal you make me . i would go with all my heart to be merry with you , but i beg to be excused . i am too much engaged this day ; another day i shall be more at leisure .
nor did the man delay to come , but donning his armour . rode forth from the city gate . the two combatants met in full tilt in the open field . charging each the other with his spear full upon the shield , but the spear of the seneschal made no way . of so pure and well refined a metal was the prince 's shield .
now when the children leaned over the side , they saw that they were sailing slowly over their own forest . the tree tops were like a restless green sea just a little beneath them . they flew low enough to hear bird calls and the voices of the streams . it was then they suddenly noticed that the littlest of the forest children was there curled up fast asleep at tree mother 's feet . [male] cried to him in surprise .
`` what ? '' cried the farmer , and he opened the oven with all speed and saw all the nice things the woman had hidden . but which he believed the magician had conjured up for their special benefit . the farmer 's wife did not say a word . but set the food before them ; and they both made a hearty meal of the fish . the meat , and the cake , little [male] now trod again upon his sack and made the skin squeak .
under their united rule , however , the kingdom prospered greatly , the rajah was the spur of every noble work . and the wuzeer the curb to every rash or impracticable project . in a country some way from rajah [female] 's there lived a little queen . called [female] ranee , her father and mother reigned over the pomegranate country . and for her they had made a beautiful garden , in the middle of the garden was a lovely pomegranate tree .
that sea monster was no other than the enormous shark . which has often been mentioned in this story and which , on account of its cruelty . had been nicknamed `` the [male] of the sea '' by both fish and fishermen , poor [male] ! the sight of that monster frightened him almost to death ! he tried to swim away from him , to change his path .
from that time [female] had frequent conferences with her son the prince on the same subject . and omitted no opportunity or argument to endeavour rooting out his aversion to the fair sex . but he eluded all her reasonings by such as she could not well answer . and continued in the same mind , the prince answered with so little temper . or rather with so much heat , that the sultan , enraged to see himself affronted in full council .
these are genuine popular tales of the south of scotland . which the writer fell in with in largs , he heard them from a servant girl . a native of the place , they are quoted as illustrations of the vitality of the creed . they are not stories of the highlands . but are quite analogous , the student of such mythologies will recognize in them a semblance to the fairy tales of the north of [female] .
she led the princess to the place where the stream was deepest . and then , when the beauty stooped to look at herself in the water . [female] pushed her in , after that she stripped herself to her shift . and hid her clothes under a rock , and climbed up into the tree . there she sat among the leaves , peering out just as the princess had done .
the king and queen were sitting in the royal library . of which the shelves were full of the most delightful fairy books in all languages . all equally familiar to king [female] , the queen could not read most of them herself . but the king used to read them aloud to her , a good many years had passed . seventeen , in fact -- since queen [female] was married .
and this time she whisked off the wig . and there lay the lad , so lovely , and white and red , just as the princess had seen him in the morning sun . after that the lad slept every night in the princess ' bedroom . but it was not long before the king came to hear how the gardener 's lad slept every night in the princess ' bedroom . and he got so wroth he almost took the lad 's life .
when his money was spent , the jackal felt puzzled as to how to get a living . since no one would give him food and he could buy none . fortunately for him , just then one of the bullocks belonging to the village died . the jackal found it lying dead by the road side . and he began to eat it , and ate .
and now she lived as a herdswoman , guarded her herd . and was very sad and full of longing for her beloved one ; she had a little calf which she taught to know her . and fed it out of her own hand , and when she said . and when she had lived for a couple of years alone and full of grief . a report was spread over all the land that the king 's daughter was about to celebrate her marriage .
then , greatly wroth , she hasted and lifted the stone on high ; she flung it far from her . and leaped after it with loud ringing armour , the stone landed twenty and four paces off . but the maid sprang further , then [male] went swiftly where the stone lay . [male] lifted it , but it was the man they saw not that threw it . [male] was mighty , bold and big , he hurled the stone further .
one night there was not a breath of air . and i could not sleep , i tossed this way and that for hours . and directly the birds began to twitter , i put on my things and slipped back the bolt of the grand hall door . once outside , it was beautifully fresh and cool , and the clouds in the sky were like wreaths of pink flowers on a turquoise sea . arched over with gleaming gold , they changed every moment .
wind is nothing more than air moving across the surface of the earth . which as it passes along bends the tops of the trees . beats against the houses , pushes the ships along by their sails . turns the windmill , carries off the smoke from cities . whistles through the keyhole , and moans as it rushes down the valley .
but hardly had she spoken when an angry cry from afar fell on their ears . [female] had seen them -- seen her long , yellow hair floating on the breeze and gleaming like gold in the rays of the setting sun . he swerved and swooped downwards , and , madly as they rode for the edge of the forest . he was upon them by the time they reached the outskirts . alighting on the ground , he tore the princess from the prince 's arms .
scarcely had they got back to their own house when the purveyor entered his room . he had spent the evening at a wedding feast . and had a lantern in his hand , in the dim light it cast he was astonished to see a man standing in his chimney . but being naturally courageous he seized a stick and made straight for the supposed thief , `` ah ! '' he cried , so it is you .
in our fairy cabinet , which can not extend to sixty volumes , we have aimed at pleasing children . not `` grown-ups , '' at whom the old french writers directed their romances , but have hunted for fairy tales in all quarters . not in [location] alone , in this volume we open . thanks to dr. [male] , with a story from the turks . `` little king [male] '' is an original invention by m. [male] .
now [female] was in the sunny summer palace of [male] . which [male] , son of art . had built for a pleasure house on the brink of the slow flowing boyne . near the fairy brugh of [male] the ever young . the god of youth and beauty .
indeed they all seemed quite contented and happy ; for the storm howled without , and they were warm and snug within . by the side of a blazing turf fire . `` i was just thinking , '' said [male] . taking the dudeen from his mouth and giving it a rap on his thumb nail to shake out the ashes -- i was just thinking how thankful we ought to be to have a snug bit of a cabin this pelting night over our heads .
people said that she was being brought up and educated in a religious house . where she was learning every royal virtue . at last she came , then the little mermaid , who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful . was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty . her skin was delicately fair , and beneath her long dark eye lashes her laughing blue eyes shone with truth and purity .
she took the prince 's hand and led him into her palace . where the walls were the colour of the brightest tulips in the sunlight . the ceiling was one great shining flower , and the longer one gazed into it the deeper the calyx seemed to be . the prince went to the window , and looking through one of the panes saw the tree of knowledge . with the serpent , and [male] and [male] standing by .
the astonishment of the giant at the sudden disappearance of the prince may well be imagined . he ordered all the passages to be watched , but it was too late . for the prince had already glided between two rocks , he wandered for a long while through the forests . where he met nothing but fearful monsters . he climbed rock after rock .
miss [female] lived under a gooseberry [female] just outside the farm house door . and the spider lived in the barn opposite . and there was a fine tuft of grass in between , where they sometimes met . the farm people knew all about fairies . and on midsummer [female] always put out a bowl of curds and whey for miss [female] in the true old-fashioned style .
there was once upon a time a man named [male] . who was very poor , he had no clothes but rags . and nothing to eat but the food that was given him in charity . one day when he was searching about in the dust heap for stray grains of [male] . he found a small piece of money .
[male] locket , said the rag doll . and then little [male] rabbit began to laugh , for he had once read of a little [female] locket who had lost her pocket . and he remembered that she lived not far away , so he steered the bunnymobile while the old gentleman bunny talked to the rag doll . and by and by , not so very long , they came to a pretty house . and right there on the front porch sat a little girl crying .
`` aha , your majesty always has such a pleasant way with you , '' said old [male] politely ; and young [male] decided that when he grew up he would try not to have any pleasant ways at all . the king rustled quickly round the little house , and looked at everything—dresser . chairs , plates and pots . he was sorry that there was nothing that he could find fault with .
so saying he took the hand of the shadow witch . and together they left the garden of shadows . and set out for the land of fire , behind them trooped the shadows . eager to behold for themselves that beauteous fairyland which was henceforth to be their home . but black shadow was not among them , as soon as prince [male] had ceased to speak .
how enchanted they both were , [male] cooked the nice things . and they dressed themselves in the finery . and sat down to a very good dinner , but , alas , the woodman drank so much of the wine that he soon got quite tipsy . and began to dance and sing , [male] was very much shocked ; but when he proposed to dig up some more of the gold . and go to market for some more wine and some more blue velvet waistcoats .
down went the bowl , `` oh , dear , '' cried [male] , `` murder ! murder ! '' bellowed the cook ; and away ran the king 's nice furmenty into the kennel . the cook was a cross fellow and swore to the king that [male] had done it out of some evil design . so he was tried for high treason and sentenced to be beheaded , when the judge delivered this dreadful sentence it happened that a miller was standing by with his mouth wide open . so [male] took a good spring and jumped down his throat .
and she was angry , very angry , and that did her good . for otherwise she would have been deeply grieved ; now she could fall asleep and sleep the invigorating sleep of youth . [female] left bex , and took the homeward path up the mountains . in the fresh , cooling air , the domain of the ice maiden , the thick foliage of the trees deep below him looked as if they were potato plants . the firs and the bushes appeared even less , the alpine roses bloomed near the snow .
itinerant street sellers have , on stalls of a height suited to their little customers . an array of what looks like pickles , this is made of bright seaweed pods that the children buy to make a `` clup ! '' sort of noise with between their lips . so that they go about apparently hiccoughing all day long , the smooth glossy leaves of the camellia . as common as hedge roses are in england .
`` thank you , '' said little [female] . and then she went to the other flowers , and looked into their little cups . and asked , `` do you know where little [female] is ? '' but each flower . as it stood in the [female] , dreamed only of its own little fairy tale of history . not one knew anything of [female] , [female] heard many stories from the flowers .
the prince , kissing his father 's hand . overwhelmed him with his gratitude and joy . a courtier , [male] by name . young and gallant , was despatched with eighty equipages , a hundred mounted squires , and the portrait of the prince warrior . to ask the princess [female] in marriage .
but her moaning went on , at last the prince resolved to go to the hut and get something to carry her on . but before he went he tied her up with little ribbons . and they were tied in such a manner that the princess could not undo them . as she was trying to free herself she saw [female] coming towards her . and made a sign to her to hasten ; and , strange to say , [female] reached her exactly at the same moment as the prince with [female] .
if it were known that the young man who wanted a wife had visited a girl in the other tribe . his spear and bow and arrows were taken away from him till the moon was full . the other boys and the girls treated him roughly and called him hard names . but he dare not defend himself and had to suffer patiently , this was all because of the feud between the two tribes . this went on until the maidens in the valley , who were very many , while yet lovely and attractive .
as [person] had immediately guessed , this was a troop of that mysterious race of gypsies that comes from no one knows whither . and wanders over the world with no destination in view . everywhere they are dreaded by the quiet inhabitants of the villages . for they are ready to steal all that comes their way , and never respect what belongs to another . at the slightest provocation their knives are ready to spring from their belts .
`` ca not i ? '' said the urchin , `` you watch , '' another fling , and horrors ! the shore lark rolled over , twittering helplessly and miserably , [female] was across the rocks like a young goat . and when the urchin , contrite but defiant . arrived , she had the wounded bird in her hands and was holding it to her breast . feeling gently for its hurt , it lay quite still , panting , and watching her with quick bright eyes .
since writing this , and while considering whether or not i would print it , as a warning to the young nolans and vallandighams and tatnalls of today of what it is to throw away a country . i have received from [female] , who is on board the levant . a letter which gives an account of [male] 's last hours . it removes all my doubts about telling this story . i try to find heart and life to tell you that it is all over with dear old [male] .
tristan looked at [female] to see how she bore the shock of hearing such people mentioned as carpenters and shoemakers . but she was smiling as if [female] 's words pleased her . the three princes stayed on at the castle , and the court was very gay . only king [male] 's heart was heavy . for he knew that he must lose his most beautiful daughter .
the eagles were about to turn and fly , when all at once they perceived their sister . they came round her . and caressed her hands lovingly with their beaks , she at once began to sprinkle them with her tears from the lachrymatory . and in one moment the twelve eagles were changed back into the twelve princes . and joyfully embraced their sister , the princess then fed them all round from her ever growing loaf .
the written humor of the dutch does not usually make a very strong appeal to us . they are inclined to be ponderous even in their play , and lack in great measure the sarcasm and satire and the lighter subtlety in fun making . history records a controversy between [female] and zealand . which was argued pro and con during a period of years with great earnestness . the subject for debate that so fascinated the dutchmen was .
`` this will do , '' said [male] , who , because he weighed the most . was the greatest fool of the three , so the wise men all sat within the bowl . with their feet together , and the people pushed them out into the water . the tide caught the bowl and floated it out to sea . and before long the wise men were beyond sight of land .
there was not , as far as the eye could see , a single whole pane of glass in any one of the many windows of the mansion . and there were not wanting those in the community who were willing to prophesy that in a stiff gale . such as used to be prevalent in that section of the world , and within the recollection of some of the old settlers too . the chimneys , once the pride of the county . would totter and fall , bringing the whole mansion down into chaos and ruin .
in proof of this story the old irish records maintain that an extraordinary storm arose that night and blew away a whole sand mountain . few tourists ever explore the beauties of the little [person] peninsula . save holiday makers from the neighbouring town of swansea . yet it is a country of amazing charm . with a glorious coast and high ridges of heather and moorland .
it now only remains for me to express my hearty thanks to [male] . [location] , of fynone , for his kindness in placing at my service a very old view of swansea . a faithful transcript of which has been made by the artist for the present volume . i make this public acknowledgment to our townsman for the reason that he is always ready to aid all efforts having in view the publication and circulation of works relating to dear old cambria . it was a bright and glorious august morning .
wondering whether i had ever seen that necklace before , i passed behind the old man . and as i did so the [male] fixed its eye on me and ruffled its feathers in agitation . i had no sooner gone by than there was a great fluttering among all the storks . and i observed , coming toward me down the street . a bent old woman , stooping under a bulging bag and holding out what appeared to be a [female] with a [female] at the end .
there was once a shoemaker who , through no fault of his own , had become so poor that at last he had only leather enough left for one pair of shoes . at evening he cut out the shoes which he intended to begin upon the next morning . and since he had a good conscience , he lay down quietly . said his prayers , and fell asleep , in the morning when he had prayed . as usual , and was preparing to sit down to work , he found the pair of shoes standing finished on his table .
`` the beautiful is past , '' said the carriage , and the same sigh passed through the whole of nature . and from the human heart it sounded : the beautiful is past ! with the delightful green forest , with the warm [female] , and the song of birds , past , past ! so it said , and so it creaked in the trunks of the tall trees . and there was heard a sigh , so inwardly deep , a sigh direct from the heart of the wild rose bush .
then there came into the room a child -- the queen 's little son . tears stood in his eyes , and glistened on his cheeks . he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet . with silver clasps , `` mother , '' cried the little boy . `` only hear what i have read , '' and the child seated himself by the bedside .
as soon , therefore , as he was gone , she sat down to dress . and was attired by her women to the best advantage in the richest habit of her wardrobe . her girdle was of the finest and largest diamonds set in gold . her necklace of pearls , six on a side . so well proportioned to that in the middle , which was the largest ever seen .
the trappings of her palfrey were of finest embroidery . her bridle was a chain of gold . from the palfrey 's mane hung little silver bells . nine and fifty little silver bells , it was the fairy music of the bells that had reached the ears of [male] as he lay dreaming on the bank of the little brook . the lady 's skirt was green , green as the leaves of spring .
now all that night it had rained heavily , and did not seem likely to stop . and in some places the road was so thick with mud that it was almost impossible to get across it . in one spot it was so very bad that a mule laden with baggage had got stuck in it . and tug as he might , his master was quite unable to pull him out . the muleteer in despair appealed to the two horsemen .
all about her seemed wrapped in grey vapours ; the soft draperies with which her body was covered were also grey . like finely woven cobwebs , at each side of her couch . close to her head , stood large jars of tarnished silver . filled with irises the colour of autumn clouds . at her feet , rigid and unblinking , as if cast out of steel or carved in [male] .
so when it was morning the raja 's son set out . and in two days he reached the second gosain and told him of his [male] . the gosain listened to his story and put the cooking pot on to boil and in it threw two grains of rice . and this , when cooked , was sufficient for a good meal , after they had eaten . the gosain said that he could not tell how the animals were to be found .
the young man leaped from his couch , girded on his harness . and strode out , three young men met him , each in battle harness . and these four advanced to meet four other men who awaited them at a little distance on the lawn . then these two sets of four fought togethor with every warlike courtesy but with every warlike severity . and at the end of that combat there was but one man standing .
and with that he prepared food for the journey . a string of deer 's flesh for her to carry . and one for himself ; and so they started , now the camp of the tribe was distant six days journey , and when they were yet one day 's journey off it began to snow . and they felt weary and longed for rest , therefore they made a fire .
at midnight there was a wondrous scene in the ancient forest of burzee . where for the first time in many centuries the rulers of the immortals who inhabit the earth were gathered together . there was the queen of the water sprites . whose beautiful form was as clear as crystal but continually dripped water on the bank of moss where she sat . and beside her was the king of the sleep fays .
she was met by a beautiful lady . and a small group of story people . who led her to the castle of the king and queen of story island . they took her into the court , where the rulers sat in state . this made [female] happy , for she knew the cat would love that .
pinocchio , being made of wood , floated easily and he swam like a fish . at one moment they saw him disappear under the water . carried down by the fury of the waves , and next he reappeared struggling with a leg or an arm . at last they lost sight of him and he was seen no more . [male] , hoping to be in time to help his father .
soon she began to grow weary of having nothing to do . then she remembered that the old woman , as she called her . had told her to keep the house tidy , but in truth she would have been glad of the employment . only just because she had been told to do it , she was unwilling . for there are people—however unlikely it may seem—who object to doing a thing for no other reason than that it is required of them .
and the child did as she was bid without fear , and lo ! the beautiful little golden head was off in a second , by one blow of the axe . but first , because she was a wicked witch woman , knowing spells and charms . she took out the heart of the little girl and made it into two savoury pasties . one for her husband 's breakfast and one for the little boy 's .
but back to the dreary world of the macdermots , first , be warned that their story . which does not start very well , does not end well , either , as a visitor to the ruins of their country house might suspect . [male] , reigning patriarch , is on the verge of losing his house . his property and his mind , his daughter [female] is seduced by the english revenue agent . [male] 's son [male] .
the idea of the christmas tree pleased [male] . and so the following year he carried many of them in his sledge and set them up in the homes of poor people who seldom saw trees . and placed candles and toys on the branches . of course he could not carry enough trees in one load of all who wanted them . but in some homes the fathers were able to get trees and have them all ready for [male] when he arrived .
`` if no one offers more , i will give that sum , '' replied [male] , looking at the merchants at the same time with a countenance that forbad them to advance the price . he was so universally dreaded , that no one durst speak a word . even to complain of his encroaching upon their privilege , [male] went back to the chamber . and having privately acquainted the fair persian with their design , that she might not be surprised .
but the villagers threatened the witch woman that if her nephew or any of his family got ill again they would kill her . and they told her that as her secret had been found out she was henceforth to be their ojha and cure their diseases . and they would supply her with whatever she wanted for the purpose . they asked what [female] her nephew must make on his recovery . and she told them to get a red cock .
among those who so often gathered to hear the [female] sick girl tell her pretty stories was a youth of [female] 's age . older than the others , a youth with sturdy frame and a face full of candor and earnestness . his name was [male] , and he was a student in the city . he hoped to become a great scholar sometime , and he toiled very zealously to that end . the [female] , the gentleness , the sweet simplicity .
so when they danced to the [male] of [male] clout . and the others would have [male] lead the ring . the knight took [male] and set him in his place . and when [male] took the garland of flowers from her head and set it on [male] 's . he again put it on the head of [female] .
i must have touched some answering chord , looking back , i can not believe that this was wholly grandma bard . could it be that the others had wanted to dig it up . independent of my suggestion ? for there was not one dissenting voice , the occasion seemed to warrant the best dishes . i brought out six [location] plates and six spoons . these would be used for serving my own family , while the others took the two cans and ran home with them to their families .
but her heart was filled with joy and pride because of her brother 's deeds . now , when [male] 's wounds had healed and his strength had returned . the people of the mountain escorted him in triumph to the royal city . and there , amid universal joy , the brave prince claimed and received his own . the annals of fairyland tell of no better king .
one day , when his mourning was over , he gave orders that everything should be made ready for a grand hunt . the queen pretended to be greatly delighted that he was going to amuse himself once more . and declared that she would accompany him , no , mother , i can not let you come , ', he answered . `` the ground is rough , and you are not strong , '' but he might as well have spoken to the winds . when the horn was sounded at daybreak the queen was there with the rest .
he began again at once , while he sang , nanny and [male] sat a little way off . one hemming a pocket handkerchief , and the other reading a story to her , but they never heeded diamond . this is as near what he sang as i can recollect , or reproduce rather . what would you see if i took you up to my little nest in the air ? you would see the sky like a clear blue cup turned upside downwards there .
morning was at hand ; only the brighter stars were left in the wide and cloudless sky . presently the dawn broke over the green horizon of the trees . arriving at the bound of the forest , the man of the wildwood lifted his arm once more in token of farewell . and with his animals clustered about him , watched his friends till they vanished down the road . presently the domes and towers of the city of glass rose before the little company .
there was such happy splashing and dipping , but no bird had ever the [male] soft drying . or was wrapped in such a warm night gown as the mother found for [female] . it was one of [female] 's night gowns . but quite large enough , then she tucked him into a narrow couch far from the fire . it was the first time [female] could ever remember having slept alone .
while they were both in pleasant mood , wending their way homewards . and the uncle whistling the tune of a song he had learnt in his young days . they suddenly heard a peculiar sound which seemed to come from the top of the mountain . they looked up , and saw above them , on the over hanging rock . the snow covering heave and lift itself as a piece of linen stretched on the ground to dry raises itself when the wind creeps under it .
still [female] hesitated ; but [female] came and laid her white hand on his arm . and looked up into his scowling face pleadingly , to save me , [female] , ', she begged . and [male] said he would go , then there was great sport among the asir . while they dressed [female] like a beautiful [female] . [female] and her sisters , the nine valkyrie .
the king governed himself by her advice . and would even sometimes hold a council in her apartment , the news of this change in the princess spread everywhere . the young princes of the neighboring kingdoms strove all they could to gain her favor . and almost all of them asked her in marriage . but she found not one of them had sense enough for her .
as soon as the dragon king 's retainers had put down the presents they vanished . and [male] told all that had happened to him , the presents which he had received from the grateful dragon king were found to be of magic power . the bell only was ordinary , and as [male] had no use for it he presented it to the temple near by . where it was hung up , to boom out the hour of day over the surrounding neighborhood . the single bag of rice , however much was taken from it day after day for the meals of the knight and his whole family .
now [female] was a wise boy . and he knew that the robbers would come back in the dead of the night to get their gold . and so when it came time to go to bed he put the cat in the rocking chair . and he put the dog under the table . and he put the goat upstairs .
`` come , '' he said to her , `` let america flee ! '' she objected that it was useless to flee , since they would be at once overtaken . but he constrained her to go with him . but very soon [male] overtook them , and cried out to the prince . `` wait , just wait , i will never forgive you this ! ''
of course they do not print books `` out there , '' for the printer 's ink under water would not so much run as fly . she made that very plain ; but in one way or another nearly the whole of terrestrial literature . says [female] , has come to them , we know , ', she said . they form indeed a distinct reading public .
he gave the keys into [male] 's unwilling hand . and ordered silence proclaimed , `` hearken , good friends ! '' said he , and all talk and going to and fro ceased , the tenantry stood down in the court yard . a mass of motionless russet and yellow . every face watching the baron , the gentry swarmed noiselessly out upon the steps behind him .
it crawled upon the table , and wherever it went it left traces of burns . curved like the tracks of a rainworm , gradually it wound itself about the scholar 's book and the book . too , grew black , then it occurred to him that it might be a dragon . so he carried it out of doors on the book . there he stood for quite some time ; but it sat uncurled .
`` do not cry , my darling , '' said [female] ; but the merrow . like any bold child , only cried the more for that , `` what 's your name , my darling ? '' says [female] , thinking to make her conversant with him . but he got no answer ; and he was certain sure now . either that she could not speak , or did not understand him : he therefore squeezed her hand in his .
and then at last came a day ( and a sad day it was for [female] ) . when she again met the little man who had come for her on the great black horse . she had gone to market to buy the stuff for a new apron and was walking along . thinking of nothing but her purchase , when suddenly she saw the little man slipping about among the market people . never touching them and unseen by any , he was peeping into the butter firkins .
the rich squires and great knights drew to the minster . meet is it that the old help the young . even as they in their day were holpen , the time sped in merriment and sports . first , god to honour , they sang mass . then the people pressed in hard to behold the youths dubbed knights with such pomp and high observance as we see not the like of nowadays .
but if you will strike them with this [male] . which i throw down to you , they will not touch me . and the good prince , never thinking that the old woman was a witch . struck his servants with the [male] , who , without him noticing it . turned into stone , seeing this , the old woman came down from the tree .
ashipattle had one sister , and she was very good and kind to him . in return for her kindness he told her long stories of trolls and giants and heroes and brave deeds . and as long as he would tell she would sit and listen , but his brothers could not stand his stories . and used to throw clods at him to make him be quiet . they were angry because [male] was always the hero of his own stories .
the princes [female] and [female] . and the princess [male] , who knew no other father than the intendant of the emperor 's gardens . regretted and bewailed him as such , and paid all the honours in his funeral obsequies which love and filial gratitude required of them . satisfied with the plentiful fortune he had left them . they lived together in perfect union , free from the ambition of distinguishing themselves at court .
agree that the monster is more [male] , and has more reason to complain , than we . therefore , since we have found what we sought for , let [location] return to our dominions . and let not this hinder [location] to marry again , for my part . i know a method by which i think i shall keep inviolable the faith that any woman shall plight to me . i shall say no more of it at present , but you will hear of it in a little time .
both of the boys were well formed and healthy , but the second born lacked the grey curl which heretofore had never failed to mark each new born greylock . [female] , the major domo , who was a direct descendant of [male] . the squire , and who knew the history of the ducal family better than any one else . for he had learned it from his grandfather . was so dejected that one would have imagined a great misfortune had befallen him , and in the evenings .
and so , with the addition of yet another pair to their numbers . they quickened their pace along the road . they were becoming hungrier every minute -- even the sons and daughters of the old woman who lived in a shoe . who , as we have seen , had had far too light a supper -- and while they were willing to sleep without shelter . if they were called upon to do so , they all hoped that they need not go to sleep supperless .
she had just time to finish the message . fold it , and drop it from the casement window . when one of the women of the palace came to her , it was time to begin her daily tasks and lessons . but the faithful blue bird was still keeping watch , and the bit of white paper had no sooner touched the ground than he flew to it . seized it in his beak , and bore it safely to [male] .
but no one interfered with them in any way . although both prince marvel and [male] knew that every eye followed them as they rode forward . curiously enough , they had both forgotten from what direction they had approached the castle . for , whereas they had at that time noticed but one marble roadway leading to the entrance . they now saw that there were several of these , each one connecting with a path through the mountains .
he stepped in at an open window , and there he found himself in a beautiful room . hung with cloth of silver and blue . and with chairs and tables of white and gold . dozens and scores of waxlights shone like so many stars . and lit every crack and cranny as bright as day .
on arriving there , they were received at the entrance by all his retinue . attired in splendid dresses , and blue beard , after saluting his bride . led the way to an elegant entertainment , where , every thing that could add to to their comfort being prepared . they spent the evening in the most agreeable manner . the next day , and every succeeding day .
up , up , my lieges and away , we take the field again . for ladies fair we fight today and king ! up , up , my merry men , this time the pokes left sullenly . but the effect of their presence had thrown [male] . the cowardly lion , and the knight into a violent fit of the gapes .
but the youth stepped forward and encouraged them and called out , `` we must not let our country be ruined ! '' then others followed him , and he pressed on and defeated the enemy . when the king heard that he had to thank him alone for the victory . he raised him higher than anyone else in rank . gave him great treasures and made him the first in the kingdom .
the old king was so terrified that he nearly fell into a swoon . for he had only this one child , they therefore consulted together . and decided to send , not the princess , but a miller 's daughter . who was very beautiful ; and leading her out , they gave her a knife . and told her how she was to scrape the iron stove .
again the merry notes went sounding far and wide , the cattle on the mountain heard them . and those that were old enough remembered how these notes had called them from their pastures every evening . and so they started down the mountain side , the others following . the merry notes were heard in the village below . and the people were much astonished thereby , why , who can be blowing the pipes of old pipes ? ', they said .
it fell out once , as the queen was bathing , that a frog crept out of the water on to the land . and said to her : `` your wish shall be fulfilled ; before a year has passed you shall bring a daughter into the world . '' the frog 's words came true , the queen had a little girl who was so beautiful that the king could not contain himself for joy . and prepared a great feast , he invited not only his relations . friends , and acquaintances , but the fairies .
to celebrate her visit , they danced upon the tight-rope . and bounded about with a skill and an agility beyond example . beauty was much pleased with the monkeys , but she was disappointed at not finding anything which could enlighten her respecting the handsome unknown . losing all hope of doing so , and looking upon her dream as altogether an illusion . she did her best to drive the recollection of it from her mind .
after her sisters had made known to her everything they had to tell . [female] invited them to see the palace . and , calling to the voices , ordered them to prepare baths with sweet smelling spices . and to set forth a banquet for her guests , at these tokens of riches and splendour . envy began to arise in their hearts , and curiosity also .
while [male] was thus occupied , [male] unlocked the cupboard where he had hidden his precious crutches . but , alas , the wood of the apple tree was not suitable for such use . and the crutches fell to pieces when he touched them . [female] tried to mend them here and join them there . but it was in vain , they broke again in other places .
the horse plunged and reared and then set off at a hard [organization] , which it continued in spite of its rider 's efforts to stop it . when they reached the village , the hazel nut child left off pricking the horse . and the poor tired creature pursued its way at a snail 's pace . the hazel nut child took advantage of this , and crept down the horse 's leg . then he ran to his aunt and asked her for a comb .
the dragon was now so near that in a couple of springs he would be over the frontier . the youth now began to consider how he should act , for if he had to push the iron horse from behind he could not ride upon it as the sorcerer had said he must . but a [male] unexpectedly gave him this advice . ride upon the horse , and push the spear against the ground . as if you were pushing off a boat from the land .
day by day she became dearer to the prince . he loved her as one loves a good sweet child . but it never entered his head to make her his queen . yet unless she became his wife she would never win an everlasting soul . but on his wedding morning would turn to sea foam , `` am i not dearer to you than any of them ? ''
two maids came in , one of them had a cap on her head of two colors . they poured out the wine , bowed their heads , and withdrew . just then it came into his mind that he would stoop under the table . and so creep to the door , he tried it . but before he reached the entry , the rest discovered what he was about .
the grand vizier went with the news to [female] . who received it with as much joy as if it had been the most agreeable thing in the world . she thanked her father for having obliged her in so sensible a manner . and , perceiving that he was overwhelmed with grief , she told him . in order to his consolation , that she hoped he would never repent his having married her to the sultan .
when [female] heard this he sat upon the walls of the town . and began to play upon his harp , and this time its music was so loud and clear . that it could be heard far and wide , and its sound was so exultant and joyous . that when the soldiers heard it they raised their heads . and their fears vanished , and they started forward , shouting and calling that they would conquer or be killed .
the old man asked them for food and a place to rest . they would not listen but went on to the settlement , slowly the old man followed them . down the trail to the wigwam village , in front of each wigwam . he saw a skin placed on a pole . this he knew was the sign of the clan to which the dwellers in that wigwam belonged .
she had more than once been seen -- it was always at night . beside some well , sitting on the brink of it . and leaning over and stirring it with her forefinger . which was six times as long as any of the rest , and whoever for months after drank of that well was sure to be ill. to this . one of them , however , added that he remembered his mother saying that whoever in bad health drank of the well was sure to get better .
riding forth together , [male] led the king deeper and deeper into a wild and desolate country where he had never been before . and where there were no pathways , [male] looked to and fro over the waste . but saw no sign of man or beast . and no bird flitted or piped , great gaunt stones stood upright on the hillsides . solitary or in long lines as if they marched , or else they leaned together as if conspiring .
well he remembered the exact spot where he had planted the willow slip on the edge of the pond . but , when he arrived there , he could see no sign of it . in its place was a gigantic trunk bearing vast branches which towered overhead . and there the birds were singing the same songs as they sang . three days ago , alas , could it indeed be three centuries ago ?
now , the landlord had three daughters , and no sooner did they see the goose than they wanted to know what curious kind of bird it might be . for never before had they seen a fowl of any kind with feathers of pure gold . the eldest made up her mind to wait for a good opportunity and then pluck a feather for herself . so as soon as [female] went out of the room she put out her hand and seized the wing of the goose . but what was her horror to find that she could not unclasp her fingers again .
`` when i come into very great danger i must break one of these , '' she said to herself . then she went home , and set out quite willingly with the king 's messengers . when these arrived at the palace with the beautiful young [female] everyone pitied her fate . but she herself was of good courage . and asked the queen for another bridal chamber than the one the [female] had had before .
the prince promised , and kept his word a while . but he had been brought up by a foolish nurse , who indulged him in every way and was always telling him that he would be a king one day . when he might do as he liked in all things . he found out now that even a king can not always do that ; it vexed him and made him angry . his ring began to prick him so often that his little finger was continually bleeding .
ferko , who never doubted that the mouse would be as good as its word . lay down comforted on the soft grass and slept soundly till next morning , the day passed slowly . and with the evening came the little mouse and said , now there is not a single stalk of corn left in any field . they are all collected in one big heap on the hill out there . then [male] went joyfully to the king and told him that all he demanded had been done .
the gander said never a word , he was doubtless too busy propelling his great wings and steering with his tail to pay much attention to what his two passengers were saying . i do not know whether there was a sign up like the ones they have in the cars . `` do not talk to the motorman , '' or not , at any rate . the gander observed the law , for he made no answer . on and on they went , through the night , past cloud and star .
it is a custom among [location] santals that husband and wife do not mention each other 's names . and even if a husband sometimes mentions his wife 's name in a case of urgent necessity . the wife will never speak her husband 's ; in the same way a man may not mention the name of his younger brother 's wife or of his wife 's elder sister . women again may not use the name of their younger sister 's husband or their husband 's elder brother . our forefathers have said that if any one breaks this rule his children will be born deaf or dumb .
but still he could hear false singing and bad sounds . gossip and idle words , scandal and slander . groaning and moaning without and within , heaven help us , he thrust his fingers deeper and deeper into his ears . but at last the drums burst , now he could hear nothing at all of the good . the true , and the beautiful , for his hearing was to have been the bridge by which he crossed .
and the queen waved her wand again , and wind shook the trees above them . and the most luscious fruit that was ever tasted fell down into their hands ; and when the feast was over there was dancing in the glades to the music of the harps . and when they were tired dancing they set out for the boats . and the moon was rising above the trees as they sailed away over the lake . and it was not long until they reached the bank below the fairy palace .
the poor wife aided her husband to lie down , but when he would have spoken to her again . his voice was gone -- a moment more , and he was dead . to this plan the queen made no objection . and , bidding an affectionate farewell to her humble friends . she took her place with the boy in a travelling carriage sent to fetch them .
however , they all set out for the hunt , and fixed their meeting place at a certain pool . the newly married prince went to his tigers , and told his tigers and hounds to kill and bring in a great number of gazelles and hog deer and markhor . instantly they killed and brought in a great number , then taking with him these spoils of the chase . the prince came to the pool settled on as a meeting place . the other princes , sons in law of the king of that city .
so now that he knew his troublesome guest had taken his leave . the woodman soon moved back all his goods , and his wife and children into their snug old house . and there they lived happily , for the elf never came to see them any more . and the woodman every day after dinner drank . `` long life to the king of norway , ''
when the fair one with golden locks heard of this , she reproached her husband for his ingratitude . and then throwing herself at his knees , implored that [female] might be set free . but the king only said : `` she loves him ! '' and refused her prayer , the queen entreated no more , but fell into a deep melancholy . [female] heard the news , and , gliding in and out among the crowd which clustered round the young and lovely widow .
of all the villagers , as i have said , [male] alone professed to have any recent acquaintance with the little folk . and the wonder was how they , who were known to be sworn enemies to idleness . could keep him in their favor , one night the harvest moon was riding her glorious way across the heavens . and the little village of hayfield lay steeped in silver light . not a lamp or a [female] glimmered in the hamlet .
now when the people in the town and palace heard music coming from the tower they were filled with amazement . and came to the king with the news that witchcraft must be going on in [male] 's tower . for , instead of dying of starvation , he was seemingly making merry to the sound of music . and to the clatter of plates , and glass . and knives and forks ; and the music was so enchantingly sweet that all the passers-by stood still to listen to it .
twice a week the farmer went regularly into the room and asked his little black captive if he would answer him now . but the little one still obstinately persisted in his silence , the farmer had now . without success , pursued this course for six weeks . at the end of which time his prisoner at last gave up . one day as the farmer was opening the room door .
this is what the lady was doing while they were away , she boiled pitch . and filled a barrel , and that boiling , now she went beside it . she rubbed the healing water to herself . she came out ; she went to the barrel . she gave a jump in and out of the barrel .
both king and queen expressed a hope at parting that she would soon learn the lesson . that it was all due to them alone that she had fared so well hitherto . as [female] could not travel very far owing to weakness , she took shelter in the first small hut she could find . and there stayed , trying to alleviate his sufferings , now , near this hut was a mound of earth in which dwelt a snake . in the evenings , as is usual in [location] , the snake came out of his hole and stood on the mound of earth .
out in the country it was hard winter . and the glass was a few degrees lower than in the town . the sharp winds swept across the snow-covered fields , the farmer . muffled in warm mittens , sat in his sledge , and beat his arms across his breast to warm himself . and the whip lay across his knees , the horses ran till they smoked again .
we have tried to disentangle the diverse types of belief . by seeing what is incompatible between them , but in practice we find every form of mixture of these views in most ages . in the { 18 } prehistoric times the preservation of the bones . but not of the flesh , was constant ; and food offerings show that at least the theory of the soul wandering in the cemetery was familiar . probably the [female] theory is also of the later prehistoric times .
everything in this part of fairyland was lovely . but it was always cloudy , no sun , star or moon was ever seen . yet the little men did not seem to mind it and enjoyed themselves every day . there was no end of play , and that suited [male] . yet by and by , he got tired even of games and play .
once more it opened its eyes -- then closed them again . and its throbbing ceased , [male] gave a sob . its last look reminded him of the princess . he did not know why , he remembered how hard he had laboured to set her beyond danger . and yet what dangers she had had to encounter for his sake : they had been saviours to each other .
to [female] , the sun god , and [female] . a beautiful ocean nymph , there was born in the pleasant land of [female] a child to whom was given the name of [female] . the bright and shining one , the rays of the sun seemed to live in the curls of the fearless little lad . and when at noon other children would seek the cool shade of the cypress groves . [male] would hold his head aloft and gaze fearlessly up at the brazen sky from whence fierce heat beat down upon his golden head .
soon afterwards , whilst [female] still remained at glennaquoich . there was a great hunting of the stag , to which [male] went with three hundred of his clan to meet some of the greatest highland chiefs , his neighbours . he took [male] with him . and the numbers present amounted almost to those of a [male] army . while the clansmen drove in the deer , the chiefs sat on the heather in little groups and talked in low tones .
why , i am not naturally positive , every one knows that , i would not set my own opinion against the opinion of mrs. [female] . unless i were quite sure , on any account whatever , nothing should induce me . but this is a question of fact , and the fact is . that the kettle began it , at least five minutes before the cricket gave any sign of being in existence . contradict me : and i will say ten , let me narrate exactly how it happened .
after this the girl lived all alone in the little cottage , she worked hard . spinning , weaving , and sewing , and her old godmother 's blessing seemed to prosper all she did . the flax seemed to spread and increase ; and when she wove a carpet or a piece of linen . or made a shirt , she was sure to find a customer who paid her well . so that not only did she feel no want herself .
caleb and his daughter were at work together in their usual working room . which served them for their ordinary living room as well . and a strange place it was , there were houses in it . finished and unfinished , for dolls of all stations in life . suburban tenements for dolls of moderate means .
the sun was shining gloriously , so [male] and the old lady went along the footpath through the corn . where it was rather dusty , at the church door stood an old crippled soldier leaning on a crutch . he had a wonderfully long beard , more red than white , and he bowed down to the ground and asked the old lady whether he might wipe her shoes . then [female] put out her little foot too , dear me . what pretty dancing shoes , said the soldier , sit fast , when you dance ,
it was broad daylight , and close by where she had been sleeping lay a nettle like the one she had seen in her dream . she fell on her knees and offered her thanks to god . then she went forth from the cave to begin her work with her delicate hands . she groped in among the ugly nettles , which burned great blisters on her hands and arms . but she determined to bear it gladly if she could only release her dear brothers .
but she found that climbing was a far easier matter than descending from her place of refuge . for she now observed that the tree sent out , on nearly all sides of its gnarled trunk . the remains of huge jagged and lifeless branches . to avoid which would require a skill which she did not possess . she had no choice , however , but to make an attempt to get down .
two nights after this , other men , armed with knives and muskets . came into our tent , they were albanians . brave men , my mother told me . they only stayed a short time , my sister [female] sat on the knee of one of them . and when they were gone , she had not three , but two silver coins in her hair .
`` very well , '' said the rajah , and he picked up a parrot which lay dead on the ground . and placing within his own body the beauty preserving charm , transported his soul into the parrot . and flew off , on , on , on he went , over the hills and far away . until he came to the garden , then he flew over the seven hedges of bayonets . and with his beak broke off the three pomegranates ( in which were [female] ranee and her two ladies ) .
any one else would have dressed their hair ill to spite them for their rudeness . but [female] was good natured , and only took more pains to make them look well . the two sisters scarcely ate a morsel for two days before the ball . they wished to look thin and graceful , they lost their tempers over and over . and they spent most of the time before their tall glasses .
at first the king would believe nothing of it . but the old woman talked so long , and suggested so many bad things , that he at last let himself be persuaded . and condemned the queen to death , now a great fire was kindled in the courtyard . and she was to be burned in it ; and the king stood above at the window . and watched it all with weeping eyes , for he had held her very dear .
he immediately saddled his horse , what need to remain here longer ? hastily snatching a few ripe nuts that lay among the shattered branches . he concealed them in his doublet as a remembrance . and then rode away through the gloomy forest , far and wide , [male] wandered over the green earth beneath the blue heavens . encountering many enemies , but in spite of all he kept courageously on his way . `` happiness at last , '' he exclaimed , `` the blue eyes ! ''
another time [male] and a party of lawyers were riding from one town to another to attend court . each lawyer wore his best clothes , [male] was most careful of his well worn suit . on the road the party passed a small pig that had fallen into a ditch . the poor little creature cried in a most pitiful fashion , at a bend of the road [male] drew rein . his friends rode on , but he returned .
the clerk of the ship took an account of all the bales . with the names of the merchants to whom they belonged . and when he asked the captain in whose name he should enter those he had given me the charge of . `` enter them , '' said the captain , `` in the name of [male] . '' i could not hear myself named without some emotion .
and she did save his life , for just as captain smith was to be killed . the child threw her arms about his neck . and begged her father to spare the white man 's life . for her sake , [male] loved his little daughter . and wished to please her in everything , so he promised to set the prisoner free .
they took the cart and the sledge to the tavern . and stayed there drinking until the tavern keeper said they had had all that the cart and the sledge were worth . then the tavern keeper took them and threw them out of doors into the night . and they picked themselves up and crawled home . next day [male] complained worse than before , and begged the peasant to come with him to the tavern .
so when the great square was filled with people come to see the race . insomuch that the men swarmed like ants , and the windows and roofs were all as full as an egg . lightning came out and took his stand at the top of the square waiting for the signal . and lo , forth came ciennetella . dressed in a little gown tucked half-way up to her knees , and a neat and pretty little shoe with a single sole .
the fairy condoled with his majesty , and approved of all he had done . then , being a fairy of great common sense and foresight . she suggested that the princess , awakening after a hundred years in this ancient castle . might be a good deal embarrassed , especially with a young prince by her side . to find herself alone , accordingly , without asking any one 's leave , she touched with her magic wand the entire population of the palace .
she was interrupted by prince , who ran eagerly to the door and began sniffing at the latch in great excitement . then he gave a long , low howl , at the same moment the latch rattled . and the viauds distinctly heard a little voice cry . `` open , open , good people , '' the old couple looked at each other . the cheeks of one flushed , and the other 's paled , at the same moment they rose stiffly from their chairs by the fire .
`` farewell , dear good little girl , '' said the swallow . and flew off into the [male] , [male] gazed after him with the tears standing in her eyes . for she was very fond of the swallow . `` tweet , tweet , '' sang the bird . and flew into the green wood , [female] was very unhappy , she was not allowed to go out into the warm [female] .
it matters nothing if one is born in a duck yard . if one has only lain in a swan 's egg , it felt quite glad at all the need and misfortune it had suffered . now it realized its happiness in all the [female] that surrounded it . and the great swans swam round it . and stroked it with their beaks , into the garden came little children .
`` where is it ? '' asked the queen , and she stretched out her hands . `` it is here , '' said [male] , very slowly he drew it out from under his cloak . and then suddenly he threw it over her , and now take it ! ', he cried . it was in vain that the queen struggled and cried . the more she strove , the closer the chain drew about her .
the next day they went into the churchyard . and took the two cake figures with them . and sat down under the church wall , which was covered with luxuriant ivy in summer and winter . and looked as if hung with rich tapestry , they stuck up the two gingerbread figures in the [male] among the green leaves . and then told the story , and all about the silent love which came to nothing .
the list of persons present at a funeral should be written on slips of paper . and firmly bound together , it may be written as any other list , only it must not be written beginning at the right hand . as is usually the case , but from the left hand ( as is the case in european books ) . on the day of burial , during the funeral service , incense is burned in the temple before the tablet on which is inscribed the name under which the dead person enters salvation . the incense burners , having washed their hands , one by one , enter the room where the tablet is exposed .
but she spoke not a single word , the king talked to her . and inquired of her her name ; but she was silent , not uttering a word . nor returning him an answer , ceasing not to hang down her head toward the ground . and what protected her from the anger of the king was her beauty . and her tenderness of manner , so the king said within himself .
but the first ball was not the last , and [female] could not stand it . it was a good thing , therefore , that summer brought with it rest . and exercise in the open air , the family had been invited by the old count to visit him at him castle . that was a castle with a garden which was worth seeing , part of this garden was laid out quite in the style of the old days . with stiff green hedges ; you walked as if between green walls with peep holes in them .
when the princess got out of her crystal bed in the morning she went to her cabinet . opened one of the velvet lined cupboards , and took the head it contained from its golden shelf . then , by the aid of the mirror inside the open door . she put on the head -- as neat and straight as could be . and afterward called her maids to robe her for the day .
then he led the wondering fairy from his prison . to a group of tall , drooping ferns . beneath whose shade a large white [male] had been placed . forming a little tent , within which , on a couch of thick green moss . lay [male] in a deep sleep ; the sunlight stole softly in .
so they stayed where they were and the lightning came and slew them both . pregnant women are not allowed to go about alone outside the village ; for there are bongas everywhere and some of them dislike the sight of pregnant women and kill them or cause the child to be born wry necked . a pregnant woman may not make a mud fireplace for if she does her child will be born with a hare lip . nor may she chop vegetables during an eclipse or the same result will follow . she may not ride in a cart , for if she does the child will be always crying and will snore in its sleep .
meanwhile the king grew old and very sad , so that , one day , the courtiers persuaded him to go a hunting to cheer him up . night overtook him . and , seeing a light in a palace , he sent a servant to know if he could be entertained there . and he was answered that everything was at his disposal . so the king went to the palace and passing into a great guest chamber he saw no living soul .
the ranee at once sent for workmen and bade them go out to the rat holes and dig and fill them in . and the children and the rats would certainly have been smothered just as the nurse had planned . only luckily the old mother rat was hiding near by and overheard what was said . she at once hastened home and told her friends what was going to happen . and they all made their escape before the workmen arrived .
then they went into the garden , into the great avenue where the leaves were dropping . softly one by one ; and when the palace lights went out , one after the other . the crow led little [female] to the back door . which was ajar , they had now reached the stairs , where a little lamp was burning on a shelf . there stood the tame sweetheart , twisting and turning her head to look at [female] .
well , he waited till the morning , and quite early the old woman appeared and took out a little pipe and blew in it . and in a moment all the crows in the world were flying about her . not one was missing , then she asked if they knew anything about the three bulrushes . but not one of them did , the prince went on his way . and a little further on he found another hut in which lived an old man .
when [female] understood what she said he felt so sorrowful . he wondered why she had told him . and he longed to stay in that great place with queen [female] . his own little [male] , whom he had carried in his pocket . and taken care of , and loved , he walked up and down , up and down .
printed in large type -- easy to read , for children from six to eight years . a new series of exciting adventures by the author of the little [male] rabbit books . this series is unique in that it deals with unusual and exciting adventures on land and sea and in the air . this is a good rainy day story . on just such a day mr. [male] invites marjorie to go for a trip in [female] 's ark .
[male] is a proud young man , and miss [female] is a proud young woman . [female] pen and ink drawing opposite page 110 in the folio society edition of 1993 tells it all . with the walled city of [male] represented in the background . [male] sits on the barren ground looking away . unhappily , to his right , miss [male] , parasol over her head to protect her from the sun .
thus it was with the parents as the years passed sadly by . but all the while the seasons went and came again ; the [female] gladdened the earth . the rainbow beautified the shower ; the flowers blossomed in the garden . and young hearts beat happily as theirs upon their bridal day . on that bright morning of the fete of corpus christi .
the beauty and goodness of the fair [male] were so praised by sir [male] that [organization] said he would wed her . and prayed sir [male] to take his way into [male] for him . as his messenger , to bring her to cornwall , all this was done to the intent to slay sir [male] . notwithstanding , sir [male] would not refuse the message for any danger or peril . and made ready to go in the goodliest wise that might be devised , he took with him the goodliest knights that he might find in the court .
yes , said the king 's daughter , indeed i will be careful . and not touch the least thing , just as you have told me . but when they entered the forest , it was so thick that it was almost impossible to win through . she was as careful as she could be , and avoided the branches . and thrust them aside with her hands ; but the branches struck her in the face each moment .
the story is told by gelin and is very popular in poitou . the heroine is a girl by day and a white hind by night . the pack of hounds belonging to her brother [female] chase her in the forest . she complains of this to her mother who begs [female] to call back the pack . but it is too late , the white hind is captured and killed , her palpitating flesh is stripped from the carcase and prepared as a dish of venison .
in a few days the peasant put the cat into a large sack and walked far into a leafy forest . then he opened the sack and let the cat bound away . how many interesting things there were in the depths of the beautiful wood ! after wandering about for a few hours the cat began to feel quite at home . especially when he found a little deserted cabin where he took up his abode and dined bountifully on mice and birds .
for not a breeze stiffed , and the sailors sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging . there was music and song on board . and , as darkness came on , a hundred colored lanterns were lighted , as if the flags of all nations waved in the air . the little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows . and now and then , as the waves lifted her up , she could look in through clear glass window panes .
his grateful master then wished to present him with a pair of raftsmen 's boots . but [male] put them aside , and brought forth another pair . such as had never before been made , my grandfather used to declare that they must have weighed a hundred pounds . and were five feet in length , the raft continued its journey down the rhine with [male] in command . so that it soon arrived at [male] , there they received about four times the price usually obtained .
it sang of the happy days when it could merrily fly about . of fresh green corn in the fields , and of the time when it could soar almost up to the clouds . the poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage . the little [female] would have liked so much to help it , but what could be done ? indeed , that was very difficult for such a small flower to find out , it entirely forgot how beautiful everything around it was .
when [female] saw that [female] still managed to look as white as snow . instead of being burnt as brown as a [female] , she wondered what could have happened . and began to watch her closely , the following day , when the sun was at its highest and hottest . she noticed her draw a fan from the folds of her dress and hold it before her eyes . the fairy , in a rage , tried to snatch it from her .
well , he was some little time about the hand shaking . and before it was over he had her fixed snug behind him . and while you could count three , he , and she . and the filly were through all the guards , and a hundred perches away . on they went , and next morning they were in the wood near the king of spain 's palace .
[female] now ran rapidly towards the house ; every time she turned she saw the mouse galloping after her . and laughing with a mocking air , arrived at the house , she tried to crush the mouse in the door . but it remained open in spite of every effort she could make and the mouse remained quietly upon the door sill . `` wait awhile , wicked monster ! '' cried [female] , beside herself with rage and terror .
but dawn showed once more a piteous sight , again there were only trampled and blood stained rushes . with the loathsome smell of unclean flesh . again the foul tracks of the monster were found where it had padded softly back to its noisome fens . there were many brave men in the kingdom of [male] the dane . and yet again did they strive to maintain the dignity of the great hall .
full of hope , i proceeded the next day to the justice hall . several letters lay upon the table ; the old senator asked whether they were of my writing . i looked at them , and found that they were by the same hand as both the letters that i had received . this i disclosed to the senator ; but he seemed to give but little weight to it . answering that i must have written both , for the name subscribed was unquestionably a z .
so did her voice cease . and on the earth fell sudden darkness , for to [female] had come the shame of love rejected . and there were those who said that to the earth that night there came no sunset . only the sullen darkness that told of the flight of an angry god . yet , later , the silver moonbeams of [male] seemed to greet the dark earth with a smile .
when the whole story of [male] 's perils and adventures by land and sea was told . the king marvelled greatly at the power of love that had drawn two sundered hearts together in so wonderful a fashion . the lady [female] , with her husband . prince [male] , dwelt in the land of [location] in a state of the utmost delight and happiness for many . many days , beloved of the king and all the people .
br'er fox he look sort of dubious . but he start toward the creature , old cousin wildcat walk all round the tree rubbing hisself . but he ai not saying nothing , br'er fox he went up a little nigher . cousin wildcat stop rubbing on the tree . and sat upon his behind legs with his front paws in the air .
having said so much , i will now try to give some account of the famous yoshiwara of [location] . to which frequent allusion will have to be made in the course of these tales . at the end of the sixteenth century the courtesans of [location] lived in three special places . these were the street called koji machi , in which dwelt the women who came from kioto . the kamakura street , and a spot opposite the great bridge .
then it occurred to me to pin a note to royal 's saddle blanket and to send royal back to camp telling the boys of the trouble i was in . the horse understood it all ; off he galloped . conscious of the import of the mission upon which he had been dispatched , [male] ! went the guns over yonder , as if the revengeful creatures in the far-off brush guessed the meaning of our manoeuvering and sought to slay my loyal friend . but not a bullet touched him -- leastwise he galloped on and on till i lost sight of him .
we have seen that when [male] assumed his god like form . he took his place among the immortals . but he had not long enjoyed the rapturous delights of olympus . before he felt within him an ardent desire to fulfil his great mission of interpreting to mankind the will of his mighty father . he accordingly descended to earth , and travelled through many countries , seeking a fitting site upon which to establish an oracle .
tall was he , broad shouldered and very strong , yet so lithe and swift moving withal that none in his wide land of the blue hills could master him in a trial of strength or speed . his favorite pastime was country wrestling . and on holiday morns you were sure to see him and his good foster father wandering down the village lanes to the day 's wrestling match . each tricked out in his best , each with a fine blue kerchief knotted at the throat . and when [male] , after a stirring battle of catch and turn and tug and strain would hold his rival 's shoulders to the straw and then leap up .
`` are you ready to pay the price ? '' said he . nodding gayly to the dwarf , as he asked the question . the listening water steeds snorted more furiously than ever , `` are you ready to pay the price ? '' said the little man a second time , a shower of spray . tossed on shore by the angry steeds , drenched the dwarf to the skin .
one grand white carbuncle , as big as an arc lamp . hung from the roof , filling the grotto with dazzling white light . and the [female] of the carbuncle was flung back in a million points of new [female] from the walls of the grotto . shifting and shimmering like the rainbow across a waterfall , [female] and orange . yellow and [female] , [female] and violet .
they divided up all the wild creatures , and put their new king next to the jackals . so that when they cried out at nights , he cried too . and nobody found out that he was only a jackal . but one day some young jackals made him angry . so he turned them out and ordered the wolves and foxes to remain nearest to him .
the prince and [male] , well provided with cash for their expenses . continued their journey both by land and sea . and found no other obstacle but the length of the way which they were forced to undergo . at length , however , they arrived at the capital of [location] . where [male] , instead of going to his lodging carried the prince to a public inn .
exercised a surprisingly beneficial effect on the whole financial condition of [location] . had altered the state of the exports and imports for the current half year . had prevented the drain of gold , had made all that matter right about the glut of the raw material . and had restored all sorts of balances with which the superseded noblemen and gentlemen had played the deuce—and all this . with wheat at so much a quarter , gold at so much an ounce .
thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway . the gate was opened , and as the girl passed through , a shower of gold fell upon her . and the gold clung to her , so that she was covered with it from head to foot . `` that is a reward for your industry , '' said mother [female] . and as she spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well .
she had thus disguised herself to follow him . and now vowed that unless he took her to be his wife . she would die by her own fair hand , there was no time for discussion . for , at that moment , arose a mighty tempest which threatened to engulf the ship . in vain were the efforts of the sailors to manage the vessel .
his sister and the maidens bore witness to the truth of his story . and when the king heard all this he banished the two elder brothers from his presence . married the youngest to the [male] of his choice , and decreed that he should be heir to the throne after his own decease . many years ago there lived in a hermitage a holy monk . from all the villages around , the people , mostly poor labourers .
and the princess , pale and sad . worn out by long waiting , promised to look no more for [female] horn , to please her father and his people . she even promised to marry [female] horn 's old playfellow , prince [male] . ah , but had they only known , king horn was already hastening towards the palace . already he had learned that the wedding had not yet taken place .
the parents being dead and gone , the children home he takes . and brings them straight unto his house where much of them he makes . he had not kept these pretty babes a twelvemonth and a day . but , for their wealth , he did devise to make them both away . he bargained with two ruffians strong , which were of furious mood .
it is said that when the kind rode out on horseback he often took [male] with him . and if a shower came on he used to creep into his majesty 's waistcoat pocket . where he slept till the rain was over , king [male] one day asked [male] about his parents . wishing to know if they were as small as he was , and whether rich or poor . [male] told the king that his father and mother were as tall as any of the persons about the court .
[female] with anxiety , the earth fairy opened the case . and ran her fingers over the wands to test their power . the green wand shot forth [female] fire from its tip as she took it from among the rest . it was as full of magic as on that far-off day when with it she had so cruelly enchanted the baby princess . with covetous eyes flying soot looked upon it , `` ah ! ''
the mother recognized this as a home thrust , and wisely kept silent . she wet her finger tips . twirled the thread , stopped the wheel , inspected some point in its mechanism with a scowl of intense preoccupation . and then spun on again with a severe concentration of interest as if lovers were of small consequence compared to spinning wheels . mother [female] was a tall , stately woman of fifty .
strangely monotonous are all the witch trials of which [location] has so many to show . at first the accused denies , then under torture she confesses . then relapses and denies ; tortured again she confesses again , amplifies her story , and accuses others . when given to the stake , she not seldom asserts all her confessions to be false . which is ascribed to the power which the fiend still has over her , then she is burnt and her ashes given to the winds .
the damsels fled , and [female] turned again to the window . the gates were now opened , and her father and [female] . followed by a great retinue , rode into the courtyard , ah ! what perfect [female] of form and feature ! asenath's heart almost burst for frantic beating as she looked at him .
from that time forth the carpenter 's wife drank free of expense every sunday . for the others had to admit that she had fooled her husband the best . there once lived a king and a queen who ruled over a very great kingdom . they had large revenues , and lived happily with each other ; but , as the years went past . the king 's heart became heavy , because the queen had no children .
and in the twinkling of an eye it was done . only just in time too , for the goblins were close at hand . and looked round eagerly for the stream and the fish . but neither stream nor fish was to be seen ; nothing but a rose [male] . so they went sorrowing home , and when they were out of sight the rose [male] and rose returned to their proper shapes and walked all the faster for the little rest they had had .
daily she became more beautiful -- fair she was , and white , her little hands . for all she used them for work in the house and work in the fields . were as white as [female] flowers ; the hot sun could not burn her neck . or her pale and delicate cheek , in the fulness of time she bore seven children . all as fair as she , and they grew up tall and strong with straight noble limbs .
the old man lived happily in his declining years , as the father in law of a king . and with his sweet daughter , who had once been so miserable , a queen . this is certainly a `` nature story , '' the princess and her attendants are clearly personification of the elemental forces . the classical scholar can not fail to be struck by the likeness of her metamorphoses to the story of [female] and [female] . indeed the `` protean myth '' so repeatedly occurs in these primitive slavonic stories that it is impossible not to suspect a common origin .
by this time night had fallen , and [female] was very tired . thankfully she found herself at the gate of a convent . and asked if she might stay there till morning , but the portress answered roughly that it was no place for beggars . and bade her begone , so the poor girl dragged herself slowly along the road . till a light and the bark of a dog told her that she was near a farm .
what power has been at work arranging their delicate forms ? in the fourth lecture we shall see that up in the clouds another of our invisible fairies . which , for want of a better name , we call the `` force of crystallization , '' has caught hold of the tiny particles of water before `` cohesion '' had made them into round drops . and there silently but rapidly , has moulded them into those delicate crystal starts know as `` snowflakes '' .
[female] sent for his horse and armour . and took his leave of king [male] . who was almost wroth that he should depart upon a [male] that promised but misfortune . he would have him stay with him in his court . but [male] would not , and so departed , for many days , by lonely ways and through forest drives .
`` i must leave you , '' as a tall young man . whose face was like the sun in its brightness . entered , and taking her by the hand he led her to the door . she made no resistance , but turning as she left the lodge . she cast upon [female] a smile of kind regard .
the whole thing , said the public persecutor , was nothing but a plot . the prophecy of [male] , which nobody had seen . till [male] found it ; the blue mountain . which nobody but [male] had seen at all ; the thick milk so mysteriously obtained . all pointed to dark treason and villainy , the crack in the mug was a peculiarly incriminating circumstance .
ride a cock horse to banbury cross , to see an old lady upon a white horse . rings on her fingers , and bells on her toes . she shall have music wherever she goes . [male] , he was a piper 's son . he learned to play when he was young , and all the tune that he could play was .
she turned sick at herself , and would gladly have been put out of existence . but for three days the odious companionship went on , by the third day . [female] was not merely sick but ashamed of the life she had hitherto led . was despicable in her own eyes , and astonished that she had never seen the truth concerning herself before . the next morning she woke in the arms of the wise woman .
[female] drew a deep breath , yes , you and [male] and i . in a boat , he pointed to a white sail far out stuck up like a feather slantwise in the water . `` well , let 's swim across now , '' [male] shouted , and ran into the waves . falling flat as soon as he was deep enough and swimming fast away , the other children followed him . ready for a [male] , you or i would have found that water very cold .
for rushing upon the black , he wounded him on the knee . the monster , feeling himself wounded , uttered such a dreadful yell as made all the plain resound . he grew furious and foamed with rage , and raising himself on his stirrups . made at [male] with his dreadful cimeter , the blow was so violent . that it would have put an end to the young prince .
the pot , now he was in it . seemed bigger than the biggest dome in the world ; to run all round it took him two or three minutes . away in the centre of its base stood a great opal knob . like the axle to a wheel round which he and the green feet kept circling . however much he wished and wished , the green feet still kept their distance .
[female] , on hearing this , contrived to escape , and hid himself ; but [male] was taken before the magistrate . fined for breaking the peace , and , having drunk out his last penny the evening before . was thrown into prison till he should pay , when [male] heard this . he was much delighted , and determined to set out immediately for the golden river . how to get the holy water was the question , he went to the priest .
but [male] , king of the forest goblins . had seen and heard everything , like a wraith of mist he had slipped from tree to tree and kept himself hidden from the brothers among the branches of an old beech tree . [male] had always hated old [male] , he hated him as a mean scoundrel hates an upright man . and above all things he hated him because the old man had brought the sacred fire to the glade so that it might never go out . and the smoke of that fire made [male] most horribly .
when the morning morrowed , the king went forth and sitting down on the throne of the kingship . summoned the grandees of his empire ; whereupon the chamberlains and deputies and captains of the host went in to him and kissed the earth before him . he distinguished the vizier with his especial favour and bestowed on him a dress of honour and entreated him with the utmost kindness . after which he set forth briefly to his chief officers that which had betided him with [male] and how he had turned from that his former usance and repented him of what he had done aforetime and purposed to take the vizier 's daughter [female] to wife and let draw up the contract of marriage with her . when king [male] heard his brother 's words .
now the nurse , knowing that none could approach the princess but herself . without leave of the eunuch who commanded the guard at the gate . addressed herself to him , who , she believed . was ignorant of what had formerly passed at [organization] , you know . said she , i have brought up and suckled the princess , and may likewise have heard that i had a daughter whom i brought up along with her .
the broad country around the ants town was almost deserted . [male] saw only his garrison in the square . the guards hiding in the blossoms of hawkweed and grass stems . groups of workmen putting various things in order . and the nurses in perturbation , running all over the town and taking care of the entrances where they had placed the chrysalises .
but the bird flew on from tree to tree , and from valley to valley . never so fast that [male] could not keep pace with it . but never coming within his reach , or letting go of the talisman . so the flight went on and so the chase continued , till several hours had passed and it began to grow dark . then the bird , uttering once more its strange cry , went up to the topmost branch of a high tree and settled itself to roost .
when the king 's daughter came to the church . the pastor and all the congregation were still standing before the church door . waiting for her , the prince came running up at once , and wanted to hold her horse . but she jumped down and said : no , thanks , it is not necessary . for my horse is so tame that he will remain standing when i tell him to do so .
`` a grave , dig me a grave ! '' still sounded in her ears ; she was fearful that the cock might crow . and the first red streak appear in the east , before she had finished her work . and then she would be lost , and the cock crowed , and the day dawned in the east . and the grave was only half dug , an icy hand passed over her head and face .
the ladies club of glasgow is enterprising and its exhibitions are interesting . but mrs. [female] is not a member of any club . and sends her pictures by invitation to exhibitions on the continent as well as in [location] . and sometimes has a private exhibition in glasgow , her study at [organization] and [female] 's gave a certain daintiness and [female] to her work . which is more parisian than british in style , there is great freedom in her brush and a delicacy well suited to the painting of children 's portraits .
one day , he went out hunting in the green forest . while waiting for a wild boar to rush out , there rode past him a young woman whose beauty was dazzling . he instantly fell in love with her . the next day , while on horseback , at the same opening in the forest . the same [female] reappeared ; but it was only for a moment .
`` just that one , '' said the young girl and pouring wine into the cup . put it to his lips and he drank . then the joy of life streamed in his blood . the whole world seemed to belong to him , why torment one 's self ? every thing is made for our enjoyment and happiness !
and the king gave him a brooch lovelier than any on the palace walls . the king and the prince , followed by the cats . went down to the strand , and when the prince stepped into the boat all the cats `` mewed '' three times for good luck . and the prince waved his hat three times . and the little boat sped over the waters all through the night as brightly and as swiftly as a shooting star .
after the [male] had heard [male] with much astonishment . he desired his grand vizier to request [male] to acquaint him wherefore her breast was disfigured with so many scars . commander of the faithful , to avoid repeating what your majesty has already heard in my sister 's story . i shall only add , that after my mother had taken a house for herself to live in . during her widowhood , she gave me in marriage .
it was early dawn when we sailed home across the lake . i lay in the bottom of the boat . with my head upon my mother 's lap . not asleep , i believe -- but listening to the water rippling against the boat . and faintly recalling the beautiful figures i had been seeing all day , i knew them all so well .
in this sad condition , i was ready to die with grief . i cried out in agony , beat my head and breast . and threw myself upon the ground , where i lay some time in despair . i upbraided myself a hundred times for not being content with the produce of my first voyage . that might have sufficed me all my life , but all this was in vain .
this was the hardest task of all , for she had been willing to be good . not because it was right , but because she wished to be beautiful , three times she sought the grotto . and three times she left in tears . for the golden specks on the wings of the purple fairies grew dim as she approached . and the golden wands were still crossed to shut her from the immortal fountain .
in 1604 he seems to have appeared in [location] , [male] says . under this date , `` i fear lest i be accused of giving ear to old wives '' fables , if i insert in these pages what is reported all over [location] of the jew . coeval with the savior [male] ; however , nothing is more common . and our popular histories have not scrupled to assert it , following the lead of those who wrote our annals .
it may surprise the young reader that princes like [female] and [female] . whose feet were ever in the stirrup , and whose lances were always in rest . should have descended from the family of the hypnotida , who were remarkably lazy and peaceful . but these heroes doubtless inherited the spirit of their great ancestress . whose story is necessary to be known , on leaving his native realm during the crusades .
the fine gentleman came riding home in the evening . and he rejoiced when he saw his dear [male] well again . with plump pink cheeks . and a smile on her rosy lips , but the little lamb knew everything . he was sad and melancholy , and would not eat , and went every morning and every evening to the river .
four weeks after [male] 's death . and after he had shed many hot and heart-felt tears , [male] turned for the first time to his work again . in his best holiday costume of black velvet puffed with silk he entered the laboratory . holding himself very erect , the high , arched room was only dimly lighted by a hanging lamp . but when [male] heard his steps she shrank together till .
the apartments he had prepared for her were furnished in [location] style . and her birdlike little figure in oriental dress seemed rather out of place at first . it was not long , however , before she brought forth from the great box . which she had brought over seas , screens and fans . vases , panels , chinese matting .
the prince 's favorite plaything was a ball which was like no other ball that had ever been made . it was woven of magic stuff as bright as the sunlight . as sparkling as the starlight , and as golden as the moon at harvest time . and when the little prince threw it into the air . or bounced it on the floor or turned it in his hands it rang like a chime of silver bells .
so when he entered the village he did not go to the fine inn as his brothers had done . instead he turned in at the poor , mean looking inn , and there he spent the night quietly . and the next day he arose , and went on his way . just outside the village he came across the fox sitting in a field and waiting for him . the prince was so happy to think he was soon to find the golden bird that he scarcely listened to anything else the fox told him .
the curtains grew dingy , the floor dusty . and the ceiling looked as if it might have been made of a rain cloud . but the child played on , and got out all her treasures to show to her visitor . the pansies drooped and faded , the white dove hid its head beneath its wing and moaned . and the last [male] on the precious string grew dark when the goblin touched it with his smutty fingers .
`` i have received a better offer , and have determined to accept it . '' it must be known that [male] came quickly to a decision . and then persevered in it ; none knew the vanity of striving to change him . when fairly resolved , better than [male] ; but in small matters he was yielding as [female] herself . she stood in a fearful silence , looking into his face .
the days seemed all too short , and the guests were surprised when the time for their departure arrived . the feasting and dancing and sight-seeing were at last ended in the valley of enchantment . one glorious morning they rose with the sun . and bidding good-bye to princess [female] and her people . started to meet the black dwarf of the mountains , the same guide would accompany them to the place where they were to meet him .
so i came to [male] 's island , i lived by the sea shore and the women of the island attended me . how different was this earthly land from the kingdom under wave , with [location] there was but the one mild season . the one mild light , here there was glaring day and terrible darkness . bitter winds and hot beams of the sun . with [location] there were songs and tales .
the princess snatched the doll from her hands and threw it on the floor . if you will not let me play with a boy who is deaf . how can you expect me to play with a doll ? ', she asked . and although , no doubt , there was much in what she said , it was hardly the way in which to speak to the head nurse . indeed , there would have been a serious disturbance in the royal nursery the very next minute .
when [male] reached the palace of [male] . greatly was he troubled lest evil had befallen the children of [male] . but the attendants , because of their great fear of [male] . dared not to tell the king of the magic spell she had wrought by the way . therefore [female] asked , wherefore , o [female] .
finally , one day , when she was walking through a great , great wood . she felt tired , and sat down on a mossy tuft and fell asleep , then she dreamt that she went deeper and deeper into the wood . till she came to a little wooden hut , and there she found her brothers . just then she awoke , and straight before her she saw a worn path in the green moss . this path went deeper into the wood , so she followed it .
it was a terrible price that [female] would ask for a draught from the well of wisdom . and very troubled was [male] all father when it was revealed to him . his right eye , for all time to be without the sight of his right eye ! almost he would have turned back to [male] , giving up his [male] for wisdom . he went on , turning neither to [male] nor to [male] 's well .
in fine , [male] and his governor having fared well , returned thanks to the pastry cook for their good entertainment . and moved homewards , it being then late , when they arrived at the tents of [male] ad deen [male] . [male] 's grandmother received him with transports of joy . her son ran always in her mind , and in embracing [male] . the remembrance of him drew tears from her eyes .
and now [female] was worse off than before , for to her other miseries was added the fear of what would befall her when it was discovered that the persons of whom they were in [female] . and whom she was certain they must find , were her own father and mother . by this time the king and queen were so tired of seeing lost children . genuine or pretended—for they cared for no child any longer than there seemed a chance of its turning out their child—that with this new hope . which , however poor and vague at first , soon began to grow upon such imaginations as they had .
it got darker and darker . till at last [female] could only just see the hole . and it seemed to be a very long way off , every time he looked at it . it was farther off , and at last he saw a thin crescent moon shining through it . `` i am sure it can not be night yet , '' he said .
things went on like this for some weeks , when , one day . as the king 's son was riding through the forest . he heard some strange birds singing more sweetly than birds had ever sung before . he tied his horse to a tree . and followed where the sound led him , and , to his surprise .
and the little boy looked at the teapot ; the lid rose up gradually . the elder tree blossoms sprang forth one by one , fresh and white ; long boughs came forth . even out of the spout they grew up in all directions . and formed a bush -- nay , a large elder tree . which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtains aside .
unwilling to return empty-handed , and hoping for better luck on the morrow , the king gave the order to camp in the wood . some of the men were catching rabbits for supper . whilst others were making fires to cook them . when just as the last rim of the sinking sun disappeared below the horizon . a beautiful [male] as white as snow with antlers and hoofs of gold .
as she spoke the prince saw four or five pearls and as many diamonds fall from her mouth . he begged her to tell him how this came about . and she told him the whole story . the king 's son fell in love with her . and reflecting that such a gift as had been bestowed upon her was worth more than any dowry which another [male] might bring him .
but in the midst of her enjoyment , [female] remembered the fairy 's command . and at half past ten glided out of the room , and drove home again . her sisters found her waiting to undress them in her usual rags . and kept her up to tell her how beautiful the unknown princess was , and how well she was dressed . again the prince was vexed at the sudden disappearance of the beautiful stranger .
in the early part of february there was a second robbery , this time the stage was overhauled at lone pine . a ranch five miles beyond the camp . the details of this affair were similar to those of the previous business in the glen . a masked man sprang from the roadside . presented two revolvers at [male] head .
the badger , the fox , and the cub now sat down to dinner . and had a fine feast , the badger taking care to get the best bits for himself . `` now it 's your turn to die. '' so the fox pretended to be dead . and the badger changed himself into a hunter . shouldered the fox , and went off to the town , where he made a good bargain .
birds were twittering out of doors , and there was a soft lapping of water on the shore . the green boughs of a [male] tree almost brushed against the window panes . he was no longer in his old garret room , but in a pretty apartment . with bunches of rosebuds on the walls . and scent bottles on the toilet table , and muslin curtains .
the prince wasted no time , he set his horse at the wall and leaped over it . then he looked about for the three bulrushes , pulled them up and set off with them on his way home . as he rode along one of the bulrushes happened to knock against something . it split open and , only think , out sprang a lovely girl , who said . my heart 's love , you are mine and i am yours .
there was once a cobbler who worked hard at his trade , and yet never seemed to get on in the world . one evening he took his last piece of leather and cut out a pair of shoes and laid the pieces neatly on his bench . expecting to finish them in the morning , the next morning he went to his shop early to begin work . what was his surprise to find that in the night the pieces had been made up into a fine pair of shoes . he took them up and examined them .
she had never heard tell of him . but she ruled all the fish in the sea . perhaps some of them might know something about him . so she played them all home with a pipe she had . and asked them , but there was not one of them who knew anything about farmer [male] .
perhaps you can guess what it is without my needing to write it down . i was lucky to get a lift , we had risen before the moon took to her bed . and the sun had left his , we were driving through green woodlands when the light grew clear around us . a little while ago their graceful trees had been ruddy or bronze doubtless . now it was the turn of the hill trees on the great kopje that we passed within a mile .
prince [male] went not out of the tailor 's house for a whole month . without his host accompanying him ; at last , however , he ventured to go to the baths . returning home through a street in which there was nobody but himself and a lady . he was surprised at her approaching him unveiled , the lady . seeing a handsome young man just come out of the bath , asked him .
hinzelmann was fond of society . but the society he chiefly delighted in was that of females . and he was to them very friendly and affable , there were two young ladies at hudemühlen . named [male] and [male] , to whom he was particularly attached . he used to make his complaint to them whenever he was angry at anything .
so i am obliged to call her motion swimming , because i do not know of a better word . in less than a quarter of an hour they passed close under the bows of a splendid three decker . a seventy gun ship , the gannets who live in those parts had taken possession of her . and she was so covered with nests that you could not have walked one step on her deck without treading on them . the father birds were aloft in the rigging .
a deep blush suffused the face of the shrinking [female] . who had not as yet even looked upon the other 's countenance , and she trembled more than ever . but with a [female] which no one had expected from the quarter from which it came . the boy , immediately on receiving the king 's commands . stepped forward towards [male] 's chair , and , kneeling on one knee .
when the house was done [female] pan took [female] 's hat for the chimney . and the little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that smoke at once began to come out through the hat . all that night [female] pan walked up and down in front of [female] 's house . to watch over her and keep her from danger while she slept , all these children lived in an underground cave . and the next day , when [female] got well , they all went down into the cave and [female] agreed to be their mother and [male] their father .
when prince [male] had eaten until he could eat no more . he threw himself down upon one of the couches and fell asleep . when he awoke , he noticed , for the first time . the walls which , by the way , were really the strangest part of his new home . they had in them twelve long , chequered windows which reached from the ceiling to the floor .
the spae woman came outside and saw what [female] was looking at -- the sword on the ground . it is wrought with cunning that only the smiths of kings possess , ', she said . she took the sword and hung it on the branch of a tree so that the dews of the ground might not rust it . i think the one who owns it is the stranger who is seen in the wild places hereabouts . the man whom the neighbors call the hunter king ,
she knew , too , that with the coming of the new faith trouble would come upon the fairy folk . and their power and their great majesty would depart from them . and men would call them demons . and would drive them out with psalm singing and with the saying of prayers , and with the sound of little tinkling bells . so trouble and anger wrought in the witch woman .
the rusty padlocks were broken , and each fell clanking on the floor , and was brushed away by mailed heels . they passed from room to room with torches . for the cavern extended far beneath the earth ; yet they found no treasure save the jewelled table of [female] . but for their great expectations , this table alone might have proved sufficient to reward their act of daring . some believed that it had been brought by the romans from [female] 's temple .
upon this they all left the place , and went home . the man walked off to his own house in high glee at having passed a jovial night . and got rid of his [male] into the bargain . so he told the story to all his friends . who congratulated him warmly on being cured of his [male] , but there was a neighbour of his who was also troubled with a [male] of long standing .
there he determined to go , but first he rode right down the horrible trail of [female] . and [female] had lived in a cave with iron doors . a cave dug deep down in the earth . and full of gold bracelets , and crowns , and rings . and there , too , [male] found the helm of dread .
[female] the fairy game very much , the fairy by a wave of her sceptre . gave him the power to float through the air . and the game was one of hide and seek among the crystals . all too soon for [female] , the fairies , in obedience to a word from her majesty . ceased their play , and stood before her , she gave her commands .
upon this intelligence the sultan of casgar sent an officer to the place of execution . go , said he , with all expedition , and tell the judge to bring the accused persons before me immediately and bring also the corpse of poor hunch back . that i may see him once more , accordingly the officer went . and happened to arrive at the place of execution at the very time that the executioner had laid his hands upon the tailor . he called aloud to him to suspend the execution .
had not [female] said that she was a combination of hideous things ? why should we delay in our words ? perhaps [female] was right ! it might be so , enough -- when [female] looked at her as she slept there on her couch . he held his breath and no longer played on the magic flute . he was petrified by this wonder of wonders .
martyn describes the [female] of the western isles as a tall man . and he tells a story of his invisibly directing a person . at sir [male] , who was playing at draughts , where to place his men . the great peculiarity of the manks fairies . according to mr. [male] , is their fondness for riding .
this woman was very beautiful , and the people loved her . for some time she sat in the peace wigwam . and tended faithfully the peace fire , into the heart of each there leaped the desire that she might tend his wigwam fire . the peacemaker listened to the quarrel of the young chiefs and settled it justly . then each tried to persuade her to leave the peace fire and return with him to his lodge .
rufus felt some relief at seeing his guest appear this morning . his dreams would have been pleasanter had he been perfectly sure that she would not in her youthful horror and despair evade him in the one way possible . he bade her good morning with an inoffensive commonplace . he had shot his bolt ; now his policy must be soothing and unexacting until her fear of him had abated and custom had reconciled her to her new life . she was silent at breakfast , speaking only when spoken to , and observant of his mother 's needs .
so saying , [male] bade [male] and his lovely bride farewell . and leaning on the traveler 's staff she set off for home . she reached her little cottage on a bright spring day . just when the apple tree was decked in clouds of fragrant . pinky white blossoms , and looked as lovely as a fairy tree .
then the bird maiden told him how she used to live in a golden castle that was all her own . how she ate from crystal dishes and bathed every morning in a little marble bath tub . and had nothing to do all day but swing in her golden swing and sing for her own pleasure . but after a while she grew tired of all this and began to wonder what the outside world was like . and one the day the sun was so bright and the air so sweet that she left her home and flew out into the wide , wide world .
one time there lived ( that is to say , if half a crust of bread a day and sleeping on a bed of hay may so be rated ) . a [male] youth who tuned his lay to all the metres of the day . but was not , i regret to say , appreciated , there was no choice but to obey . he left the town at break of day . yet still his heart was brave and gay ; fate could not [male] him .
from the stories which have already been quoted some idea may be gained of the part which evil spirits play in russian popular fiction . in one of them figures the ghoul which feeds on the dead , in several ( nos . 37 . 38 , 45 48 ) we see the fiend haunted corpse hungering after human flesh and blood . the history of the bad wife proves how a demon may suffer at a woman 's hands . that of the dead witch shows to what indignities the remains of a wicked woman may be subjected by the fiends with whom she has chosen to associate .
but when it was some while since these things had befallen , the dusk was come . all suddenly , and there passed strangely over the pool a shivering , and from it rose a mist that hid it . the heart of flame was troubled , and lifting his eyes to see what was toward . he saw before him momently a figure of sorrow . [female] , the old gray woman of shadows .
they crossed the grinning skull of the gray wolf . they softened the eyes of the antelope 's head . and made dark lines behind the long tined antlers of the elk and of the deer . they brought forth to view in alternate eclipse and definition the great . [person] bear 's head which hung above the mantel .
try as they might they could not bestow on him the pop eyes . big ears , and broad , distended mouth that parted in a smile so evident of inward satisfaction . he was as fair and sightly as one could wish to be , yet he would rather have looked like a [male] . only in size did he resemble one , while they were making their first awkward overtures of friendship the attention of all was suddenly diverted to two ordinary brownies rolling a watermelon up the steep hill . the melon was perhaps thrice their size , and they puffed and grunted over what to them was a herculean task .
chinatown was celebrating the harvest moon festival . and [female] charlton was glad that she had an opportunity to see something of the celebration before she returned east . mrs. [female] , familiar with the chinese people and the mazes of chinatown . led her around fearlessly , pointing out this and that object of interest and explaining to her its meaning . seeing that it was a gala night .
kit laughed out loud with gladness , for at last he had found a good reason for a fight . and no one would be able to call him a coward any more . but before there was time to strike a single blow , the giant gave a loud howl of alarm . took to his heels , and in another moment was completely out of sight . [male] turned in amazement to his little princess .
it must be remembered throughout that we are dealing with the atlantean race only . so that any reference would be out of place that bore on the still more degraded fetish worship that even then existed . as it still does -- amongst the debased representatives of the lemurian peoples . all through the centuries then the various rituals composed to celebrate these various forms of worship were carried on . till the final submergence of [location] , by which time the countless hosts of atlantean emigrants had already established on foreign lands the various cults of the mother continent .
little red riding hood immediately set out , with a basket filled with the cakes and the pot of butter . for her grandmother 's house , which was in a village a little distant from her mother 's . as she was crossing a wood , which lay in her road . she met a gaffer wolf . who had a great mind to eat her up , but dared not indulge his wicked wish .
hence many of the denizens of the castle became weary of life . particularly the lady may , who lived there centuries ago , and who being long ailing . and longing for death , requested to be carried out of the building to die . her importunity at length prevailed ; and , according to the tradition . no sooner did she leave it than she expired .
there was once , i sha not tell you where , it is enough if i tell you that there was somewhere a tumble down oven . which was in first rate condition barring the sides , and there were some cakes baking in it . this person ( the narrator points to some one present ) . has eaten some of them , well then , on the mountains of komárom . on the glass bridges , on the beautiful golden chandelier .
but if she could not steal the casket and its contents for herself . at least she could get another like it , and perhaps a still richer one . so she bade her own daughter sit on the edge of the well . and threw her into the water , exactly as she had done to the other girl . and , exactly as before , the flowery meadow lay at the bottom .
when his helmet and sword were buckled on him . he prayed them to leave him . as he would fain be alone for a short space before he mounted his horse . so the two ladies embraced him and left him . wishing him god speed , as the door closed upon them .
just as the last frog was changed , a mighty rushing noise was heard . the magician flew raging through the air , with his magic staff he struck the poor goat a fierce blow . and then rode back on him to blocksberg , here it went very badly with him . because he came without the soul of the little laplander . and he was severely punished , [male] , with [male] and all his men .
but from the other side of the hedge he flung at the three children a handful of black mud . a bit of it hit princess [female] on the forehead . and another bit fell upon prince [male] 's nose . and another upon little prince [male] 's chin . and there those three black spots stayed ; and all the washing and scrubbing in the world would not make them go away .

time crept on , and [female] was a maid of twelve summers . then did a wicked jealousy find root in [female] 's heart . and so did it grow that it strangled the love which she had borne her sister 's children . in bitterness she cried : [female] careth not for me . to [female] and her brothers hath he given all his love .
one small shrub , called `` pu ug ' , '' is planted near the house as a fiber plant . and is no longer known to the igorot in the wild state , much of the [male] from which the basket work splints are made is purchased from people west of [male] . and , lastly , there is no doubt that a certain care is taken in preserving pine trees for large boards and timbers and for coffins . there is a cutting away of dead and small branches from these trees , moreover , the cutting of other trees and shrubs for firewood certainly has a beneficial effect upon the forest trees left standing . in fact , all persons preserve the small pitch pine trees on private lands .

afterward , as soon as could be , the vizier 's son married the old farmer 's daughter . and a most happy marriage it was , a sparrow once built a nice little house for herself . and lined it well with wool and protected it with sticks . so that it resisted equally the summer sun and the winter rains . a crow who lived close by had also built a house , but it was not such a good one .
prince [male] obeyed her ; and , sitting down , began thus : mighty queen . your majesty is not mistaken in thinking there is something extraordinary in the story of my life . it is indeed more so than you can imagine , the ills . the incredible torments , i have suffered , and the death to which i was devoted . and from which i am delivered by your generosity , will show , when i have related them .

the next morning the ship entered the harbour of the neighbouring king 's magnificent city . the church bells rang and trumpets were sounded from every lofty tower . while the soldiers paraded with flags flying and glittering bayonets . there was a fete every day , there was a succession of balls . and receptions followed one after the other , but the princess was not yet present .
the other , whose village it was , full stopped the story with grunts or deprecations . there had been some throats cut , folk had been bidden to lie down , so the teller said . they had lain down as for the lash , but they had been paid in cold steel . [male] listened dazedly , the end of his [male] era seemed to have come as suddenly and unexplainedly as the end of his pagan era . his teacher had preached `` love , '' `` love , '' `` love , '' with [male] iteration .
she lived , but the waters of the spring were glowing red and warm with the lifeblood of the terrible beast . his glowing eyes grew dim and sightless . in the river of death , and in its place . to her sight appeared the handsome young gold seeker , with all her intense emotion . she was calm , as only an indian [female] could be , but a deep glowing flush burned through the darkness of her cheek .

so all came again into the other room , and [male] was made to sit down . and everybody drank his health , and he drank everybody 's health at one offer . and six stout fellows saw himself and the master home . and waited in the parlor while he went up and brought down the two hundred guineas . and double wages for [male] himself .
all who were present shouted with laughter at [female] 's speech . for who would believe that any one would be so generous as to spend all upon another and none upon himself ? so poor [male] was beaten with rods until he confessed where he had hidden his money . then the wise judge handed fifty sequins to [male] and kept twenty himself for his decision . and all went their way praising his justice and judgment .

the cloth which covered his face was lifted up ; the dead man 's face expressed peace . a sunbeam fell upon it , a swallow flew with the swiftness of an arrow into the arbour . turning in its flight , and twittered over the dead man 's head . the withered oak leaf in the book here recalled the friend . the schoolfellow , who was to be his friend for life .

dancing was at all times forbidden by [organization] on account of its tendency to corrupt the morals . and for centuries ecclesiastical authority was strenuously opposed to it . but , on the other hand , it could not complain of want of encouragement from the civil power . when king [male] , in 554 , forbade all dances in his domains . he was only induced to do so by the influence of the bishops .

so they rode out of the valley and up the hill side . and they waved their hands to the wonderful toymaker who stood looking disconsolately after them . and they wished they could have played with him just a little longer . they had very little time even to wish , however , for the rocking horses rushed over the ground at such a pace that they could see nothing they were passing . so , after all , they would have been none the wiser if they had come by sky as [male] had wished .

despite all attempts at resistance one after another fell asleep ; and [female] herself came pretty near dozing off . when she suddenly saw something round and dark rise on the top of a wave , `` seals , seals , seals ! '' cried [female] in a high , shrill voice , and raised herself up in the air with resounding wing strokes . it was just at the crucial moment , before the last wild goose had time to come up from the water . the seals were so close to her that they made a grab for her feet .
as she trod cautiously through dim corridors [female] was glad that . saving the guards , no creature was astir , and that for some time yet she need account to no person for her movements . she was glad also of a respite which would enable her to settle into her home and draw about her the composure which women feel when they are surrounded by the walls of their houses . and can see about them the possessions which , by the fact of ownership . have become almost a part of their personality , sundered from her belongings .
the sun is called the egg laid by the primeval goose . and in later time this was said to be laid by a god , or modelled by [female] . evidently this goose egg is a primitive tale which was adapted to later theology . the sky is said to be upheld by four pillars , these were later connected with the gods of the four quarters . but the primitive four pillars were represented together , with the capitals one over the other .
and the magpie chuckled , and chuckled , and chuckled in such guffaws , fluttering from branch to branch as mr. [male] trudged along . that at last he flew into a violent rage and flung his stick at the bird . and the stick stuck in a tree out of his reach . so he had to go back to his wife without anything at all . but he was glad the stick had stuck in a tree .
he soon landed , and leaving his basket on the beach . he walked up to the large gateway , the pillars of the gate were made of beautiful red [male] . and the gate itself was adorned with glittering gems of all kinds . large [location] trees overshadowed it . our hero had often heard of the wonders of the sea king 's palace beneath the sea .
the count took the fly flapper ; and then they all set to work to drive away [female] ink . [female] and [female] and their mother took table napkins . and made sweeps with them in the air . driving the [male] backward and forward . here and there , while the count kept striking at him with the fly flapper , at last the count managed to hit the [male] 's coat tails .
away it flew like a bullet , up and up it went . so high in the air that the earth below looked like a black blanket spread out in the night . and then down it came again , with the soldier still griping tight to the legs . until at last it settled as light as a feather upon a balcony of the king 's palace . and when the soldier caught his wind again he found himself without a hat .
so he took a piece of stick . and made some holes in the ground , and put in the beans . that day they had very little dinner . and went sadly to bed , knowing that for the next day there would be none and [male] . unable to sleep from grief and vexation , got up at day dawn and went out into the garden .
[female] hastened to the woods and threw himself down by the bank of a little brook , ah yes ! spring has come , how the little birds sing , how the [male] breezes whisper , yet listen ! what is it [male] hears beyond the song of the birds . the whisper of the breeze ? on the air floats the sound of silver bells . [male] raises his head , tinkle , tinkle , tinkle !
in front of the fire three men were sitting clothed in white . just as if it was summer , and for about thirty feet all round winter had been banished . the moss was dry and the plants green , while the grass seemed all alive with the [male] of bees and cockchafers . but above the noise the son of long [male] could hear the whistling of the wind and the crackling of the branches as they fell beneath the weight of the snow , well ! you son of long [male] .
the wish passed round , and the glasses clashed together till they rang again . while before the town gate the mail coach stopped with the twelve strange passengers . and who were these strangers ? each of them had his passport and his luggage with him . they even brought presents for me . and for you , and for all the people in the town .
while the old man was busy , cutting and trimming the great blocks of stone . the lad would play among the chips , sometimes he would make a little statue of soft clay . sometimes he would take hammer and chisel . and try to cut a statue from a piece of rock . he showed so much skill that his grandfather was de light ed .
he was soon able to imitate every one in the street ; he could make fun of all their peculiarities and failings . he will turn out a clever fellow , ', said people . but it was all that bit of glass in his heart . that bit of glass in his eye . and it made him tease little [male] who was so devoted to him .
`` thank you , '' said the merchant 's son . and he went into the wood , sat himself in his trunk . flew on to the roof , and crept through the window into the princess 's room . she was lying on the sofa asleep . and was so beautiful that the young merchant had to kiss her , then she woke up and was very much frightened .
and forever after o [female] and ku yum lived happily together in a glad . beautiful old palace , surrounded by a glad , beautiful old garden . on a charming little island in the middle of a lake . [male] was dozing in a big red chair , beside him stood the baby 's cradle . a thick basket held in a stout framework of wood .
i did not sleep but kept watch all night . and then he went on to tell what the crows had said , and as he spoke he turned to stone up to his knees . the prince called to him to say no more as he had proved his innocence . but the servant paid no heed to him . and by the time his story was done he had turned to stone from head to foot .
the princess turned the key and the door swung open . beyond she saw a room , and an old , old , wrinkled woman sat there at a wheel spinning . the princess had never seen a spinning wheel before , it seemed a curious thing to her . she went in and stood close to the old woman so as to see it better . `` it is a curious little thing , '' said the princess .
once more he bowed himself in prayer . once more his father appeared before him , on the following day there was a great gathering at the palace . and , in the midst of it , sat princess [female] the fair demanding her bridegroom . the one who had leapt to her lips and won her from all others . her heart and soul and body were his .
sometimes , at long intervals , he even went to live there himself . on which occasions his troubles in regard to it multiplied so exceedingly that he swore they were half demons . as the name of their kingdom , nokkëland , proved . and for his part he wished they could find an evil spirit like themselves to govern them in his stead . as no mere mortal could , and then , as he could think of nothing else .
their sisters , hygeia , and panacea . had temples dedicated to them , and received divine honours . the function of hygeia was to maintain the health of the community . which great blessing was supposed to be brought by her as a direct and beneficent gift from the gods . the worship of [female] was introduced into rome from epidaurus .
a young woman herding cattle drove her charge to a sequestered part of the hill . and while there a young man came her way , and reclining his head on her lap fell asleep . on his stretching himself she observed that he had horse hoofs . and lulling him gently managed to get his head rested on the ground . she then cut out with her scissors the part of her clothes below his head and made her escape .
he gazed at her in wonder , when suddenly she began to dance . her movements were so graceful that he forgot to play , and as soon as the notes of his flute ceased she vanished from his sight . the next day the same thing happened , but on the third he took courage . and drew a little nearer , playing on his flute all the while . suddenly he sprang forward , seized her in his arms and kissed her .
it was a nice breakfast , coffee and rolls . fresh butter and eggs , and jams and other nice things . lady [female] said her [female] . sat down , poured herself out a cup of coffee and raised it to her rosy lips . lady [female] let the cup fall with a crash .
so the prince went back , and brought some more water , and again a hoop sprang . and for the third time the voice still called for water . and when water was given it the last hoop was rent . the cask fell in pieces , and out flew a dragon . who snatched up the empress just as she was returning from her walk .
five minutes later , as he started on his twenty one mile walk home . he realised that this was one of the ones which you could not . this , then , was the real reason of the war between euralia and [male] . i am aware that in saying this i differ from the eminent historian , [male] . in chapter ix of his immortal work .
the noise they made woke golden hair . and you may imagine how frightened she was when she saw the three bears . she started out of bed , and jumped at once out of the window . the bears rushed after her , and father bear caught her golden hair in his teeth . but she left a lock behind .
when he had done this there was a great lake behind them . and this the witch could not cross until she ran home again and brought her dough trough . meanwhile the fugitives had reached the castle which was the prince 's home . they climbed over the garden wall . ran across the garden , and crept in at an open window .
he struck a hundred times -- a hundred ships . they moved around the island under full canvas . with sailors and cannon , the sailors run and fire guns . the commanders come to the merchant for orders . he amused himself , hid his axe .
in the land of annam there once dwelt a man named [male] . who sailed the seas as a merchant , once his ship was suddenly driven on a distant shore by a great storm . it was a land of hills broken by ravines and green with luxuriant foliage . yet he could see something along the hills which looked like human dwellings . so he took some food with him and went ashore .
ah , he had no trouble from that quarter . for when the newly wedded couple arrived at the castle , she had already disappeared . happy , indeed , were the long bright days , which the prince and his new bride spent together . whether in the castle , or out doors , riding on horseback . or in hunting the deer , every day , her beauty seemed diviner .
this cock made himself very annoying to the king of the cats . he used to strut up and down saying to himself over and over again , i m [male] the walk , i m [male] ', the walk. sometimes he would come into the forge and say it to the horses . the king of the cats wondered how the human beings could put up with a creature who was so stupid and so vain .
his mother told him to try her with bread half baked . that is , midway between hard crust and soft dough , it was a day of rain and shine . of sun burst and cloud , but no lady appeared . the long hours , of watching and waiting , sped on , until it was nearly dark . when just about to turn homewards , to ease his mother 's anxiety .
there is a queen now as well as a king of the monotonous isles . she has black hair and blue eyes . and she wears a crown instead of a sunbonnet , and she quite agrees with the king whenever he tells her how beautiful their kingdom is . and if this should seem remarkable to some people , it need only be remembered that the queen sees everything with the king 's eyes . there was once a king who was so fond of hunting that all the rabbits in his kingdom were born with their hearts in their mouths .
it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression ; but their colour and shape . and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied , [ starting , as if from a reverie. . ] so it is , thank you . i have a partner , [ looking after [female] with a smile . turns to [female] , ] you must be tired , miss bennet .
and the sun said no , but that perhaps the wind had seen it . for he entered everywhere , and saw things that no one else ever saw . and if anyone knew where it was , it was certainly the wind . then the poor young man again set forth as well as his horse could take him . begging his living as he went , and , somehow or other , he ended by reaching the home of the wind .
he flung his arms round the beautiful being . and gazed into her wonderfully clear eyes , -- only for a moment ; but in that moment words can not express the effect of his gaze . was it the spirit of life or of death that overpowered him ? was he rising higher , or sinking lower and lower into the deep , deadly abyss ? he knew not ; but the walls of ice shone like blue-green glass .
so he sent out brahmans and jugis to search the world to find a raja with five unmarried daughters . and at the same time the chandmuni raja had five marriagable daughters . and he made up his mind that he would marry them to five brothers . he did not care what their rank in life was . but he was determined to find a family of five brothers to marry his daughters .
so [female] went back to his people , and told them what [male] had said . and being now agreed together , they all hobbled off but three , who were left to guard the bundles . to break and cut down wood , and to see if perhaps among the thorns grew any nut trees . but they found none ; and for their pains were only scratched and stung by these waste trees which bear a deadly poison in their long hooked thorns . this poison , like the english nettle , causes a terrible itch to follow wherever the thorns scratch .
the cat standing on the steps put up its back and cried `` mew . '' but [male] had no inclination for this sort of conversation . he passed on , and knocked at the door , no one heard him . no one opened the door , `` mew , '' said the cat again ; and had [male] been still a child .
`` here i am , '' said the prince from the top of the hill . then the flat , white head set itself against the edge of the chink from which it had peeped . and slowly , like the movement of a sheet of ice . it slipped upwards and curled upwards . and up , and up , there seemed no end to it at all ; and it moved horribly .
both the tall and bracket clocks showed this same love of ornament and they were carved and gilded and enriched with chased brass and wonderful inlay by [location] . the dials also were beautifully designed , consoles , tables , cabinets . etc. , were all treated in this elaborate way , many of the ceilings were painted by great artists . and those at versailles , painted by le brun and others . are good examples , there was always a combination of the straight line and the curve .
mr. [male] says that this superstition obtains credence in [male] and [location] . and that in westphalia , a dog howling along a road is considered a sure sign that a funeral soon will pass that way . in the scandinavian mythology , [male] , goddess of death . is visible only to dogs , the superstition has , at any rate . antiquity to recommend it , and it seems evident from exodus xi .
the painter , who wanted to get to paradise , had to go up a staircase which he had himself painted . but which no man could mount , that was to expiate his sins against perspective . all the plants and buildings , which the property man had placed . with infinite pains , in countries to which they did not belong . the poor fellow was obliged to put in their right places before [male] .
this had been cut out , like a window , for the bow and arrow men , and was usually occupied by a sentinel . sword in hand , [male] made for the giant 's own room . glaring at the youth , the big fellow seized his club and brought it down with such force that it went through the wooden floor . but [male] dodged the blow and , in a trice . made a [male] with his sword , cutting off the giant 's head .
`` who are you ? '' asked the child in astonishment . as he rubbed his sleepy eyes , [male] rose at once . took the dwarf 's hand , and walked away by his side . they soon reached the clump of ferns that covered the secret entrance . and stepped into the vaulted corridor , the first door opened , and the child found himself suddenly in the enchanted realm of his mother 's stories .
[male] had heard it likewise , wroth were they both . they summoned their knights , that were soon ready , straightway , as i will tell you . a mighty host , strongly armed , rode to them that had suffered scathe . to gelfrat come more than seven hundred , when these set out to pursue their [male] foemen . the leaders spurred hotly after the strangers , to be revenged , by the which they lost many friends .
farmers , with produce of their own growing suspended from their shoulders on stout [female] poles . would come along at their accustomed [male] , and would gaze at these words , `` the wonderful man , '' with a curious look on their faces , they were not profound scholars . for on account of their poverty they had been compelled to leave school before they had mastered the ancient characters which make up the chinese written language . but they knew enough to read such simple words as these , but what did the words really mean ?
`` after such a journey , '' said mrs. [female] . there were just the three , [female] being the third ; and [female] and the three other girls . i understand , hung about in a general sort of way up and down the staircase ( to the great annoyance of the servants who were thus kept out of it altogether ) . confirming one another 's views of the tail , arguing on the theory of mermaids . revisiting the garden and beach and trying to invent an excuse for seeing the invalid again .
the king said he had not , he asked him how he got the box from which the light came . he said he had no box . the king said he had , and that he must give it to him . that he would not keep him , unless he gave him the box . the boy gave it to him .

`` how long beloved ? '' asked the princess anxiously , for she was much ashamed of the way in which she had wooed him . `` all my life long , '' he answered , and the peacocks never told how he kissed her . his majesty the king and her majesty the queen were delighted with the match . the royal father spent hours in telling the young prince how great a delight his daughter 's mind had always been to him . and how he should miss companionship with her when she was far away in bobitania .
`` bring me the princess [female] this moment , '' stammered he , `` for if you return without her i will have you drowned ! '' and without another word he left the hall . leaving [female] staring with surprise and horror . there were rows upon rows of fine beasts with their names written in gold above their stalls .
the poodle , to show that he had understood . shook the case of blue satin three or four times and ran off like a race horse . shortly afterwards a beautiful little carriage came out of the coach house , the cushions were stuffed with canary feathers and it was lined on the inside with whipped cream . custard and vanilla wafers . the little carriage was drawn by a hundred pairs of white mice .
then the farmer , who knew their ways , bade brown mount behind him on his horse [male] . for he warned him that in five minutes `` the whole clanjamphrey '' would be down upon them , and even as he spoke five or six men made their appearance . running toward them over the moss , but [male] was staunch . and by dint of following the safest roads , and being left to pick his own way in the difficult places .
fairy grave felt so fatigued with having done so much in so short a time . that she requested fairy reveuse to fly to the top of the tower and enchant the air about it so powerfully and completely that not even a bird should be able to go near it . the fairy obeyed ; but as she was an exceedingly absent being , she forgot some of the necessary ceremonies . and made some few mistakes , if the enchantment of the water had not been more perfect than that of the air . the safe keeping of [female] , which they took so much trouble about .
one day the step mother , the step-sister . and the pretty princess sat together in the castle garden beside a deep cistern of water . by the cistern hung a silver cup for the use of those who wished to drink . and as they sat there the princess grew thirsty , and would have taken the cup to quench her thirst . but the step mother stopped her , but as the princess thus stooped and drank .

then they all looked upon [female] , but no one spoke . if words were to be said , it was [female] 's place to say them . and that dreadful silence seemed to cry : `` speak out , [male] , for your last hour has come ! '' [male] was no coward , he stood erect before them all and plucked from his breast the star of his office and cast away from him the weapon he had worn . he was magnificent in that last , evil hour !
once on a time there was a poor but very good little girl , who lived alone with her mother . and when my story begins , they had nothing in the house to eat . so the child went out into the forest , and there she met an old woman . who already knew her distress , and who presented her with a pot which had the following power . if one said to it , `` boil , little pot ! ''
no man or child could be seen anywhere to ask what all this might mean . but one day , as he walked his horse beside a brook . over the long grass , he came upon a poor half starved peasant who had not strength to run . and the man knelt before him , and bared his breast . and said , `` strike , sir knight , and end my [male] ! ''
it took the two little mermaids but a few minutes to undress . and as soon as their tired heads touched the pillow they were sound asleep . softly the seabells are ringing away , dipping and dripping and white with the spray . ding dong , and ding dong , and ding dong , so deep , the seabells are singing me softly to sleep . over and over again in her dreams little [female] repeated this song , then suddenly the bells seemed to change their tune .
through the red mist that floated all around her , she could see high walls of changing light . where orange , blue , and violet flames went flickering to and fro . making graceful figures as they danced and glowed ; and underneath these rainbow arches . little spirits glided , far and near , wearing crowns of fire . beneath which flashed their wild , bright eyes ; and as they spoke .

the women stopped washing and looked at one another in astonishment , it was not every day that they came across a bird that could sing a song like that . and they felt that there was something not canny about it . so the bird sang its song over again , and the washerwomen gave it all the clothes . and it tucked them under its right wing . and flew on , presently it came to a house where all the windows were open .
[person] was an ancient town , mysteriously sown , centuries ago . like a wandering thistle down of human life , amid the silence and the nibbling sheep of the great chalk downs . it stood in a hollow of the long smooth billows of pale pasture that suavely melted into the sky on every side . the evening was so still that the little river running across the threshold of the town . and encircling what remained of its old walls , was the noisiest thing to be heard .
so they journeyed until they came to their lands at narberth . there they gathered their dogs round them . and hunted for a year as before , after that a strange thing happened , one morning [person] and [person] rose up to hunt . and loosened their dogs , which ran before them , till they came to a small [person] . at the [person] , the dogs shrank away as if frightened , and returned to their masters .
the sultan then commanded the drums , trumpets , cymbals . and other instruments of music to announce his joy to the public . and a festival of ten days to be proclaimed for the return of the princess and [female] . within a few years afterward , the sultan died in a good old age . and as he left no male children , the princess [male] .
once upon a time a raja married a princess from a distant country and . after a short stay there , decided to take his wife home . but she refused to go until he had declared his lineage . the raja told her she would regret her curiosity . but she persisted , finally he took her to the river and there warned her again .
anjuta felt that for nothing in the world would she go back alone . the wood from which she had happily emerged inspired her afterwards with such fear . that she began to run , and sped over the snowy plain like an arrow . a strange sight brought her to a standstill , four riders with long lances in their hands and guns slung across their backs rode by the side of a sledge . in which sat a stout man , he looked very grand .
yes , yes , the landlord knew how much of that cake to eat , he was not to have the wool pulled over his eyes so easily . see , now , he knew very well that thieving had been done , and he would have them all up before the master mayor for it . so the upshot of the matter was that they had to take him in to share with them . just then came along a company of soldiers—tramp , tramp ! tramp ! —and there they found them all sharing the money between them , except [male] , `` hi ! ''
in the grey morning [male] 's servant found his master cold and dead . at his feet stood the [male] lantern burning with a weird yellow flame . the servant shivered , took up the lantern and blew out the light . for `` i can not bear it , '' he said . this is a tale beloved by the children of [location] .
under a purer form of religion , the cruciform stripes which mark the back and shoulders of the patient ass first appeared . according to the popular tradition , when the son of god condescended to enter the holy city . mounted on that animal ; and a fish only to be found in the sea stills bears the impress of the finger and [male] of the apostle . who drew him out of the waters of lake tiberias to take the tribute money that lay in his mouth . the repetition of the voice among the hills is .
balna determined to take her son 's advice . and the next day sent for [male] , and spoke to him as had been suggested . the magician greatly delighted , begged her to allow the wedding to take place as soon as possible . but she told him that before she married him he must allow her a little more time . in which she might make his acquaintance , and that , after being enemies so long .
shortly afterwards he expired , leaving universal regret throughout the kingdom . rich and poor alike followed him to the grave , [male] showed every mark of the deepest grief at his father 's death . and for long refused to see any one , at length a day came when . one of his friends being admitted , urged him strongly to be consoled , and to resume his former place in society . this advice [male] was not slow to follow , and soon he formed little society of ten young men all about his own age .
when the old king saw this he foamed with rage . stared wildly about , flung himself on the ground and died . the servant stayed on with his royal master and served him faithfully all the rest of his life . and , if neither of them is dead , he is serving him still . the king had already put ninety nine people to death .
the summit of the tree was a wide spreading garden . and in the midst of it , where the green boughs formed a kind of hill . stood a castle of crystal , with a view from it towards every quarter of heaven . each tower was erected in the form of a [person] . and within the stern was a winding staircase , through which one could ascend to the top and step out upon the leaves as upon balconies .
the next morning [female] went to pay a visit to the merchant his friend . who received him in the most obliging manner ; and expressed great joy at his return . after so many years absence ; telling him , that he had begun to lose all hopes of ever seeing him again . after the usual compliments on both sides on such a meeting . [male] desired the merchant to return him the jar of olives which he had left with him .
a tall figure stood among the shadows of the trees . as it raised its head , a beam of moonlight fell on its face . in a moment she knew him . her promised bridegroom , a loud shriek at that moment burst upon her ear . and her aunt , who had been awakened by the music and had followed her to the window .
the king was full of joy and love . and showed it by the way he kissed her . love , however , never did believe in wasting time , so he took the queen to [female] . the queen gave the compliments of the fairy [female] . and begged her to give her the essence of long life .
the huntsman and his wife and [male] then went back to their beds . and the little man , having finished his supper , curled himself up by the fire . and was soon fast asleep , about an hour after a loud clap of thunder awakened [male] . and before it had died away he heard three knocks at the door . he aroused his parents and told them .
the king of the country , in his treatment of his visitor . showed his peculiar nature very plainly , sometimes he would receive him with enthusiastic delight . while at others he would upbraid him with having left his dominions to go wandering around the earth in this senseless way . one day his host invited him to attend a royal dinner . but , when he went to the grand dining hall , pleased with anticipations of a splendid feast .
he ripped out the paper of the largest window pane and pushed his way through into the studio . then in great haste he took up paint pot and brush . and sacrilegiously set himself to work upon [male] 's last masterpiece . in the place of the doorway by which [male] had entered he painted a solid brick wall . twice over he painted it , making it two bricks thick .
one morning , a balmy morning in spring . i was sitting cross legged on my worktable at the rear of my shop . busily plying the needle , when a stranger , richly dressed , entered my open door from the street . and approached me , bowing courteously , he was a handsome man . wearing a short beard ; and i remarked with surprise , by contrast with his beard .
soon after the adventure of the pudding , [female] 's mother went to milk her cow in the meadow . and she took him along with her . as the wind was very high , fearing lest he should be blown away , she tied him to a [male] with a piece of fine thread . the cow soon saw the oak leaf hat , and , liking the look of it . took poor [female] and the [female] at one mouthful .
after the other guests had left , and [female] had gone to bed . the emir and the prince chatted and smoked together for some time . by and by , the former offered to conduct the latter to his sleeping apartment . when they came to the foot of the grand staircase . which was of white marble , [male] , looking up , was horrified to behold an enormous black lion stretched upon the topmost landing .
[male] , replied [male] . [male] , [male] , he repeated , in a singing tone . just as he had been saying it all the time as he walked along . as if he loved the sound of it .
you will be happier , spite of all these trials . than you have ever been , if you only resolve to be firm in the path of duty . to strive to do well always ; to return a kind answer for a harsh word . and , above all , to control your temper , there may be times when this may seem impossible . but always remember that one angry word provokes another , and that thus the beautiful gem of wedded affection is tarnished .
when she arose in the morning , she communicated to her sister the intention she had formed . and they both began to feel less dread than they had experienced since the discoveries in the fatal closet . the day advanced , and they looked forward to the arrival of the relatives and friends whom they had invited to this day 's entertainment . however , in the midst of their mutual congratulations upon the plan which had been formed . they heard the arrival of a carriage at the castle .
he longed to be at her side . to embrace her , to call her his own ; and unable to remain longer a silent admirer . he rushed out and endeavored to seize this twelfth beauty who so enchanted him . but the sisters , the moment they descried the form of a man . leaped back into the basket with the swiftness of birds .
all that day she floated , and all the next night . and towards sunset the following evening she found herself close to [female] 's garden . just at the moment that the king , on the horse of flame . was returning from hunting , `` who are you ? '' he asked in surprise . for old women travelling on rafts were not common in that country .
oh , there was nothing but tangled yarn at home . the grey goose grew live feathers for other folk 's picking . the sausage was stuffed for other folk 's feasting . and the cock crowed in the morn for other folk 's waking . that was the way of the world over yonder , and so they had left it .
the wicked woman went green and purple with jealousy and rage . and running to the chief magistrate , she told him that while she was flying a kite with her child fastened to its back . [female] had come and had cut the string , so that by her doing the child was now dead . when the magistrate heard that , he sent and caused [male] to be thrown into prison . and told her that the next day she should certainly be put to death .
if i now blow across the mouth of the jar you hear the same note . showing that a cavity of a particular length will only sound to the waves which fit it . do you see now the reason why pan pipes give different sounds . or even the hole at the end of a common key when you blow across it ? here is a subject you will find very interesting if you will read about it .
they set to work with a will , patiently putting the big pieces in order . and then searching for the small bits to fit in , a long , long time it took . and knowing that the least [person] might mean the whole of the crockery falling to pieces . and the pieces all having to be put together again , they tried so hard to be patient that not a single [person] escaped one of them . ah , if they had but known it .
to keep the white light from dazzling with its [person] , the tall green seaweeds waved about . lending a delicious , cool shade , like the green trees on the dry land . so that everything was agreeable to the eye , a magnificent banquet was served immediately . and then they were shown the wonders of the sea palace . rooms filled with costly treasures were opened ; chests of brilliant jewels were examined .
the porters , sweepers , and dock labourers went without bread and garlic . that they might pay for their places , poets composed epigrams in her honour . bearded philosophers inveighed against her in the baths and gymnasia . when her litter passed , [female] priests turned away their heads . the threshold of her door was wreathed with flowers .
she was worse fed and clothed than any servant in the castle . and the meanest room and the hardest bed were given to her , still she grew in beauty day by day . and every one except the stepmother loved her for her [female] ways and her sweetness . one day the stepmother wished to examine the jewels that had once belonged to the lady [female] . she intended to choose from among them such as she might admire .
the next stage , one of the two illustrated by the igorot of the [female] culture area . is that in which commodities are produced before a widespread or urgent demand exists for them in the minds of those who eventually become consumers through commerce . such commodities result largely from a local demand and a local supply of raw materials . gradually they spread over a widening area , carried by their producers whose home demand is . for the time , supplied , and who desire some commodity to be obtained among another people .
then [female] commenced skinning him , when suddenly something red tinged the air all around him . he rubbed his eyes , thinking he was perhaps deceived . but rub as hard as he would , the red hue still crimsoned the air . and tinged with its delicate [male] every object that he looked on . the tree tops , the river that flowed , and the deer that glided away along the edge of the forest .
as a citizen , he was generous and kind . his heart was full of human sympathy , while his spirit was one of the gentlest that ever dwelt in a tabernacle of clay . although he raised his country to a position of military fame which she had not occupied in previous history . yet war , in his view , had no glory . he loved peace , he desired to live on terms of amity and friendship with the english people and their rulers , but alas , alas !
during the whole of one of a summer 's hottest days i had the good fortune to be seated in a railway car near a mother and four children . whose relations with each other were so beautiful that the pleasure of watching them was quite enough to make one forget the discomforts of the journey . it was plain that they were poor ; their clothes were coarse and old . and had been made by inexperienced hands , the mother 's bonnet alone would have been enough to have condemned the whole party on any of the world 's thoroughfares . i remembered afterward , with shame , that i myself had smiled at the first sight of its antiquated ugliness .
`` now we shall expect to hear what you dream of to night , '' said the youngest brother , as he showed his sister her bedroom . and as she finished speaking , she touched [female] 's hand lightly with the nettle . and a pain as of burning fire awoke her . it was broad daylight , and near her lay a nettle like the one she had seen in her dream .
then the snow began to fall , and each [female] seemed to smother her . she was so very tiny , close to the wood lay a corn field . the beautiful golden grain had been carried away long ago , now there was only dry short stubble . but to little [female] the stubble was like a great forest . she walked through the hard field , she was shaking with cold .
whilst they were talking , he spied on a sudden a boat in the lake . made of red [male] wood , it had a mast of fine amber . and a blue satin flag : there was only one boatman in it . whose head was like an elephant 's , and his body like that of a [male] . when the boat was come up to the prince and [male] .
now , any other than such a wretch would have been grateful , but [male] did not even look upon him . nay , mounting the horse , he rode in [male] of the ruffians . to whom he repeated his orders to kill him . they accordingly surrounded [male] , who , setting his back to a tree . behaved with so much bravery that he laid them all dead at his feet .
it flowed from under the edge of a circle of shining silver . set with alternated pearls and opals , on her dress was no ornament whatever . neither was there a ring on her hand , or a necklace or carcanet about her neck . but her slippers glimmered with the light of the milky way . for they were covered with seed pearls and opals in one mass .
he soon heard a rushing noise as of a loud wind . but could see nothing , presently a large [organization] dropped , as if from the air . upon the otter 's carcass , grasshopper drew his bow . and the arrow passed through under both of his wings , the bird made a convulsive flight upward . with such force that the cumbrous body was borne up several feet from the ground .
as soon as the next moon was full the hunter 's wife went to the mill pond . played on a golden flute , and when she had finished placed it on the bank . then a rushing sound was heard , and a wave swept the flute off the bank . and soon the head of the hunter appeared and rose up higher and higher till he was half out of the water . then he gazed sadly at his wife and stretched out his arms towards her .
she told them day after day of the wonderful festival that was to be . and how happy she would feel if she could join in the dance with the others . `` but it is impossible , my beloved turkeys , ugly and ill clad as i am , '' she would say , when she saw the people of the village busy in cleaning their houses and preparing their clothes . laughing and talking as they made ready for the greatest holiday of the year .
one day , when [male] went to call upon [male] . he was told by the servant maid , who met him at the door . that her master was out , but that her young master , [male] , was at home . so , saying that he would go in and pay his respects to the young gentleman . he entered the house ; and as he suddenly pushed open the sliding door of the room in which [male] was sitting .
in the temple erected to [female] at eleusis . the famous eleusinian mysteries were instituted by the goddess herself . it is exceedingly difficult , as in the case of all secret societies . to discover anything with certainty concerning these sacred rites . the most plausible supposition is that the doctrines taught by the priests to the favoured few whom they initiated .
' i wish they d open the doors and let me get in , the princess said , but as yet there seemed no sign of any one waking up . so she quietly walked to the rose bushes and plucked one or two of the great red damask roses . and chafing the petals off between her hands , threw the handfuls of them at the swans . who hissed and snapped as the mass of red leaves fell over them .
day after day the boy who knew what the birds said went down to the sea shore and worked to lift up the round stone that was over the pit in which king [male] lorc had put his silver keys . and one day he was able to raise up the stone . there lay the great keys , shining in their silver brightness . he took them up , and when he brought them near each other they struck together and they rang like bells , [male] was the the name they chimed out , and they chimed again [male] is lord .
she then went home , [female] , on her return . warmed some water to wash the body , and at the same time [female] perfumed it with incense . and wrapped it in the burying clothes with the accustomed ceremonies . not long after the proper officer brought the bier , and when the attendants of the mosque . whose business it was to wash the dead , offered to perform their duty .
as he was not good and kind , like his brother the fisherman . but extremely wicked , he resolved to send [male] on a dangerous enterprise . in which he would probably be killed , and then to do some great mischief to [female] herself . so this bad hearted king spent a long while in considering what was the most dangerous thing that a young man could possibly undertake to perform . at last , having hit upon an enterprise that promised to turn out as fatally as he desired .
his temperament was such that he did not worry about evils which he was impotent to remedy . in any case , so far as could be judged , the occurrence foretold was not imminent . [male] rochecoupée viewed events as a statesman . and statesmen never look beyond the present moment , i am speaking of the shrewdest and most far sighted . after all , supposing one day the king 's daughter did fall asleep for a hundred years .
he rode hard and fast northwards through the wild and desolate mountains . until he saw the sea like burnished lead lying on his left hand . then in a little while he swooned under the heat of the sun . from hunger and weakness , and lay half in and half out of the brook . it befell that a widowed lady , to whom the brook and the land belonged .
she cried herself to sleep , and when she woke the bag was gone . no one had seen it ; but she told her mamma about the cake . and promised not to do so any more , now this shall be a truly good day . every bit of it , she said . as she skipped away , feeling as light as a feather after she had confessed her little sins .
the rest of the time he talked or walked . till he grew very old , he went aloft a great deal . he always kept up his exercise ; and i never heard that he was ill . if any other man was ill , he was the kindest nurse in the world . and he knew more than half the surgeons do , then if anybody was sick or died .
when the step-sister saw these treasures . she conceived a wicked scheme of punishing [female] through her love for them . so , pretending to repent of her past follies and unkindness , [male] was allowed by the king and queen to live in comfort in their home . as soon as the parents had disappeared , [female] ordered another sleigh to be harnessed . and taking the babies in her arms set forth .
up ran the youths , eager to secure good places : in they crowded . full of interest and talk , `` what 's the case ? '' `` which side is it ? '' do not think them heartless . they are neither better nor worse than you or i ; they get over their professional horrors . and into their proper work -- and in them pity .
the head of the family , listening behind a curtain . heard how the valuable stone in her heap could be discovered , she hastened to find and remove it from the pile . and , when her guest had recovered from the effect of the banquet . he saw that the value had departed from his purchase . he went to negotiate again with the seller , and she conducted the conference with such skill that she obtained the price originally agreed upon for the heap of stones .
ivan replied , `` i will soon show you , '' and , taking an empty bag in his hand , he started for the woods . the little girls laughed as they said , `` what a fool he is ! '' and resuming their play they forgot all about him . some time after [male] suddenly appeared among them carrying in his hand the bag .
so for two whole days he lay quietly among the reeds . eating such food as he could find , and drinking the water of the moorland pool . till he felt himself quite strong again . he wished he might stay were he was for ever . he was so comfortable and happy , away from everyone , with nobody to bite him and tell him how ugly he was .
her only pleasure was to lie amid the green willows near some sparkling stream . at the dawn and at twilight only she seemed happy . when a great storm broke , and the earth was white with hail . she became bright and joyous as the [female] of old ; but when the clouds passed . and the hail melted beneath the sun , [female] would burst into tears and weep as a sister would weep over her brother .
they were now summoned to dinner , [male] placed himself at [male] 's side and they conversed in a most agreeable manner . after dinner the king gave orders for the ball to commence . [male] and [male] , who had taken lessons for ten years . danced well but without any peculiar [female] , they believed that [female] had never had any opportunity to dance and with a mocking . malicious air , they now announced to her that it was her turn .
`` happy the thing which has had the honour of occupying your majesty 's mind , '' returned the ancient courtier , deeming it right to preserve honey upon his tongue . although bitter gall was in his heart , in consequence of the treatment to which he had just been exposed . the lord chamberlain drew himself up to his full height . bowed low , coughed , hemmed , and , after repeating this process several times .
here was news indeed , [female] 's breath came thick and fast . and with [female] fingers she drew some of the nuts out of her pocket . and began rolling them carelessly towards the child , apparently he did not get nuts very often . for he dropped his little wand at once , and stretched out his tiny hands to pick them up . this was just what she wanted ; and she slipped down from her seat to the ground .
so the man went , and when he got there the whole palace was made of polished marble with alabaster figures and golden ornaments . and soldiers were marching before the door blowing trumpets . and beating cymbals and drums ; and in the house . barons , and counts , and dukes were going about as servants . then they opened the doors to him .
both youths joked happily together , as the peasant sewed away with diligent fingers . and when they had no more words to say , the shepherd lifted his young quavering voice and sang long drawn ditties . which ever had a mournful ring in their notes , full of melancholy and patient longing . after a while the last stitch had been put , and the kindly youth held up the velvet coat in triumph . so that the sun shone upon it making it look quite new .
at first the gypsy did not seem to know where that mocking song came from . but when she discovered that it was her prisoner . the old parrot , who was thus daring to imitate her , she stood silent and glared at him . and her face was almost white with rage , when he came to the end of the verse he pretended to burst into a violent fit of sobbing and crying . and screeched out to his wife , mate , mate ! hand up my handkerchief , oh , oh !
and the pitch remained sticking to her fast , and never , as long as she lived . could it be got off , there was once a sweet little maid , much beloved by everybody . but most of all by her grandmother , who never knew how to make enough of her . once she sent her a little cap of red velvet . and as it was very becoming to her , and she never wore anything else .
but when the woman heard that , and found that the man did not at all know either when their son would be out of his apprentice ship . or where he had gone , she packed him off again to find out . and gave him a bag of food and a roll of tobacco to take away with him . when he had walked for some time he came to a great wood . and it stretched before him all day long as he went on .
the girl ran home to her mother . who met her at the door , `` well , daughter , '' she said , impatient to hear her speak . when she opened her mouth . to the mother 's horror , two vipers and two toads sprang from it .
as she spoke the rising wind wailed about the palace and died away . dull thunder reverberated in the distance , the air grew stifling . and the night flowers paid their perfumes out like threatened debtors . another rush of wind , then silence broken only by a peal of thunder nearer than before . the splash of heavy drops was heard on the flagstones of the courtyard below .
a peasant , named [female] , who lived in rodenkirchen . found one time a glass shoe on one of the hills where the little people used to dance . he clapped it instantly into his pocket and ran away with it . keeping his hand as close on his pocket as if he had a dove in it . for he knew that he had found a treasure which the underground people must redeem at any price .
now the woman saw she would gain nothing by being sulky . so she pretended to be very glad to have got rid of her husband ; but all the while she was trying to invent a plan to deliver herself from the turtle . at length she remembered that one of her friends had a large iron pot . and when the turtle had gone to his room to put away his fringes . she ran over to her neighbour 's and brought it back .
streamlets of water trickled here and there , forming great pools which made walking exceedingly difficult . [male] , whose mind was a very acute and intelligent one , became terrified at these alarming symptoms of danger . especially as the ice began to crack , and loud and prolonged reports reached them from every direction . another most suspicious thing was the sudden disappearance of the company of merchants . whom they had all along kept well in sight , there was something wrong .
it was customary for gentlemen of all classes . whether sportsmen or not , to possess birds of some kind . `` to keep up their rank , '' as the saying then was , only the richest nobles . however , were expected to keep a regular falconry , that is , a collection of birds suited for taking all kinds of game . such as the [person] , the kite , the heron .
`` i hear the sound of horses '' feet behind us , again said [male] . the prince put his ear to the earth and said . `` yes , they are nearly upon us , '' thereupon [female] changed herself . the prince and the horse , all into a dense forest in which many paths crossed .
even mr. [male] did not provide a bigger feast when he married mrs. [female] . for there were also all the best sorts of sweets in the world . sugar candy on a string , and twisted barley sticks , and bulls' eyes . and peardrops , and licorice shoe strings , and turkish delight . and pink and white sugar mice .
he could not know that her father , the king . had invited the astrologers and wise men to cure his daughter of her malady . the reward of success being her hand and half his kingdom . the punishment of failure the forfeiture of life . nay , he might even have rejoiced to know that already forty heads , relieved of wisdom .
the old temple , so long given over to silence and solitude was filled with countless sights and sounds of life . the innkeepers turned the subterranean vaults into cellars and nailed on the old pillars signs surmounted by the figure of the holy [male] . and bearing this inscription in greek and egyptian -- pomegranate wine , fig wine . and genuine cilician beer sold here , on the walls , sculptured with pure and graceful carvings . the shop keepers hung ropes of onions .
fruits and flowers , shaped out of jewels . whose beauty and fragrance was like that of the flowers of [male] . [male] 's astonishment and delight knew no bounds . the hours went by too quickly , and when the stars began to pale the dwarf led him back to his room in the tower . and every night at midnight the same dwarf brought him back to the enchanted kingdom .
`` you shall have that because you have been so industrious , '' said mother [female] . and at the same time she gave her back the shuttle which she had let fall into the well . thereupon the door closed , and the [female] found herself up above upon the earth . not far from her mother 's house , so she went in to her mother . and as she arrived thus covered with gold , she was well received .
with this she took the pot from the fire . put on her bonnet , and they went out together . as they passed the children , they stopped to play with them a while . for they now felt almost like children themselves . then they trudged on through the snow till they came to a clump of trees .
then he told them the whole story . and , when he had finished , pulled off the kerchief , and showed his bald pate . `` what a capital joke , '' shouted his listeners . and amid roars of laughter , claimed the bet of fish , and wine . it was duly paid ; but [male] never allowed his hair to grow again .

'' and they pushed the pretended poor man away . and took the necklace off his neck , and said to him . get out of the way , you poor , dirty man . your clothes are far too dirty for you to come near us !
and even as he spoke came the renewed cry of attack . and the answering shout of [male] , [male] ! from the defenders upon the walls , then all leapt up , over turning the council board . and ran out to the battlements to carry on with what courage was left to them a hopeless contest for one more day . little duke [male] remained like a beating heart in the great empty keep .
she told [female] that after the first two months . the demons came to her no more , until she was left wholly alone ; then they renewed their visits . but not continuously , and she felt less fear , [female] also records of her this touching confession . that when the time came for her to embark , in the breton ship . for home , there came over her a strong impulse to refuse the embarkation .

the ascent was excessively difficult , i mounted , with great pain . to a point so high that i no longer dared look below ; i fixed my eyes on each crevice and cranny as they appeared above me . and tried to think of nothing but my next step upward , i was nearing the top . i looked up , and saw directly overhead a great bowlder which projected from the face of the cliff . evidently at its very summit , this was the bowlder of which the sorcerer had spoken as the abode of the great horned owl .
a young damsel with a bright red cap on her head . and armed with pistols , it was the little robber [female] . who , tired of being at home , had determined to make a journey to the north . and afterwards in another direction , if that did not please her . she recognised [female] immediately , and [female] knew her too .
all zest of having won was wiped out and gone , he only felt an aching longing for the little companion who had abandoned him in the hour of attainment . was this for ever the way of the weary earth ? were all victories so sad ? he had also an unceasing desire for the voice of his old friend the hermit . knowing that he would have been able to explain what was but dark mystery to his searching mind . he had the sensation of being completely forsaken and useless , a weary , weary stranger who had no home in this world .

'' cut your coat according to your cloth , is an old maxim and a wise one . and if people will only square their ideas according to their circumstances .
after this explanation , despair took the place of hope and of joy . the daughters seeing all their projects annihilated by this [male] . uttered fearful cries ; the brothers , more courageous , said resolutely that they would not suffer their father to return to this frightful castle . that they were bold enough to deliver the earth from this horrible beast . even supposing he should have the temerity to come in search of him .
then the princess dallied with him , giving ear to his tales of terror and triumph . but , when he had supped and fallen asleep , she stole out and told the prince all about it . and he , bidding his wife farewell . rode off in haste to tell his brothers in law . when they heard his news they called up their forces .
the sound crept along the waters , and the steeds . so ferocious a moment before , became perfectly still , they had no longer any motion of their own . and they floated on the top of the tide like foam before a breeze . `` now , '' said the fairy , as he led the dwarf 's horse to the edge of the tide . the dwarf urged the horse into the water .
the king gazed and the queen gazed , both half risen from their thrones . and looking as if about to tumble down upon her , if only they could be right sure that the ragged girl was their own child . a mistake would be such a dreadful thing , `` my darling !

the fish had no sooner finished these words . than the black threw the pan into the middle of the closet . and reduced these fishes to a coal , having done this , he retired fiercely . and entering again into the hole of the wall , it shut . and appeared just as it was before , after what i have seen , says the sultan to the vizier .
here the argives , being short of water , halted on the outskirts of a forest in order to search for a spring . when they saw a majestic and beautiful woman seated on the trunk of a tree . nursing an infant , they concluded from her noble and queenly appearance that she must be a goddess . but were informed by her that she was [female] , queen of the lemnians . who had been carried away captive by pirates , and sold as a slave to king [female] .
after eight months had elapsed the young prince had to go to war again . and , with a heavy heart , took leave of his dear pretty wife . as -- if one is obliged to tell it -- she was enceinte , but the prince had to go . and he went , consoling his wife , who wept bitterly , that he would return soon . the young king left orders that as soon as his wife was confined a confidential messenger was to be sent without delay to inform him of the event .
so that was the doleful noise she had been hearing , up in the little pine trees ?

next day she went again to the chase . and the jackal ate up another little panther , so now there were only eight . in the evening , when she came back , the panther said . `` jackal , bring out my little ones , '' and the jackal brought out first one and then another . and the last one he brought out three times .
`` not a bit of it , mother . look here !

they told [location] that , during the passage upwards . it often happened that one or another , from pure wantonness , stepped quite out of the tun . and sat himself between the loose stones on the projecting piece of rock . whilst they fired and blasted the rock below so that it shook again . and the stones about him thundered down , should one expostulate with him on his fool hardiness .
now their owner had a daughter who , when people came to call . used to say , `` you would reelly oughter see them peacocks on the mall .

so she laid herself down in the sun and winked with one eye . she had a very comfortable place and felt so at ease that she fell asleep . the little singing bird busied himself for some time with his broken wing . and at last he too lay down , quite close to his protectress , the sun shone warm and bright . and he found it a very good place .
by chance she was seated next to the kind fairy [female] . and as the mouth is prompt to speak about that of which the heart is full . she related to the latter all the trouble she had had in providing suitably for the fourteen princes . during which narration she did not fail to give it well to the king and queen . just as if they were present , at last she asked her colleague if she happened to have a kingdom or a princess to bestow on prince [male] .
in [female] and galway , the favorite amusement of the leprechawn is riding a sheep or goat . or even a dog , when the other animals are not available , and if the sheep look weary in the morning or the dog is muddy and worn out with fatigue . the peasant understands that the local leprechawn has been going on some errand that lay at a greater distance than he cared to travel on foot . aside from riding the sheep and dogs almost to death . the leprechawn is credited with much small mischief about the house .
you can not do me a greater favour than to inform me of the destiny of my dear [female] . when you hear any news of it . the uncertainty i am in concerning her fate . and the apprehensions which her fainting occasioned me . keep me in this languishing condition you reproach me with .

there was a boy named [male] who was the only son of a widow . he was so devoted and obedient that other people in the village used to be saying always . `` what a good son [male] is ; how kind he is to his mother . '' so , while he was the example for all the other boys in the village . he was the pride of his mother .
[male] , my son ! ', she screamed . `` here is gold yellow as a pumpkin , where have you been to gather such wealth ? '' she shook him and gave him no peace until he waked fully and told the story . even then his mother did not believe it , but threw up her hands and wept that her son should thus rave with fever . the woodcutter and [female] came running to see what had happened , and at the sight of the second bag of gold the poor woman grew calmer .
she crossed the room , quiet as any mouse . and reached the toilet table , there lay the king 's gold comb . and close to it the little [male] knife . the king 's wedding gift to his queen . back tripped [female] , still on tiptoe , to the ante room .
this said , he presented them with the keys of the castle . and proceeded on his journey to wales , then , getting out of bed . and feeling about the room in the dark , he found a thick billet of wood . and laid it in the bed in his stead . then he hid himself in a dark corner of the room .
as prince [male] , after he had obtained the fairy [male] banou 's leave to go to the sultan of the indies court , never failed once a month , and the magician knew the time . she went a day or two before to the foot of the rock where she had lost sight of the prince and his attendants . and waited there with a plan she had formed , the next morning prince [male] went out as usual at the iron gate with the same attendants as before . and passed by the magician , whom he knew not to be such , seeing her lie with her head on the rock .
florimel sank upon one knee before her , and kissed the pink finger tips of the dainty hand she extended to him . then came in the greatest excitement all the fairies and brownies . for these latter little people when [male] left them had followed close upon his heels to aid him if need be . since , in spite of mystic power that had temporarily passed with night . they were too brave to desert a comrade when danger threatened .
but she was not listening , she had gone ; and he smilingly followed . the sound of music gradually died away , there was a distant [male] of voices . then again the music sounded , louder , with a quality of triumph in it . louder and louder it sounded , the bridal party returned ! flower girls ran before , scattering flowers .
the grand vizier agreed to the proposal of his ruler , and undertook himself to convey to the astounded [male] the tidings that the commander of the faithful had given him a palace and awaited his visit . the same evening the new favourite of the [male] packed all his few belongings on the horse 's back . took the iron casket under his arm and . amid the cheers of the crowd , entered the palace . a troop of negroes received him and threw themselves at his feet .
there all was silent and deserted , there was no sound nor movement except among the leaves overhead . the boys called aloud , but there was no answer . beside the door still lay the game that their father had brought . and to satisfy their hunger the older brother cut some pieces from it and cooked them at the fire . when night came they crept into a corner of the lodge and began to weep .

now when the fairies , that work down underground , heard that the dutch had learned the use of money . and had even built a mint to stamp the metal , they held a feast to talk over what they should do to help or harm . in any event , they wanted to have some fun with the mortals above ground . that has always been the way with kabouters , they are in for fun . first , last , and always , so , with punches and hammers , they made counterfeit money .
the woman did not wait for him to change his mind . she caught him up by his shell and popped him straight into the pot . where he sank to the bottom , and died instantly , once upon a time there lived a poor knight who had a great many children . and found it very hard to get enough for them to eat , one day he sent his eldest son .

her stepmother had money and she put this poor child in a cheap lodgin' house tellin her to find a job , and she herself went calmly off travelin ' . this poor lamb tried one place after another , but her beauty always stood in her way . i am ashamed to speak of such things to you , [female] , but i have got to . to make you understand , she said she wondered if there were any good men in this world .
silently the young man listened to the sultan 's words . and silently he sat in his mother 's kitchen for many days to come . till , one morning , the news reached him that the sultan had betrothed his daughter to the son of the wizir . and that the wedding was to be celebrated without delay in the palace . with that he arose in wrath , and made his way quickly and secretly to a side door .
awaking from my sleep , i sprang up , and did as the voice had directed . i shot at the horseman , and he fell into the sea . and the bow having fallen from my hand , i buried it . the sea then became troubled , and rose to the summit of the mountain . and when i had stood waiting there a little while , i beheld a boat in the midst of the sea , approaching me .

[male] was terribly frightened , the tail came further and further in , and [male] grew more and more alarmed . at last the [male] shook itself and leaned further back , so that the whole tail entered and touched [male] 's nose .
so he consulted with the young king over the best way to bring this about . and they agreed their plan should be put in effect the next day . the sultan then rested , and the young king gave himself up to happy hopes of release . the next day the sultan arose . and then went to the palace in the garden where the black slave was .
take the meat off the horse , then the old woman laughed . for her heart was glad , but when she went to take the meat from the horse 's back . he snorted and jumped about , and acted like a wild horse , the old woman looked at him in wonder . and could hardly believe that it was the same horse , so the boy had to take off the meat . for the horse would not let the old woman come near him .

the youth fished him up and cut off his head . then he changed back to his own form , he went to the dragon man 's lodge to see how the old woman had fared . but she had gone with her bright robe , and the lodge was empty . then the youth went back to his home and reported what he had done . and he received many rich gifts from the chief for his brave deed .
as soon as they were gone , the traveling musicians sat down at the table . they ate all that the robbers had left , and as they were very hungry . they ate very fast , then , when they had cleared the table . they put out the lights , and each found a place in which to sleep . the ass lay upon a heap of straw in the yard .

over the low wall clambered the children , to find to their delight that the [female] was in the lane before them . just a little way ahead , but now she took to flying higher and faster than she had yet done . to keep up with her at all they had to run , and even with this they sometimes lost sight of her altogether for a minute or two . but they kept up bravely -- they were too eager and excited to waste breath by speaking . the race lasted for some minutes , till at last .

it may be generally summed up , of this inferior people , that they have no idea of anything . of a great institution like smithfield , they are unable to form the least conception . a beast market in the heart of [location] would be regarded an impossible nuisance . nor have they any notion of slaughter houses in the midst of a city . one of these benighted frog eaters would scarcely understand your meaning , if you told him of the existence of such a british bulwark .

the young [female] made desperate attempts to get himself through the narrow opening in the hollow tree . he screamed when he failed to get through , his foster parents had remained so long beside him that they were wasted and sad while the other birds . their broods reared , were vigorous and joyful , they heard the one that had been reared in their nest . the young [male] , scream , but this time they did not fly towards him . the young [male] screamed again , but there was something in that scream that reminded the foster parents of hawks .

a moment later he stood by the shed and was just going to shut the door . when he heard a rustling within , the boy . who had watched his opportunity , had run directly to the shed , where he left the animals . but they were no longer out in the rain : a strong wind had long since thrown open the door and helped them to get a roof over their heads . the patter which the master heard was occasioned by the boy running into the shed .
upon which he began to weep , the great knife fell out of his hand . and he went into the back yard , and killed a little lamb . and dressed it with such good sauce , that his [male] assured him she had never eaten anything so good in her life . he had at the same time taken up little [female] . and carried her to his wife , to conceal her in the lodging he had at the end of the court yard .

thus the two children grew up together , and loved each other dearly , dearly . but the boy 's mother was really a wicked witch woman . and so jealous that she wanted all the boy 's love for herself . and when the girl baby grew white as milk , with cheeks like roses and lips like cherries . and when her hair , shining like golden silk , hung down to her feet so that her father and all the neighbours began to praise her looks . the stepmother fairly hated her , and did all in her power to spoil her looks .

by order of the court , horrible instruments were brought forward which chilled the blood of [male] in his veins . but to his surprise , when he looked round to see if none would be his friend . he noticed that every one , from the judge to the herald . was shaking with laughter , his amazement was increased when with a [male] voice one of the women demanded that the bodies should be produced . so that the judge might be induced to feel more pity and to order more tortures .

'' they said , and that is exactly what you would have said under the same circumstances . then they pulled it to land and tried to open it . it was not very difficult and they soon succeeded , they took a handful each of the contents of the casket . and , burying the casket in the sand , went home , she had . it was the laughter of the mermaid .
for within was sunlight , the beaming sunlight of a child 's two eyes . and the tones of the spring birds sounded in the words that came from the child 's rosy lips . she sat on ib 's knee . and ib was to her both father and mother . for her own parents were dead , and had vanished from her as a dream vanishes alike from children and grown men .
before morning she had made the entire circuit of the lake . muttering fearful words as she crossed every stream . and casting into it some of the water out of her bottle . when she had finished the circuit she muttered yet again . and flung a handful of water towards the moon .
one by one all the little people got up on their legs again , and the rest of the day was passed in merriment and feasting . on the morrow the wedding of prince [male] and his fair bride was celebrated with the grandest solemnities . after which the two peoples took leave of one another in the most friendly manner . the root mannikins returned to their own valley , and the puppet folks remained on the nutfield . it took prince [male] a full week to put his state in order .
as it came nearer , he knew what it was . for skimming swiftly along the waters came a monster dragon with nine heads . then the prince took counsel with his beasts . and as the dragon approached the shore the fox drew his brush through the water and blinded the dragon by scattering the salt water in his eyes . while the bear and the lion threw up more water with their paws .
you see how bewildered parents must be by their love for their children . to be so merciful towards them , as a cat carrying her young in her mouth screens it from the sun at one time and brings it under the light at another . so parents act by their children . screening their bad points and bringing out in relief their good qualities . they care neither for the abuse of others .
many of the mediaval romances were , of course . translated into hungarian ; and even to this day the penny bookstall is always present at fairs and popular gatherings where `` yards of literature '' are to be obtained for a nominal sum , the vendor can not afford a booth or stall . so a mat or tarpaulin is spread on the ground . and weighted at the four corners with brickbats or paving stones .
all this was talked about in the kitchen , and when [male] heard how the prince was pining away for love of the beautiful stranger she made up her mind that it was time for her to make herself known . therefore one day when the other servants were not looking she made a little cake . and in it she hid the magic ring that the prince had tried upon his finger that last night of the carnival . then she caused word to be carried to the queen mother 's ears that it was said by an old woman in the kitchen that she could cure the prince if they would only let her try . at first the queen mother paid no attention to this talk but as day after day passed and her son grew no better .
the friends of a beheaded person take his body home from the scene of death . it remains one day sitting in the dwelling . sometimes a head is bought back from the victors at the end of a day . the usual price paid being a carabao , after the body has remained one day in the dwelling it is said to be buried without ceremony near the trail leading to the pueblo which took the head . the following day the entire [male] has a ceremonial fishing in the river .
the prince went at once to his father , told him the whole story . and obtained a ship and men to journey to cornwall and rescue the princess . then , with hereward by his side , he set sail . and soon landed in cornwall , hoping to obtain his bride peaceably , to his grief he learnt that the princess had just been betrothed to a wild cornish leader . [male] , and the wedding feast was to be held that very day .
this strange voice so frightened the queen that she took the letter and went away hastily with [female] . and they held a council to try and devise some means of finding out what fairy or enchanter was favouring the princess . at last they sent one of the queen 's maids to wait [female] . and told her to pretend to be quite stupid , and to see and hear nothing . while she was really to watch the princess day and night .
the king declared that if all the corn was not in the barn by the morning he would hang him . the lad wept and wailed for a long time , when suddenly he remembered his whistles . and blew into the one that the mouse had given him and when the mice came he told them his misfortunes . by midnight all the corn of the country was gathered together . next day his brothers were more angry still , and falsely said to the king that their brother was able to build a beautiful bridge of wax from the royal castle to the market place in one night .
another motor cycle now sped into the driveway and approached , this time it was the tenant carder had expected . and [female] left the office and went back to the house . at the moment when she stepped out of the yellow building . [female] ceased mowing the grass , looking back when she had traversed half the distance . she saw that he was following her .
once on a time there was a king who had an only daughter . he was so proud and so fond of her . that he was in constant terror that something would happen to her if she went outside the palace . and thus , owing to his great love for her , he forced her to lead the life of a prisoner . shut up within her own rooms , so the princess did as the witch advised her .
and to that it will come ; for hereafter is long -- longer than this story . there was once a regular student : he lived in a garret . and nothing at all belonged to him ; but there was also once a regular huckster . he lived on the ground floor . and the whole house was his ; and the goblin kept with him .
that night as he lay awake in his closet coughing . feverish and restless , he heard his master and [male] moving about till very late . evidently packing for [location] or [male] , and [male] wondered if he would like either place better than nice . and wished they were not so far from valrose , in the midst of his meditations he fell asleep . and when he woke , it was morning .
at this moment the fairy [female] appeared in all her glory . she was seated in a massive chariot of gold . drawn by a hundred and fifty larks , she was clothed with a robe of butterflies wings , of the most brilliant colors while from her shoulders fell a mantle of network of diamonds . which trailed ten feet behind her and it was so fine in texture that it was light as gauze .
almost a year had gone by , when , one day , as she wandered about further from home than usual . she heard some one moaning , and going towards the spot from whence the sound came . she saw a man tied to a tree . his face all swollen and looking full of agony , `` poor man , '' said tender hearted [female] , and she soon brought him some water in her hat from the stream near by .
for many heavy days and dark nights the heart must suffer to enable it to endure trial and temptation . yet , amidst it all , would the minstrel sing . dark days and cold nights also passed over the old bell . and it noticed them not ; but the bell in the man 's heart felt it to be a gloomy time . what would become of this young man , and what would become of the old bell ?
alla ad deen rose early the next morning . dressed himself , to be ready when his uncle called on him . and after he had waited some time , began to be impatient , and stood watching at the door . but as soon as he perceived him coming , he told his mother . took his leave of her , and ran to meet him .
gregory of tours states that [female] revived the ancient games of the circus . but that [female] had ceased to be famous for good athletes and race horses . although animal combats continued to take place for the amusement of the kings . one day king [male] halted . with the principal officers of his army , at the abbey of ferrieres .
to this the prince agreed , and they consulted together over a plan by which she might be able to make her escape and return with him into persia . and as the first step , she was to dress herself with care . and receive the sultan with civility when he visited her next morning . the sultan was transported with delight on learning the result of the interview . and his opinion of the doctor 's skill was raised still higher when .
the poor men only gaped with astonishment at this explanation . however the marriage they had arranged duly took place . but the fact was that the bride was entirely ignorant of how to clean and spin cotton . it was not long before this was found out , for , in the spring . when there was no work in the fields , her father in law set all the women of the household to spinning cotton .
`` oh , you darling , '' sang the blackbird ; and golden hair laughed with glee . for she liked to be loved , as to the butterflies , they flew after her . and rested on her hair , and tickled her cheeks . but she never tried to catch them , then golden hair went upstairs . and there she saw three beds all in a row .
as soon as the servant was gone , [male] escaped from his prison and went to the harbour to forget his sorrow . there some drunken people seized and carried him on board a ship . and the merchants on it asked him of what condition he was . [male] told them that he was of the poor class . and that his mother got her living by washing linen for strangers .
as he approached [male] 's castle . he found the road strewed with the bones and carcases of those whom he had devoured or torn to pieces . and presently the giant emerged from a wood , when , seeing [male] with his sword drawn . he ran at him with his iron club . and would have killed him on the spot , had not a crow come and pecked at his eyes .
but no sooner was he slain than he again took his own shape . and [male] knew that [male] was still alive in the quicken tree , then nine times did a man of [male] 's army climb the tree . and nine times was he thrown to earth and killed by his own friends . for each time did [male] cause the warrior to take [male] 's shape . when [male] saw nine of his men lie dead before him his heart failed him .
with these words [male] led the way into the forest behind the shepherd 's cottage . and [male] followed him with the utmost confidence . being quite sure that he meant to help her if he could . and here we must leave our little princess for a time . in order to return to another individual in whom we ought to be equally interested .
even today , within the beautiful city , the forests . with their grand old trees , still remain , and the fish pond , called the vijver . is there yet , with its swans , on the little island , the fluffy . downy cygnets are born and grow to be big birds , with long necks . bent like an arch , in another part of the town .
orders were given for the guests to take their seats . ninety six tables were ranged in eight rows , in front of them . on a large platform covered with velvet , with a canopy in the middle . was a table larger than the rest , and loaded with fruit and flowers . to say nothing of the roast hares .
as [female] 's troubled soul had derived so much benefit from the short pilgrimage to altotting . she hoped to obtain far more from a visit to santiago di compostella . famed throughout christendom , in santiago di compostella both her means and her strength were exhausted . after vainly expecting for a long time some token of the saint 's helpful kindness . only two courses were left : either she must remain in compostella and join the beggars in the crowded road to the place of pilgrimage .
latterly she shut herself up pretty nearly altogether in her room . she had an old , rather [female] , irish servant woman in attendance upon her . this domestic was tall , lean , and religious , and the captain knew instinctively she hated him . and he hated her in return . often threatened to put her out of the house , and sometimes even to kick her out of the window .
not far from the city , a promontory projected into the sea . thither the maidens were anxious to go , in order to see the sun sink into the water . having rowed thither , they beheld a boat occupied by armed men . anticipating no good , my brother commanded the oarsmen to turn the vessel . and make for land , his apprehensions seemed , indeed , to be confirmed , for the boat quickly approached that of my brother .
in the meanwhile , the king did not forget the lovely children . and reproached them for never going to the palace , they excused themselves by saying that their brother 's absence prevented them . prince [male] at break of day perceived a handsome young man . from whom he learned where the singing apple was to be found : but after travelling some time without seeing any sign of it . he saw a poor turtle dove fall at his feet almost dead .
the water sprite bowed , and dancing over the dewy grass to the river . threw herself into it , sometimes she swam beneath the clear water . sometimes she rose partly in the air , where she seemed like a little cloud of sparkling mist borne onward by the wind . and sometimes she floated upon the surface , her pale blue robes undulating with the [female] waves . while her white hands and feet shone in the sun like tiny crests of foam .
well , she did marry him , and sure enough he did feel like a prince . what prince , i would like to know , had a lovelier bride , none ! and was there any prince in the world whose bride brought him greater riches than the golden apple tree . the golden horse , and golden cradle ? no , not one , and furthermore the farmer promised that . when he died , he would leave him the magic grape vine .
but a quivering in her sweet upper lip made her look as if she were going to cry . what was the most strange was that away from her head streamed out her black hair in every direction . so that the darkness in the hay loft looked as if it were made of her . hair but as diamond gazed at her in speechless amazement . mingled with confidence -- for the boy was entranced with her mighty beauty .
then the fianna gave a roar of exultation . and each man seized his neighbour and kissed him on both cheeks . and they gripped hands about [male] . and they danced round and round in a great circle . roaring with laughter and relief , in the ecstasy which only comes where grisly fear has been and whence that bony jowl has taken itself away .
so all the princes and knights were bidden to present themselves before the king that night . so that he who had ridden so far up the glass hill might show the golden apple which the king 's daughter had thrown down . but no one had anything to show , one knight presented himself after the other . and none could show the apple , at night . too , [male] 's brothers came home again and had a long story to tell about riding up the glass hill .
when the wicked queen saw this , she rubbed [female] 's face with walnut juice . so that she was quite brown ; then she tangled her beautiful hair and smeared it with disgusting ointment until it was quite impossible to recognize her . she had been in the wood only a short time when night came on and she quite lost the path . so she laid herself down on the soft moss . offered up her evening prayer , and leaned her head against the stump of a tree .
i have been asked to introduce miss [female] to the [location] public . and although i believe that introductions of this kind often do more harm than good . i have consented in this case because the instance is rare enough to justify an exception . if miss [female] had been a promising young novelist either of the realistic or the romantic school . i should not have dared to express an opinion on her work .
on a sudden they heard loud rapping , which became still louder , and then a harsh voice crying out in angry tones . again and yet again , it was as she said : the wizard . in the cave hall , was grey with rage . never before had he called to his servants without their scurrying on [male] feet to learn his desires . but this time he had struck repeatedly upon the arm of his chair .
while he was in this sore plight a little door in the castle gate opened . and he could see a street facing him . with tall houses , then a [male] with curling hair of gold looked through the little door and bade [female] open the gate . upon that she went away from [female] , and when the men came out from the castle to seek him and did not find him they were sorely grieved . and they returned to the castle , then [male] went to the [male] and placed his hand on her shoulder .
in the [female] collection at south kensington museum . there are two carved ivory chairs and a table . the latter gilded , the former partly gilded , which are a portion of a set taken from tippo sahib at the storming of seringapatam .

at last the eldest said , `` be quick , my sisters , our partners will be impatient .

the atlanteans had also sea going vessels which were propelled by some power analogous to that above mentioned . but the current force which was eventually found to be most effective in this case had a denser appearance than that used in the air boats . with regard to marriage and the relations of the sexes the experiments made by the turanians have already been referred to . polygamous customs were prevalent at different times among all the sub races . but in the toltec days while two wives were allowed by the law .
instead , he lingered about the cottage until night fell and played all manner of tricks to bring [male] running out . he blew soot down the chimney and blackened the clean scrubbed kitchen floor . he put out her candle when she had lighted it for evening . and whisked her linen from the hedges into the fields and far away . not one word of anger or reproach would [female] utter , even so .
[female] , thinking she heard footsteps . got up and ran into the room where her daughters lay dead , at the dreadful sight she gnashed her teeth . barked like a dog , tore out her hair by handfuls . and seating herself in her trough as in a car . set off after the fugitives , she had nearly reached them .
they , of course , were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey . and all with one voice agreed to what the ronin had proposed ; and so the matter was settled . when , at length , they reached the shore . they left the boat , and every man went his way . but the ronin , overjoyed in his heart , took the wandering priest 's luggage .
at midnight the men came creeping along ; one stopped outside , and the other went in . presently he handed a basket of silver out . and went back for the money , just as he came creeping along with the box . cocky gave a loud , long crow , that frightened the robbers and woke the boys . the man with the basket ran away in such a hurry that he tumbled into a well .
the prince could not understand what his father said , and as he was blind . attacked the king furiously , the king made a violent cut back at him . and in ten minutes they were in the thick of an awful fight . which ended in both being mortally wounded at exactly the same moment , seeing them fall . their attendants , who hated the wicked tyrants , made haste to tie them hands and feet .

a lyre which played itself ; a flask containing a draught which should keep the princess young . a vial of colours which hardly anyone ever sees . flowers and grasses and leaves which could be used almost like a dictionary to spell out other things . an assortment of wonderful happy fancies of every variety . a new rainbow ; a box of picture cards of the world .
as his eye took in the frightening spectacle he realized that there was not a moment to lose . quick as a flash he whipped an arrow from his quiver and placed it to the bow . he aimed the arrow straight at the human octopus . and back to its greatest tension pulled the cord , once again the cord proved true . and the speeding arrow cleft the human octopus in twain .
we were discussing the new appointment of a government curator at the mabgwe ruins . i approved it , the bar tender did not . i pleaded that he was a bit exacting , that the curator had a very cold scent to puzzle out . and that he had tried plodding about from ruins to ruins . moling and sapping and mining , not to speak of writing to [organization] afterwards i shouldered my knapsack .
an elegant repast was ready in the dining room , to which they adjourned . here they were again astonished by the grandeur of the apartment and the elegance of the entertainment . and they felt so happy , that the evening passed away before they were aware . next day , after they had finished breakfast . the ladies proceeded to examine the pictures and furniture of the rooms that were open .
a rapid current carries the ship along with it , and we shall all perish in less than a quarter of an hour . pray to god to deliver [location] from this peril . we can not escape , if he do not take pity on us . at these words he ordered the sails to be lowered . but all the ropes broke , and the ship was carried by the current to the foot of an inaccessible mountain .
at length , with an appearance of great anxiety . the lad , accompanied by the exciseman , returned to the spot from which they started . where writhing in the agonies of death , from the blow the former had instinctively . but almost unconsciously , given it , lay the snake or nathair . it was only now that the gauger began to comprehend what had happened to his guide .
the seal catcher did as he was bid . and when he found himself safe on the ground . he peeped cautiously over the edge of the cliff . to see if there were any seals lying on the rocks below , to his astonishment he saw no rocks . only the blue sea , which came right up to the foot of the cliff .
in the middle of the enclosure or court was a staff bearing the emblem of the god . this type of shrine and open court was kept up always . and is like the jewish type , we find stone used for the doors in the sixth dynasty . and stone built temples in the twelfth dynasty . the earlier type of temple was essentially a resting place for the god between the excursions of the festivals .
where the old hut had stood was the prettiest little cottage you ever saw . with the very [female] , and [female] , and wild roses violet had planted trained over it . and there was [male] 's garden all in order . just as they had left it ; and under the great elm tree there was his grave . with a new white stone at the head , and the old man 's name and age cut in it .
as a rule the black or drain rats feed only in the night . very rarely in the day , as they are of a dirty nature . and prefer being in the drains , in my opinion the black rat is more vicious than the brown . there is another rat i call the red rat . which is akin to the brown rat , you will always catch these at a tannery .

as luck would have it , brown catches a ball in the seat of his pants . causing a bloody and inconvenient wound about an eighth of an inch deep . this is the closest thing to a happy ending in the book , this reviewer 's recommendation . read the review , skip the book , if you live in an age of political incorrectness . you may as well take advantage of it .

howlin wid rage among the weird legends of the irish peasantry is found a class of stories peculiar both in the nature of the subject and in the character of the tradition . from the dawn of history , and even before , the island has been crowded with inhabitants . and as the centres of population changed , towns and cities were deserted and fell into ruins . although no longer inhabited , their sites are by no means unknown or forgotten , but in many localities where now appear only irregular heaps of earth and stones to which the archaologist sometimes finds difficulty in attributing an artificial origin there linger among the common people tales of the city that once stood on the spot .

and the rock he was , and gloried in his power . proudly he stood , and neither the heat of the sun nor the force of the rain could move him . `` this is better than all , '' he said to himself , but one day he heard a strange noise at his feet . and when he looked down to see what it could be , he saw a stone cutter driving tools into his surface . even while he looked a [male] feeling ran all through him .

the children laughed and chattered and kicked the gold pieces this way and that into the green bushes . then they brought the old man into the hut and gave him a bowl of kasha to eat . because he had had no dinner , there was no magic about the kasha . but it was good enough kasha for all that , and hunger made it better . when the old man had finished the kasha and drunk a glass of tea and smoked a little pipe .
there was nothing for it but to try to climb as far up the cliffs as possible . and trust that the tide would turn back before it reached them . with the help of the old beggar , they perched themselves upon the highest shelf to which . on that almost perpendicular wall of rock , they could hope to attain . but , nevertheless , as the waves leaped white beneath , it seemed very far indeed from safety .

this made the turtle so angry that he could no longer keep silence . he started to say , soup , you shall be made into soup yourselves . miserable children , but as he opened his mouth to utter the first word . he let go of the stick and crashed down into the courtyard of the palace . where the king and a number of his courtiers were walking .
the name glittered in gas jets over the entrance . it was `` mabille , '' the soaring upwards of rockets . the splashing of fountains , and the popping of champagne corks accompanied the wild bacchantic dance . over the whole glided the moon through the air . clear , but with a somewhat crooked face , the moon shone bright .
after a while there came into these parts a certain knight . [male] by name , so called because he was the son of a prince among the satyrs . but his mother was of the race of men . he was brought up in the woods , far from all human company . nor did he learn letters or any craft whatsoever .
`` stop laughing , i say , '' he roared in a threatening tone . the mouth then ceased laughing , but put out its tongue as far as it would go . [male] , not to spoil his handiwork , pretended not to see , and continued his labors . after the mouth he fashioned the chin . then the throat , and then the shoulders , the stomach .
and when you have seen lady [female] , you will be more deeply impressed . i am sure , we can hardly expect her to call upon you . this illness of miss [female] would prevent it . and in any case it would be an act of extreme condescension on her part . but i am quite confident that you will receive an invitation to drink tea of a sunday evening with her .
thereupon the bear came up to her and served her , whilst she gave him the best of what belongeth to mankind . till he had made an end , when he sat down and rested . presently , he sprang to her and served her again ; and thus he did . till he had furnished half a score courses . and they both fell down in a swoon and abode without motion .
they sought for him far and near , but all in vain . and they were forced to recognise the power of the evil fairy . against which the queen had warned them on her death bed , the old king was much grieved when they brought him the news of his son 's disappearance . but as he could do nothing to free him from his fate . he gave himself up to an old age of grief and loneliness .
ann did not as a rule complain about the amount of work she had to do . instead , she was rather proud of being able to accomplish so much in a single day . to night , however , she was tired and all out of sorts . she felt , too , that her looks were all against her . curly hair and freckles , added to a diminutive figure .
it seemed to come nearer and roar louder . till the men heard it also and listened in silence . till , at length , they told [male] that he must not dare to sleep . it was a `` fohn , '' that violent storm wind which rushes from the mountain to the valley beneath . and in its fury snaps asunder the trunks of large trees as if they were but slender reeds .
the next morning [male] stripped himself in presence of his father . and after anointing himself with a certain ointment , he murmured some words . whereupon , to the inexpressible astonishment of the good old man . in the place of his son , a fine powerful horse suddenly appeared . which he immediately harnessed as his son had instructed him .
but she knew it ; she bowed her head over the [female] bloom . and sank exhausted on her couch , the little rose elf found her thus , and , stealing to her ear he whispered to her about the evening in the [male] arbor . about the rose 's fragrance , and the love which he . the little elf , had for her , she dreamed so sweetly , and while she dreamed . the beautiful angel of death conveyed her spirit away from this world .
i have already related how the queen persecuted the poor royal wolf with hunts and battues . so that he was the innocent cause of great trouble and inconvenience to the whole wolvine family . as great evil too befel the little birds , and in those days of tyranny . it was a great misfortune to be born either a thrush . a linnet , or a nightingale , in the neighbourhood of the castle .
round his neck there lay a heavy golden chain , and the little old bent sickle . which he cut grass with , and which hung in his waistband . had turned into a gorgeous scimetar , whose ivory hilt gleamed in the pale light like snow in moonlight . as he stood wondering , like a man in a dream . the other [female] waved her hand and bade him turn and see .
`` you keep dem , '' said the old italian , `` and you find you need dem by and by . '' then she rose , and pulling her cloak over the basket she took her staff in her other hand and hobbled down the pathway . [male] slipped the key into his pocket . and holding the shovel and the trap he ran down to the gate to open it for her . he stood looking after her as she went on down the street .
more fortifications , more soldiering and drumming . more basins of soup , more little loaves of bread . more bottles of wine , more caraffes of brandy . more time for refreshment , everything good . and everything ready , bright , unsubstantial looking , scenic sort of station , people waiting .
this modern world is a world where the wonderful is utterly commonplace . we are bred to show a quiet freedom from amazement . and why should we boggle at material mermaids , with dewars solidifying all sorts of impalpable things and marconi waves spreading everywhere ? to the buntings she was as matter of fact . as much a matter of authentic and reasonable motives and of sound solid sentimentality .
we returned to the palace towards the evening . and the giant arrived shortly after , we were forced to submit to seeing another of our comrades roasted . but at last we revenged ourselves on the brutish giant in the following manner . after he had finished his cursed supper , he lay down on his back . and fell asleep , as soon as we heard him snore , according to his custom .
he had hardly said the words before they were back in the sack again . from this time the man and his wife lived so happily together that it was a pleasure to see them . and so the story has an end , long , long ago an old couple lived in a village . and , as they had no children to love and care for , they gave all their affection to a little dog . he was a pretty little creature , and instead of growing spoilt and disagreeable at not getting everything he wanted .
then sir [male] rode forth upon adventures . and came unto cornwall to seek sir [male] . and he delivered him from a prison where king mark had placed him . and then rode straight unto king mark and told him he had done himself great shame to treat so falsely sir [male] . the knight of most renown in all the world , then sir [male] departed .
next day [male] and his two sons . illann the fair and buinne the red , set out in their galley for the [male] of the sons of usna on loch etive . the day before their hurried flight from erin . [male] and [male] had been playing chess in their [male] with [male] , the king . the board was of fair ivory , and the chessmen were of red gold .
one day a king came riding along the road . and all of his people with him , he looked up and saw the apple hanging in the tree . and a great desire came upon him to have a taste of it . so he called one of the servants to him . and told him to go and ask whether it could be bought for a potful of gold .
the guilty come always to grief , [female] was arrested . charged with conspiracy to kill , tried , convicted , sentenced to be hanged , and before the sun went down was pardoned . in searching his cavern the police discovered countless human bones . much torn clothing , and a mighty multitude of empty purses . but nothing of any value -- not an article of any value .
she crept all over the deck , feeling for it in the darkness . after a while the cat helped , they worked all night . but could find nothing , in the morning , as it grew light . they both saw a dark green bottle caught in the top of the rope [male] which was fastened to the side of the boat . so lightly was the bottle held that it might easily have fallen back into the water and been lost again .
as he reached the spot , the moon came out from behind a bank of clouds . and [male] saw a poor dervish lying on the sand . he had a leopard skin thrown over his shoulders . by his side lay a big stick studded with sharp nails . and a basin made of the outer skin of a pumpkin in which he collected alms .
so off he went to the forest to hunt up the wild black horse . the saddle over his shoulder and the bridle over his arm . by and by came the wild black horse galloping through the woods like a thunder gust in summer . so that the ground shook under his feet . but the faithful servant was ready for him ; he caught him by the mane and forelock .
they had remained some time in the ship . when they awoke of a morning to see the city of sarras afore them . here they landed , and took out of the ship the table of silver . [male] and [male] going tofore and [male] behind . right so they went to the city , and at the gate of the city they saw an old bent man .
in the meantime [male] had returned to the stables . and one of the horses told him that [male] had been taken away by a cooper in a barrel . when the wicked magician heard this he was beside himself with rage . and , hastening to the kingdom of bello puojo . he went straight to an old woman who lived exactly opposite the royal palace .
the ant was naturally patient : she waited for an opportunity to bring to light the virtues of her pupil . the conduct of minute , and the prejudice of [female] . soon furnished her with one , they were informed that the flame of revolt was kindled in the mighty kingdom of minute . when this news had been confirmed by all the newspapers , the good fairy ant desired king [male] to set out . attended by a simple groom , to assist the queen , his neighbour .
they went sadly , all stiff and uncomfortable , and told the bouncible ball , it looked very grave . and great tears of salt water rolled down its red and green cheeks as it sat by the wet , seaweed covered rock . `` of course we can , '' they said—and so they were—for a day and a half . and then it wasn t exactly discontent but real naughtiness that brought them to grief . just then a fairy , with little bright wings the colour of a peacock 's tail .
i was always attentive to any means likely to deliver me out of so strange a metamorphosis . and had observed that the woman examined me with an extraordinary attention . i imagined that she might know something of my misfortune . and the melancholy condition i was reduced to : however , i let her go . and contented myself with looking at her , after walking two or three steps .
but how the children wished their mother were waiting for them in the little house to hear the tale ! one afternoon [person] and [person] started out for the forest children 's moss village to play with them . but when they got there they found all the little houses deserted . not a forest child was to be found , they must have gone into some other part of the forest to play . so [person] and [person] wandered on and on , a little lonely , a little tired of just each other for comrades .
the room was swept , the tables and benches rubbed . fire kindled on the hearth , and water ready drawn . and when he came home in the middle of the day . the table was laid , and a good meal spread upon it . he could not understand how it was done , for he never saw anybody in his house .
in those days there were but very few christians in [location] . the crescent of the false prophet had overcome for a time the cross of the true saviour . to the teachings of an old man , who in secret worshipped the true god . [female] owed the first lessons she got of christianity . and once the good seed was sown , it multiplied , [male] did not know that his daughter was a [male] .
scores of shadows immediately began an insane dance all about the room . disappearing , one after the other , through the uncovered window , and gliding darkly away over the face of the white snow . for the window looked at once on a field of snow . in a few moments , the room was quite cleared of them . but instead of being relieved by their absence , the king felt immediately as if he were in a dead house .
`` that will be delightful , '' she said , and clapped her little hands for joy . a large marble pillar lay on the ground , which , in falling , had been broken into three pieces . between these pieces grew the most beautiful large white flowers ; so the swallow flew down with tiny . and placed her on one of the broad leaves , but how surprised she was to see in the middle of the flower . a tiny little man , as white and transparent as if he had been made of crystal !
it was beautiful to see him , this one solitary creature . whose mate had never been created , but who needed no companion , and , living a great many hundred years . was as happy as the centuries were long , the more he did such things as mortal horses are accustomed to do . the less earthly and the more wonderful he seemed , [male] and the child almost held their breaths . partly from a delightful awe , but still more because they dreaded lest the slightest stir or [male] should send him up .
before the year was out , [male] and rosy red brought a little prince into the world . this made the old queen still more envious and spiteful than before ; and when night came . she slipped into the queen 's room . and whilst she slept , carried off the infant , and threw it into a pit which was full of snakes . then she returned , made an incision in one of the queen 's fingers .
when her two sisters returned from the ball , [female] asked them if they had again enjoyed themselves . and if the beautiful lady had been there , they told her that she was present . but had fled away when midnight sounded , and in such haste that she had let fall one of her little glass slippers . the prettiest thing in the world , they added that the king 's son . who picked it up , had done nothing but gaze at it for the rest of the ball .
[female] 's eyes and mine beheld her thus at the same moment . i stood transfixed with horror , [female] quietly went up to the child and took from her the trap . then he asked me to release his hand . i almost fainted when i saw it . `` it was the only way , '' said he .
the merman who had not spoken , and who was scritchy , still did not say a word . he looked at the others with his goggle eyes and then he tumbled off into the water and swam away as fast as he could and did not come back any more . all the other mermen looked after him in silence until he had disappeared . then one of them said in an awe struck voice , it 's bad for you . [male] , ai not it ? just think what you have been doing .
i have known some unfeeling husbands , who have treated their luckless wives with unvaried and unremitting unkindness . till perhaps the arrival of their last illness . and who then became all assiduity and attention , bat when that period approaches . their remorse , like the remorse of a murderer . is felt too late ; the die is cast ; and kindness or unkindness can be of little consequence to the poor victim .
the scimitar made a horrible hissing in the air . but , before the black could have time to make a second blow , [male] struck him on his right arm . with such force , that he cut it off . the dreadful scimitar fell with the hand that held it . and the black yielding under the violence of the stroke .
his lordship , as soon as he was on his legs . taking him for one of the pages abused him heartily for not coming sooner . and threatened him with dismissal from the king 's service for cowardice and neglect . he began indeed what bade fair to be a sermon on the duties of a page . but catching sight of the man who lay at his door .
chobei of bandzuin was the chief of the otokodaté of [location] . he was originally called [male] , and was the son of a certain ronin who lived in the country . one day , when he was only ten years of age . he went out with a playfellow to bathe in the river . and as the two were playing they quarrelled over their game , and [male] .
under all these circumstances , in about a week they concluded upon going down to the sea shore . trusting fortune might favour them by sending a boat or vessel that way . in which they might make good their escape , this they did . taking the goat ( which would not part from the boy ) . and their baggage along with them , as if in answer to their wishes .
the king promised a large reward to anyone who would free the land from this plague . but the beast was so big and strong that no one dared to go near the forest in which it lived . at last the king gave notice that whosoever should capture or kill the wild boar should have his only daughter to wife . now there lived in the country two brothers , sons of a poor man . who declared themselves willing to undertake the hazardous enterprise ; the elder .
the animal , as if understanding what the lad said , neighed and beat the ground with its hoofs . and seemed to say , `` yes , let [location] go ; i am ready to go . '' the lad came back to the castle , gave to the maidens many precious presents . and sent them away free , he gave the castle and the treasures in it to the fairies . himself taking only his saddlebags full of gold coins .
`` then there is no time to be lost , '' answered the princess ; and as she spoke she changed herself into a river . the prince into a bridge , the horse into a crow . and divided the wide road beyond the bridge into three little ones . when the soldiers came up to the bridge , they paused uncertainly . how were they to know which of the three roads the fugitives had taken ?
but the nyamatsane was not so easy to find as the woman had hoped , the husband walked on and on and on without ever seeing one . and every now and then he felt so hungry that he was obliged to eat one of the crusts of bread out of his bag . at last , when he was ready to drop from fatigue , he found himself on the edge of a great marsh . which bordered on one side the country of the nyamatsanes . but there were no more nyamatsanes here than anywhere else , they had all gone on a hunting expedition .
do you remember how we noticed at the beginning of the lecture that a [female] always likes to visit the same kind of plant in one journey ? you see now that this is very useful to the flowers , if the [female] went from a dead nettle to a geranium . the dust would be lost , for it would be of no use to any other plant but a dead nettle . but since the [female] likes to get the same kind of honey each journey . she goes to the same kind of flowers .
the telescope passed from hand to hand . but was not returned to the owner , whom i gazed at with astonishment , for i could not conceive how so large an instrument could have proceeded from so small a pocket . this , however , seemed to excite surprise in no one ; and the grey man appeared to create as little interest as myself . refreshments were now brought forward , consisting of the rarest fruits from all parts of the world . served up in the most costly dishes , mr. [male] did the honours with unaffected [male] .
`` you shall not , '' i cried , in my desperation i wrenched myself from his grasp and faced him . blocking the stairs , though the tone of his voice had softened . my fear of him grew greater , i would have fled up the stairs had he not again laid his hand on my arm . and [male] went , i heard of him again but once . that was when the papers reported his death of apoplexy while exercising at a public gymnasium .
the abbot of inisfalen awoke ere dawn of day . under the dewy green leaves went he forth to pray , the lake around his island lay smooth and dark and deep . and wrapt in a misty stillness the mountains were all asleep . low kneel would the abbot [male] when the dawn was dim and gray . the prayers of his holy office he faithfully gan to say .
the slaves of [female] did not cease to admire [female] 's wife till she left the hummaum . and even followed her till she entered her own house . when dusk had begun to gloom , and they became apprehensive of their [female] 's being displeased at their long absence . and so it happened , upon entering into her presence , [female] exclaimed . `` where have ye loitered , and what has been the cause of your unusually long stay at the hummaum ? ''
he waited for a long time , but no one came . after a while , when he got tired , he ate his sandwiches . they were really good , his mother had put extra sand in them . just as he finished his lunch , a [male] stung him . that got him angry again , and he felt that he could scare anybody who came along .
many were beautiful , and all had [person] eyes ; the younger men wore their hair in thick black curls . hanging about their faces , there were frightful old hags amongst them draped in discoloured garments that almost fell from their withered limbs . held only together by broad scarlet girdles that were wound innumerable times around their waists . one or two young girls were startlingly handsome ; they stood with heads thrown back . their hands on their hips , holding short white pipes between their flashing teeth .
after making their offerings to the god , they will call out . `` is there any uninvited guest present to whom we can make a gift ? '' you must then call out in reply , `` yes , i am here , '' they will see you and question you . and you must tell them all your story . the poor brahman woman agreed , she walked on until she came to the god [female] 's altar .
the rakhas asked to see them , but [male] would not leave the tree until the rakhas had sworn an oath to do him no harm . then he came down and opened the box and made the rakhas look into the mirror inside the box . and he also held up the second mirror saying that there was another rakhas . the rakhas was fascinated at the sight of his own reflection . when he grinned or opened his mouth the reflection did the same .
having finished with [male] , the old devil next approached [male] . he appeared before him disguised as one of the merchants of his kingdom . and established factories and began to make money , the `` merchant '' paid the highest price for everything he purchased . and the people ran after him to sell their goods . through this `` merchant '' they were enabled to make plenty of money .
he then searched upon the ground among the blades of grass . and at length found a nettle , which he pulled up by the roots . having breathed a charm over it , he passed it three times from one hand to the other . and lo , it was changed into a mighty coman . fit for the hand of [male] .
that was scarcely to be wondered at , for they had gone almost supperless to bed . and there was little if anything in the larder for their breakfast . [female] was ready a little before her sister , and hastened into the kitchen . to light the fire and prepare such food as there was , but just as [female] was turning to follow her . she was startled by a cry from [female] .
in the morning when they started , it had been clear and mild . the wild geese had flown high up in the air -- evenly , and without haste . with [female] at the head maintaining strict discipline . and the rest in two oblique lines back of her . they had not taken the time to shout any witty sarcasms to the animals on the ground .
there were two old men in the scow , one sat at the oars . and the other stood on a bench in the stern and held in his hand a short spear which was coarsely barbed . the one who rowed was apparently a poor fisherman , he was small . dried up and weather beaten , and wore a thin , threadbare coat , one could see that he was so used to being out in all sorts of weather that he did not mind the cold . the other was well [organization] and well dressed , and looked like a prosperous and self complacent farmer .
this modification probably belongs to the belief in the ka . which could be supported by the ka of the food and use the ka of the various objects . the figures of the objects being supposed to provide the kas of them . this system is entirely complete in itself , and does not presuppose or require any theologic connection . it might well belong to an age of simple animism .
all this time [male] had been in an agony of impatience . almost stepping on [male] in his eagerness , he jumped upon the box . and , arranging his hands as before , shouted loudly , [female] . this is [female] , a little girl , [female] , this is [female] . [male] 's step husband , then he sprang down and went running down the path again .
in describing it , [female] says that the ground everywhere smelt sweetly . and that a [male] , even tempered wind , which never blew faster or slower , breathed in his face as he went . making all the leaves point one way , not so as to disturb the birds in the tops of the trees . but , on the contrary , sounding a bass to their song , he describes also a little river which was so full that its little waves . as it hurried along , bent the grass , full of red and yellow flowers .
as to gravity , no one knows what it is . because it has not been determined whether it is atmospheric pressure that causes the apple to fall . or whether , 150 miles below the surface of the earth . supposedly one half way through the earth 's crust . there exists some powerful loadstone attraction that draws it , therefore , whether the apple .
a person named [female] neeut . or the well intentioned , being much distressed in his own country , resolved to seek a better livelihood in another . accordingly he took with him all he possessed . being only one single sherif , and began his journey , he had not travelled far when there overtook him a man . who entertained him with his conversation ; in the course of which it appeared that his name was [male] neeuteen , or double minded .
to make my long story short , i shall follow poor [female] , and let the other two take their chance . for i do not think there was much good in them , off poor [male] rides over hills . dales , valleys , and mountains . through woolly woods and sheepwalks , where the old chap never sounded his hollow bugle horn . farther than i can tell you to night or ever intend to tell you .
they sounded like commands of love . and with his wives he drank wine which seemed like love 's very life blood . then the king playfully pulled the hair of queen crescent . and a lotus petal fell from her hair into her lap , and the queen was so delicate that it wounded her . and she screamed and fainted , and the king was distracted , but when servants sprinkled her with cool water and fanned her .
with one hand [female] clung round [female] 's neck . and with the other she held up her little lantern aloft towards [female] . and [male] , lying on his chest in the water . was all the time steadily fighting the flood , right and left of [male] rose the ruins of the dyke like two great horns . [male] 's beard was touzled , his shoulders were bleeding .
at the same moment the two fairies , [male] and [male] . arrived in a chariot of venetian glass , drawn by six eagles of the largest size . `` save yourselves quickly , '' they cried to the two lovers . `` the tower is falling , and you will perish with it . '' they leapt into the fairy car .
the [male] began to vibrate as his feet stood upon the place where was concealed the [male] which had been used by the assassins . but was motionless elsewhere , still unsatisfied , the four bills were exhumed and concealed anew . the comptroller of the province himself bandaged the sorcerer 's eyes . and led him by the hand from place to place . the divining [male] showed no signs of movement till it approached the blood stained weapon .
over all the town of worms was heard the mirth of the company . king [male] bade [male] . his marshal , see to them well , who gave them goodly quarters . without and within they feasted ; never were strangers [male] entreated . all that they desired stood ready for them , for so rich was the king .
`` if you go , i shall go too , '' she replied quickly , following him and taking his hand . he did not quite like that , but he felt , as she was `` only a woman , '' he would let her , away they ran lightly . out into the [female] , happy to be in the warm , scented air . through the garden , off to the dear old rocks which were already drying nicely .
not many years since there lived in cornwall a pretty young girl named [female] . as she and her mother were poor , [female] determined to go out to service . so one morning early , she took her little bundle of clothes . and started out to find a place with some respectable family , she walked until she came to four cross roads . and , not knowing which to follow , she sat down on a boulder to think .

what is the origin of these mafulu people , with their short stature . small and somewhat rounded heads , slight but active build , [person] brown skin . and frizzly hair , predominantly brown in colour , and with their comparatively primitive ideas of organisation . and simple arts and crafts ? the question is one of no mere local interest . as the answer to it will probably be the answer to a similar question concerning most .
[female] began by degrees to show off ; but still wrought a little at his trade to blindfold the neighbours . in a very short time , however , he became a great man . so long indeed as he was a poor rascal , no decent person would speak to him . even the proud serving men at the `` big house '' would turn up their noses at him . and he well deserved to be made little of by others , because he was mean enough to make little of himself .
the old gnome watched him go with curious eyes . `` i wonder if he will return , '' he said to himself . and he decided not to sleep until he should know how it fared with the young man . it was not many days thereafter before the woodman returned to the forest . the lotion had been wondrous helpful , and had healed him more quickly than he had dared to hope .
the little old woman who makes war was in an excellent humor . and she received strong desire with rejoicing . she admired his prudence and assured him his bravery should never be questioned again . lifting up the head , which she gazed upon with vast delight . she said he need only have brought the scalp .
but all that while the brownies within the fir wood still , they watched her how she picked the wood . and strove to do no ill , with that the smallest penny , of the finest silver ore . upon the dry and slippery path , lay [female] 's feet before . with joy she picked the penny up . the fairy penny good ; and with her fagots dry and brown went wandering from the wood .

afterward they came to the town where the king lived . and bought a silken riband for the goat , they came to an inn . and orders had already been given there beforehand , that when such people came , they were to give them what they liked to eat and drink . the king would pay for all , so they tied the goat with that very riband and placed it in the innkeeper 's room to be taken care of . and he put it in the side room where his daughters slept .
his hound at his heel , his hawk on his wrist . a brave steed to carry him whither he list . and the green ground under him , and he went back to the castle . that night a brown bear , holding a burning coal in his mouth . came into the supper room and stood between [female] the queen and the chair that belonged to her .
only -- he did not , on the contrary his majesty actually smiled so far as a dog can smile . and ( the other dogs could not believe their eyes , but it was true . all the same ) his majesty wagged his tail , his majesty looked round him severely . and gave a slight growl , which produced instant silence , `` conduct my friends to the banqueting hall !

when , in doing this , the guest men reach the three last erected special trees in the middle of the enclosure . they attack the trees with their spears . never letting the spears leave their hands , and with kicks . and thus try to knock the trees down , if they succeed in doing so . then this part of the performance is at an end .

[male] , tailor , over his door .
the sun stood over a wide country , beyond the deep seas . beyond high mountains , where prince hero in a golden helmet . on a gallant horse , was drawing up his army , and preparing to march against [female] . the besieger of the fair princess , he had seen her three times in a dream . and had heard much about her , for her beauty was famous throughout the world .
all this happened in rosy 's case , and for awhile she sat talking . until her mamma was called away to attend to some household matter . by that time rosy was quite content to be tucked into a corner of the comfortable sofa . covered with a down quilt , and left to gaze into the depths of a woodfire . burning gently ( for it had passed the spitting , spluttering stage ) .
she put out her little finger , and [female] went and put a poisoned stab in it . and [male] fell dead , when the prince came home . and found [male] dead , he was in great sorrow . and when he saw how beautiful she was , he did not bury her at all . but he locked her in a room where nobody would get near her .
the gylfa ginning narrates that [female] , struck with the wisdom and power of the aser . as [male] and his followers were called , journeyed in the likeness of an old man . and under the assumed name of [male] , to [male] their chief residence . to inquire into and fathom their wisdom , aware of his design . the aser by their magic art caused to arise before him a lofty and splendid palace .
that evening after they had supped royally upon the very [female] that [female] had slain . [female] sweet songs of northern minstrelsy to the fair guest as she sat by [female] 's side . the golden arrow gleaming in her dark hair . the others all joined in the chorus , from will scarlet 's baritone to friar [female] 's heavy bass . even little [male] essayed to sing , although looked at threateningly by much the miller 's son .
just as it was proposed , long centuries after , to find a station for the ocean telegraph in the equally imaginary island of jacquet . which has only lately disappeared from the charts , with every step in knowledge the line of fancied stopping places rearranged itself . the fictitious names flitting from place to place on the maps . and sometimes duplicating themselves , where the tradition itself has vanished we find that the names with which it associated itself are still assigned . as in case of [location] and the antilles .
at last the chariot stopped : they were in the courtyard of a robber 's castle . the walls of which were cracked from top to bottom , ravens and crows flew in and out of every hole . and big bulldogs , which each looked ready to devour somebody , jumped about as high as they could . but they did not bark , for it was not allowed , a big fire was burning in the middle of the stone floor of the smoky old hall . the smoke all went up to the ceiling , where it had to find a way out for itself .
the peasant regretted the loss of his daughter bitterly . for although so simple she was still his child , the wicked sisters also shed tears . her father put the little silver plate and the little apple into a box . and locked them up , next morning a shepherd was tending his sheep near the place . playing on his pipe , and searching in the forest for one of his flock that was missing .
now in the cottage dwelt an old woman , her cat . and a hen ; and it was really they . and not she , who were masters of the house . the old woman , who passed all her days in spinning yarn . which she sold at the nearest town , loved both the cat and the hen as her own children .
the one he had captured , struggled and cried piteously ; but , in as few words as possible . he entreated her to be quiet , and to understand that if she was looking for a princess . he could tell her where she was , or at least where she had been . the water woman then became quiet , and the prince told her all he knew . and how anxious he was to find the beautiful princess , the good woman of the sea then told him that she and her companions had come up on the shore every night for a year .
the king and queen were horrified at the familiar way in which the little princess was speaking to such an important guest as the fairy godmother . it was true that she was only eight years old . but it was quite time she learnt some of the charming manners for which her brother the prince was so remarkable . if the fairy zigzag had turned her into a toad . or a marble statue , or something chilly like that , they would not have been in the least surprised .
in some respects the gulf fixed between virtue and vice in [location] is even greater than in england . the eastern courtesan is confined to a certain quarter of the town . and distinguished by a peculiarly gaudy costume , and by a head dress which consists of a forest of light tortoiseshell hair pins . stuck round her head like a saint 's glory . a glory of shame which a modest woman would sooner die than wear .
everybody seemed to be out of doors—men , women , and children—and nearly all were in holiday attire . a couple of priests , in vivid scarlet and yellow robes . were kotowing before an altar covered with a rich cloth , embroidered in white and silver . some chinese students from [organization] stood looking on with comprehending , half scornful interest . three girls lavishly dressed in colored silks , with their black hair plastered back from their faces and heavily bejewelled behind .
when the fair [male] understood sir [male] 's letter and his intent . she sent him another , and bade him be of good comfort . for she would make the vessel ready , and all things to purpose . then she had king mark taken and put in prison . until the time that she and sir [male] were departed unto the realm of logris .
`` what are you doing , [female] ? '' cried the little girl . when he saw her alarm . he broke off another rose , and then ran in by his own window , and left dear little [female] alone . when she next got out the picture book he said it was only fit for babies in long clothes . when his grandmother told them stories he always had a but .
she had forgotten her duties towards the living who were left her . and when she had offered this prayer , her heart felt lighter . the sun burst forth . over her head a little bird carolled his song . and the church bells sounded for the early service , everything around her seemed holy .
it was the colonel himself who came with the patrol . and he was not a little surprised when he found the recruit safe and sound . he wanted to have a report , but [male] would give him none . so he took him straight up to the king . and announced for the first time that here was the sentinel who had stood guard in the church over night .
when they had reached the mouth of the nile . they were borne up the river to the city of the great king . there the royal father and mother and a great multitude welcomed them to [location] . the queen kissed [organization] , and her lips were cool and soft on his brow as the petals of the lotus [female] . and afterwards she embraced [female] and thanked her for her devotion to her son .
the king was convinced of the young man 's sincerity . and with a letter of introduction , [male] set out for the court of the goldenhaired beauty . riding alone , according to his wish , and thinking as he went how he best could woo the princess for his beloved master . one day , alighting from his horse to write down some suitable words that had come into his mind . he saw a golden carp who , leaping from the water to catch flies .
[male] and his hosts , and his horses . and his dogs followed hard after him , but ever and awhile the boar made a stand . and many a champion of [male] 's did he slay . throughout all wales did [male] follow him . and one by one the young pigs were killed , at length , when he would fain have crossed the severn .
`` everything in its place , '' he cried . `` into the puddle with you , '' and he laughed aloud . for this was intended for wit , and the company joined in his mirth . the whole party shouted and clamoured , and the dogs barked their loudest , fortunately for herself . the poor girl in falling seized one of the hanging branches of the willow tree .
now he was fleeing that silent wilderness , bending his head against the driving wind and rain . against the storm of dust and sand that the wild gusts were throwing in his face . several times he turned in hopeless yearning towards that lonesome spot where his precious sword stood a lonely guardian of his lost happiness . then , covering his face in an agony too deep for tears . on he rushed as one who tries to escape from a sight he can not bear .
the tsar let out three doves just alike , and scattered buckwheat before them . [female] saw that one of them was shaking her wings all the time . he caught her by the wing and said . `` this is my bride , '' he brought out three maidens . one like the other in face , in stature , and hair .
when his last hope faded like the wave of twilight ebbing o'er the hills . he gave his heart to utter grief and deep despair . and the cold stars peer would down with pitiless stare . while sank the wind in silence on its flight through the dark hollows of the spacious night . and distant sounds seem would near , in his dismay he heard a fian calling far away .
soon after dawn he arose and clothed himself . and looking out of the window he saw the streets filled with a great host of people in black . and the weeping and the mourning were pitiful to hear , knights , with their armour craped . rode in great companies before ; then came the men at arms with weapons reversed . then the ladies of the household , and after these the priests came .
a few miles from the tontlawald was a large village . where dwelt a peasant who had recently married a young wife . as not uncommonly happens in such cases , she turned the whole house upside down . and the two quarrelled and fought all day long , by his first wife the peasant had a daughter called [female] . a good quiet girl , who only wanted to live in peace , but this her stepmother would not allow .
now he expected to die , but he held up his shield . and lost no ground , nor bated any cheer , all men that beheld him said they never saw knight fight so well as [male] did . considering the blood that he bled , and they were sorry for him . but [male] was so bold because of excalibur that he grew passing hardy . and called upon [male] to yield himself as recreant .
then out of the depths came [female] , [female] silver footed bride . for love of her gallant husband , and all her nymphs around her . and they played like [female] dolphins . diving on from wave to wave , before the ship , and in her wake . and beside her , as dolphins play , and they caught the ship .
[female] received the old red headed woodpecker with great ceremony . he had stood at the door awaiting his arrival . and as soon as he came in sight [male] commenced . while he was yet far off , bowing and opening wide his arms , in token of welcome . all of which the woodpecker returned in due form , by ducking his [male] .
she entered her own chamber and bolted the door . then she spread the skin of ashes on the pavement by the window and fell upon it . weeping violently , and crying in broken words : by this do i renounce the gods of egypt . by this do i change my heart and cleanse my lips . which , as he said , have offered prayers to idols .
the baby leaned against his breast and fell asleep again , and the miller became greatly troubled . for he was unused to babies and did not know how to handle them or care for them . but he sat very still until the little one awoke , and then , thinking it must be hungry . he brought some sweet milk and fed her with a spoon . the baby smiled at him and ate the milk as if it liked it .
now the grandfather asked the youngest grandson , [male] , but he . too , could recall nothing , and from under the stone crept the third hobgoblin . the youngest , the ugliest , horned with big horns , and black as a mole . the goblin gave a squeal , bit [male] 's foot . and then scuttled away under the stone like a lizard , but [male] gathered potent herbs and bound up his foot with them .
night came , and the prince took shelter behind a great rock . all the next day he labored to find the path . but in vain , he grew very hungry and cold , every once in a while he would hear the roaring of the waterfall . which seemed to have grown louder , another day dawned , and another day again . the prince was getting very weak , he knew that he was approaching the mysterious cataract .
upon this he forthwith conducted her to his chamber . where , leaving her to embrace her children , and cry along with them . he went and dressed a young hind , which the queen had for her supper . and devoured it with the same appetite as if it had been the young queen . exceedingly was she delighted with her cruelty .

[male] . and of the editor , when they heard their president say that he did not think it very nice in them to publish fairy books .
replied the magician ; `` it will be troublesome to you . '' indeed , uncle , answered [male] , i can not now . it is not troublesome to me : but i will as soon as i am up . the african magician was so obstinate , that he would have the lamp before he would help him up . and [male] , who had encumbered himself so much with his fruit that he could not well get at it .
`` ask colonel [male] to come right up , '' said [male] . with difficulty repressing the guffaw that struggled within him for expression . recognizing the name at once , five minutes later [male] walked in . the perfect picture of a military dandy , largely due no doubt to the cut of his [male] . `` well , '' he said , removing his gloves , and out of sheer force of habit proceeding to wash his face with his right paw .

he loved `` what happened , '' and would not evade it by the swerve of a hair . so on this occasion what was occurring he would have occur , although a king was his rival and his master . it may be that his mother was watching the match and that he could not but exhibit his skill before her . he committed the enormity of winning seven games in succession from the king himself , , ! it is seldom indeed that a subject can beat a king at chess .

they would not listen to a word he said . but sent him back to [male] with the blood running down his face . when [female] saw that she leaped up in a fury and was rushing at the house . into which she would certainly have broken ; but [female] called her . and made her lie down beside him while he bethought him what next he should do .
that night the little jackdaw lay awake , while all the others slept . waiting to hear the green stone break out into sorrow . and to see if its winged mate would come seeking it , but after hours had gone . and nothing stirred or spoke , he slipped softly out of the nest , and went down to search for the poor little winged mate who must surely be about somewhere . and now , truly , among the grasses and flowers he heard something sobbing and sighing .
butgeorge , listening , heard the voices of grooms in the stables . which , entering , he found two grooms furnishing forth a horse against some business . whereupon , taking the staple with which he had redeemed himself from prison . he slew the grooms , and mounting the palfrey rode boldly to the city gates . where he told the watchman at the bronze tower thatgeorge having escaped from the dungeon .
note : this little tale , from the `` sin tsi hia , '' is a literary masterpiece because of the exactness with which the punishment follows upon the act . long after the latter has been forgiven , and all chance of mishap seemed to have passed . once upon a time there lived a man in tsing tschoufu who had passed his military examination . and had been ordered to tsinanfu to report for duty , it was at the season of rains .
at length the sun begun to rise , a [female] warmth came over the place . the tongue of the old man became silent , the [male] and the blue bird began to sing on the top of the lodge . the stream began to [male] by the door . and the fragrance of growing herbs and flowers came softly on the vernal breeze . daylight fully revealed to the young man the character of his entertainer .
he stumbled and fell on his nose as he was running . [female] found herself hanging by her clothes on a thorn tree . and she banged her foot against a sharp stone so that she shrieked with pain . in fact the children could not understand what was the matter with them on this particular day . and they gave up their game , and slunk dejectedly through the wood .
aladdin 's mother , terrified at the sight of the genie , fainted . when the lad , who had seen such another phantom in the cavern . snatched the lamp out of his mother 's hand . and said to the genie boldly : `` i am hungry , bring me something to eat . '' the genie disappeared immediately , and in an instant returned with a large silver tray .
in the morning i took [male] 's place in his church . we had the english liturgy again , the thatched dome . with much tinier windows than the windows at home . but much more sun to fill them , seemed a sort of parable to me that morning . after i had finished the rite , i stayed on in the church .
the woodpecker was the first to try a mouthful of the bear 's meat . but he had no sooner began to taste it than it changed into a dry powder . and set him coughing , it appeared as bitter as ashes . the moose was affected in the same way , and it brought on such a dry [male] as to shake every bone in his body . one by one , each in turn joined the company of coughers .
on the top of the mountain sat an old witch with golden hair . and in her hand was the white bird , the prince opened his book of knowledge . and there he read that if one would gain the white bird one would have to catch the witch by her golden hair . for then she would be compelled to grant whatever was asked of her ; only he would have to be very careful in his doings . for if the witch caught sight of him upon the black hill she would change him into a stone just as she had all the rest who had come that way .
all happened as it had twice before , the comrade knocked , the hill opened . and inside a witch came to meet them with a chair . and bade them sit down , the two had gone through many rooms before the comrade spied an old hat hanging on a [male] behind the door . the hat he must have , but the old witch would not part with it . since it was her three sisters hat .
all right , said [person] , come along ; we ll have a fine time. so they went away up the hill , and , as it was a bright day . they stayed till evening , when they had driven a little way they met two foot passengers . a pin and a needle , who called out : `` stop , stop , '' they said it would soon be pitch dark . and they couldn t walk a step farther .
as she spoke , the kitten saved her the trouble of removing it from the basket by jumping out of its own accord on to the table . where it sat glowering at the party , and making a low noise between a [female] and a growl . until mrs. long brought it some milk . with which it proceeded to regale itself , and the children . having had a slice of cake each , and been duly charged with the good lady 's thanks to their father .
then , with his forehead disfigured by a fearful frown , he continued to abuse the prince . and having tied his hands behind him , dragged him from the room . [male] , naturally brave , and encouraged by belief in that former existence the remembrance of which had so wonderfully arisen in his mind . bore all the insults with firmness , and saying to the princess . remember that speech of the swan , have [female] for two months .
so that evening the fox was absent , and the wolf was alone in the cave . but it was not to a christening that the sly fox went ; it was to the keg of butter that was buried in the sand . about midnight he returned , looking fat and sleek , and well pleased with himself . the wolf had been dozing , but he looked up drowsily as his companion entered . `` well , how did they name the bairn ? '' he asked .
after a time her road led through a wood . full of soft airs and sweet odours , and before she had gone a hundred yards she saw a wonderful silver castle suspended by strong silver chains to four of the largest trees . it was so perfectly hung that a [female] breeze rocked it sufficiently to send you pleasantly to sleep . fairer than a fairy felt a strong desire to enter this castle , but besides being hung a little above the ground there seemed to be neither doors nor windows . she had no doubt ( though really i can not think why ) that the moment had come in which to use the nut which had been given her .
she was the boatman 's daughter . and was graceful and delicate as a gentleman 's child ; had she been differently dressed . no one would have imagined that she came out of the hut on the neighbouring heath . there lived her father , who was a widower . and supported himself by carrying firewood in his great boat out of the forest to the estate of silkeborg .
as he drove over from strasburg and came within view of the dark forest which was his home . when he saw for the first time since his departure the powerful frames . the friendly , [male] faces of the black foresters ; as his ears caught the old familiar homely sounds . he put his hand to his heart . for his pulse beat more quickly , and he was sure that in another moment he must either rejoice or weep .
so they all went home together to the widow 's cottage . and [male] was married to the prince and [male] to his brother . they divided between them the great treasures which the dwarf had amassed . the old mother lived many quiet and happy years with her children . but when she left her cottage for the palace she took the two rose trees with her .
after that the prince and the swan [male] were married . and a grand wedding they had of it . with music of fiddles and kettle drums . and plenty to eat and to drink , i , too , was there ; but all of the good red wine ran down over my tucker . so that not a drop of it passed my lips .
the trap was made by the best rules of magic . and there was no such a thing as getting out , even if one was as small as a mouse . as for the little black fellow who had been in pickle , he laughed and danced until the old woman . glaring at him between the wires , ordered him to turn into a toad . but , unfortunately for her , she had dropped her magic wand outside of the cage .
she had two fine beautiful sons , [female] the hollow and [female] . [female] was a dancer could step on a plate and not put a break in the delf . and [female] could sing every ballad and song was ever heard tell of at all . they were wild daring lads , too , the way there was great talk of them in the countryside . and the lamentations of the youth of the world were more nor a fright when news came round to the neighbours that [male] was dead .
`` throw down the brush , '' said the horse , when it again heard the trampling of the tripod near them . the rider threw the brush , which turned into a dense growth of reeds . through which the old hag forced her way with much difficulty and many a groan . `` throw the curry comb , '' cried the horse for the third time . when he had flung that down , the poor boy looked back and saw a whole forest of knives and swords .
`` yes , '' said tootles , and pointed to her as she lay motionless on the ground . the boys did not know what to do , they did not like to carry her down into the cave . as it might not be sufficiently respectful , so they planned to build a house over her . only they did not know what kind of house to build . and the boys fetched logs out of the forest .
mutinosa felt there was no use in disobeying . so she did as she was bid and said nothing . after some time she gave birth to a most lovely little girl . and when she was well again the fairy gave her a good lecture on her past life . made her promise to behave better in future , and sent her back to the king , her husband .
while he pondered a plan for the accomplishment of this . the lion witch vanished , he ran round and round the lake . but no sooner did the palace draw near enough . at one point or another , to let him make a spring for it . than it suddenly receded with menacing speed , as often as his hopes were raised they were dashed to the ground .
the french have several variants of the story ofgeorge and the dragon . at the castle of vaugrenans , for instance . there lived a lovely lady whose beauty had led her far astray from the path of virtue . she was changed into a basilisk and terrorised the country by her misdeeds . her son [male] was a handsome knight .
that is just it , the rest of [location] rarely try to see things in that way . so you see i have proved my case . you are too amiable , not for to night , mr. [male] . everybody is of one mind to night . there is but one point of view -- you are giving nothing but pleasure .
the goddess of charms and magic arts received them kindly . and invited them to be seated ; but instead of doing so they assumed a supplicating attitude . and humbly besought her [female] , they then informed her of the dreadful crime which they had committed . and implored her to purify them from it . this [female] promised to do , she forthwith commanded her attendant naiads to kindle the fire on the altar .
we are in the forest by these deep lakes . we see swans in flocks fly over us . and swim upon the rapid elv and on the still waters , the forests . we perceive , continue to extend further towards the west and the north . and are more dense as we proceed : the carriage roads cease , and one can only pursue one 's way along the outskirts by the solitary path .
he kept continually on the watch , looking upward at the sky . or else down into the water , hoping forever that he should see either the reflected image of the winged horse . or the [male] reality , he held the bridle . with its bright gems and golden bit , always ready in his hand . the rustic people who dwelt in the neighbourhood , and drove their cattle to the fountain to drink .
once upon a time there lived a monk at puto who was exceedingly learned . an aged man had led him into the cave in question . where he had seen a number of volumes on the book stands . the aged man had said : `` these are the histories of the various dynasties . '' in a second room were to be found the histories of all the peoples on earth .
and when the giant understood what a great traveller [male] had been . he made a truce with him at once . and would have kept him there to this day to pick his brains . so delighted was he at finding any one to tell him what he did not know before . `` ah , you lucky little dog , '' said he at last .
no sooner did they discover who it was that dared to champion [female] with such bold and haughty front . than with hideous yells and screams they rushed tumultuously upon him . hoping by a combined attack to confuse him and to make him fly in terror before them . in this however they had reckoned without their host , with a daring quite as great as theirs . but with a skill far superior to that of the six infuriated demons , monkey seized a javelin which came gleaming through the air just at the precise moment that he needed it .
how she found her way to olympus is known only to herself . i believe she first climbed some rocks , then a cloud . then sprang over a rainbow bridge , and at last scaled a long sunbeam . which led her straight to the marble steps of [female] 's high throne . how joyfully she mounted , sometimes looking up to marvel at the height of the steps .
so he told his wife they would be nice morsels if she served them up with plenty of sauce . he then fetched a large knife , and began to sharpen it on a long whetstone that he held in his left hand . and all the while he came nearer and nearer to the bed . the ogre took up one of the children , and was going to set about cutting him to pieces . but his wife said to him : what in the world makes you take the trouble of killing them to night ?
the most powerful giants of the whole country were suitors for [male] 's hand . and [male] promised his daughter to him who should excel in swiftness in the race . or whose arm should be strongest to hurl huge boulders , then the mighty men came down from their castles in the mountains . where the snowstorm sweeps round the hoary peaks , and from sea-side fortresses . till [male] 's roof could scarcely give shelter to the host of powerful suitors .
`` it is the sea serpent , '' he faltered at last , as soon as he recovered his power of speech -- the monster of which the fairy told me that death and destruction follow in its wake . the poor sailors up above on the surface of the water . who have perhaps laughed and mocked at it as an exploded fable , will now see and feel it in the last terror of the death struggle .
`` quick , '' said the wizard , in a low voice . and he rushed towards the empty holes , which even in the night shone brightly from the treasures within them . flinging himself on his knees , the old man began filling the wallets he had brought . listening intently all the time for the return of the stones up the hill . while [male] more slowly put handfuls of all he could see into his pockets .
yes , [female] was ready enough to learn , but he did not for all that trust himself to go very close to [male] . as you may fancy , it was not long before [male] found out a horse that lay asleep in the [male] . and then he did as [male] had told him . for he knotted and bound himself well into the hair of his tail . and made his teeth meet in the horse 's thigh .
upon one of these excursions he overheard some fire fairies repeating the story of the enchantment of princess white flame . and learned at the same time about the earth fairy 's imprisonment . after that he could not rest until he had found the way to the place where she was confined . during all the years that the earth fairy had been locked in her prison . she had known nothing of what went on outside of it .
`` thank you , '' said [male] . and he drove away with his little nephew and by and by they came to the little house . and sure enough , when they knocked on the door , [male] opened it . but goodness me , when they told him what they wanted . he did not seem at all pleased , i guess he wanted the strawberries for himself .
it was not dark yet , so there were games and races . followed by a little rest , during which mother told them stories . then [male] , the funny man of the party . gave an imitation of all the animals in a farmyard . which was even better than the real thing , of a railway train coming out of a tunnel .
now , it happened that this day was the last day of the hundred years . and when the prince came to the thicket that surrounded the castle and began to push his way through . he found that the briers yielded readily to his touch . the thorns had all blossomed into roses that scented the air with fragrance as he went by . primroses sprang up before his feet and made a pathway to lead him straight to the castle gates .
the girl promised , and then after bidding her good by the evil one rode away . but to her , too , before leaving , he gave a bunch of flowers . and begged her to wear it until he returned . after he had gone the girl began to go through the house . and when she saw all the treasures that were in it she could hardly restrain her joy .
they lived off the path , in a wild , lonesome place . far retired from neighbors and undisturbed by cares , they passed their time content and happy . the days glided by as serenely as the river that flowed by their lodge . owing to his lack of strength , [male] never engaged in the chase but gave his attention entirely to the affairs of the lodge . in the long winter evenings he passed the time in telling his brother stories of the giants .
immediately there was a loud explosion ; the hideous bat skin split asunder and shrivelled up . revealing a beautiful young prince , who stepped unsinged from the ring of flame . and bent his knee before the queen [female] . she recognized in him a playmate of her childhood . prince [male] , son of a neighboring monarch .
his father and mother had died when he was only a babe . and the people who had the care of him were very poor . [male] was not old enough to work , and so he had a hard time of it indeed . sometimes he had no break fast , and sometimes he had no dinner . and he was glad at any time to get a crust of bread or a drop of milk .
the next moment the door came flying in , and those outside along with it . they knocked him down , and kicked him . and knelt on his body till it came to midnight . but as soon as the cock crew they all disappeared . the irishman was little more than alive by this time , as soon as daylight appeared the princess came .
the true story teller , it seems to me . is he who is able to grasp these implications and turn them to his own use . i must confess that the setting in which i have placed the famous old serbian nonsense story . in my young days when i was an old , old man . is my own invention , the nonsense story needs a setting and as it chanced i had one ready as i have long wanted to tell the world what was back of the determination of that princess who refused to eat until some one had made her laugh .
and the resurrection has been glorious , not by the might of the soldier , or by arms or war . though the [person] never flinch from duty . or before the foe -- but by the power of poet . singer and the narrator of stories . that touch the imagination , and fire the soul to noble deeds .
the [female] , supposing that one of her neighbours had called and required assistance . opened the door , and a woman entered , having in her hand a pair of wool carders . and bearing a horn on her forehead , as if growing there , she sat down by the fire in silence . and began to card the wool with violent haste , suddenly she paused . and said aloud : `` where are the women ? they delay too long . ''
with this , looking again at the rock with a sad and bewildered face , and then casting a sorrowful glance at the bear . which lay by the door of the lodge , the hunter took his leave . bewailing bitterly at heart the loss of his friend and his bear . he was scarcely out of sight when [male] sent the children to get red willow sticks . of these he cut off as many pieces , of equal length .
if , only three hundred years ago , this were the case , what must have been [male] 's fun . when he saw men in the early days . working so hard to make even a clay cup or saucer . these people who slept and ate in cave boarding houses , knew nothing of metals . or how to make iron or brass tools .
on the [male] ofjohn , as king [male] returned from the chase . and by the high road approached camelot , he met a fair company . in the van went two youths , leading two white mules . one freighted with a silken pavilion , the other with robes proper for a newly made knight . the mules bore two chests , holding the hauberk and the iron boots .
oftentimes he called to her and prayed of her . but she would not ; and when he sought to seize her she dived into the water as a seal might dive . nor did he see her again that day , and each day the sound of her voice became sweeter to his ears . so sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his cunning . and had no care of his craft , vermilion finned and with eyes of bossy gold .
his courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order . the stone began to give way under his feet . and sank slowly down into the depths , when it was once more firm . and the tailor looked round , he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the former . here , however , there was more to look at and to admire , hollow places were cut in the walls .
and the clouds were so thick in the sky that the sunlight could not get through them . so that the day grew dark as night , which added to the terrors of the storm . the captain of the ship was not afraid , because he had seen storms before . and had sailed his ship through them in safety . but he knew that his passengers would be in danger if they tried to stay on deck .
charmed with these words , and still more by the tone in which they were uttered . the prince assured her that he loved her more than his life . for a long time did they sit talking , and yet had not said half enough . their only interruption was the little dog [male] . who had awakened with his [female] , and now began to be jealous that the princess did not notice him as much as she was wont to do .
for , instead of being ready to play with him again , the little princess was far too miserable to think of playing at all . he tried all day long to coax her into a good humour . but bedtime came , and he had not won a single smile from her . it was then that he made up his mind to go out into the world and find the lady [male] . so that night the prince once more unhooked the diamond key from the nail on the nursery wall .
but the clergyman stood in the pulpit in the church . and spoke so loud and so angrily , he said that mankind was so wicked . and that god would punish them for it . and that when they died , the wicked went down into hell , where they would burn for ever . and he said that their worm would never die , and their fire never be extinguished .
if this light and this sun were only shining on [location] ! it would suit the boy 's father and mother to a dot to have a working day that lasted twenty-four hours . the boy raised his head and looked around , perfectly bewildered , it was mighty [male] ! here he lay sleeping in some place where he had not been before . no , he had never seen this glen nor the mountains round about ; and never had he noticed such puny and shrunken birches as those under which he now lay .
who could resist the pleading of so wise and compassionate a judge ? [male] forgave his subject at once at the request of his august guest . the [male] was so glad that he shook his fins for joy . and he and all the other fish went out from the presence of their king . praising the virtues of the happy hunter , now that the [male] was found the happy hunter had nothing to keep him in [male] . and he was anxious to get back to his own kingdom and to make peace with his angry brother .
the little girl dutifully obeyed the bidding , but the kiss the boy gave his playmate strongly resembled a blow with the mouth . [female] laughed merrily , turned her back on the children . and went slowly down into the valley , during her walk all sorts of little incidents flashed through her mind with the speed of lightning . memories of the days when she herself was a little girl and [female] had played with her daily . as the curly headed syrus now did with the herdsman 's daughter .
so saying , he put on his hat of plaited rushes . drew on his green coat , and rose to the surface to place himself not far from the boat among the willows by the river 's brink . in the next village lived a distant relation , and the fair gave an excellent excuse for paying her a visit . the little girl dressed herself in her best , said good-bye to her parents . and received injunctions to stay all night with her friends .
the germ of the story of [male] and the bean stalk is to be found in old hindu tales , in which the beans are used as the symbols of abundance . or as meaning the moon , and in which the white cow is the clay and the black cow is the night . there is also a russian story in which a bean falls upon the ground and grows up to the sky . and an old man , meaning the sun , climbs up by it to heaven .
the good woman stood motionless with fear and wonder . and the lions , after kissing the little girl , who returned their caresses . ran off , and disappeared in an instant , leaving her in the good wife 's hands . recovering from her fright she looked at the child . who never ceased kissing her , took her in her arms , and went into the cavern to show her to her husband .
now , no traveller ever passed through the kingdom without inquiring how it came to be so small . and this was the reason , as soon as [male] ( for that was the king 's name ) . had been born , his father and mother betrothed him to the niece of their friend the fairy [female] . if she should ever have one , but as the years passed on , and [male] was still without a niece . the young prince forgot all about his destined bride , and when he was twenty five he secretly married the beautiful daughter of a rich farmer .
some days later he came with a person of his own kind . but of another sex , her hair was dressed with great taste . and she had a lovely voice , this new arrival induced the ladies to go down to the door . they were surprised to find that , after trying various languages , she at last spoke to them in their own . and paid [female] a very pretty compliment on her beauty .
the queen heard everything the two below her said . and she felt very sorry for them because they were in such distress and terror . she flew down to a branch just over their heads and spoke to them in a soothing manner . when mother sheep heard this she was comforted . for she saw at once that it was a queen that was speaking to her .
a most remarkable series of transformations occurs in the [female] romance `` the history of taliesin , '' written about the thirteenth century , [female] , who is boiling a charmed mixture from which she hopes to secure `` the three blessed drops of the [female] of inspiration , '' for her ugly and deformed son , leaves her cauldron for a moment . in which space of time one of her servants unfortunately obtains the benefit of her wisdom . in her anger she threatens him and he .
they brought up the boy in great luxury . one day when the child was at school he quarrelled with one of his playmates . this taunt was thrown in his face : ah , ha ! you think your father was always rich , do you ? he is a rich man now , it is true .
for a fortnight diamond went on driving his cab , and keeping his family . he had begun to be known about some parts of [location] . and people would prefer taking his cab because they liked what they heard of him . one gentleman who lived near the mews engaged him to carry him to the city every morning at a certain hour . and diamond was punctual as clockwork -- though to effect that required a good deal of care .
since the day of the quarrel [male] had seen nothing of him . it was , therefore , with great surprise that he saw [male] one evening enter his lodgings and invite him to take a walk with him . the chieftain smiled sadly as he saw his old friend take down his sword and buckle it on . there was a great change in the appearance of [male] vohr . his cheek was hollow , his eye burned as if with fever .
ferko was at a loss to understand how he could have eaten in his sleep . but he said nothing , and fasted all that day and the next night . but on the following morning he was so hungry that he burst into tears . and implored his brothers to give him a little bit of their bread . then the cruel creatures laughed , and repeated what they had said the day before .

and all the payment the [female] ever asked for was a bowl of broth . from the very day of her marriage [female] had noted with surprise and rage that things ceased to be done for her as they had been done all the weeks and months before . she complained to [male] of his laziness . and he only stared at her , not understanding what she was talking about . but the [male] , who was standing by , burst out laughing , and confessed that all the good offices she spoke of had been performed by him .
mopsa said she would rather not , because she did not like the hairy elephants . `` there are no such things as hairy elephants , '' said [male] , in his dream ; but he had hardly spoken when out of a wood close at hand some huge creatures . far larger than our elephants , came jogging down to the water , there were forty or fifty of them . and they were covered with what looked like tow , in fact .
she happened to touch the pet poodle . when it immediately became a golden dog , the [male] . at this , became more nervous than ever , and shrieked whenever his daughter came near him . the servants shunned her , too , fearful of the consequences of touching her , poor [female] . a more unhappy girl did not go to bed that night , but she had eaten the magic fish and wished for gold .

suddenly was heard the sound of drums and fifes . the bright blaze of a fire shot up from time to time . and its ruddy gleams seemed to contend with the bluish light of the torches . the councillor stood still , and watched a most strange procession pass by . first came a dozen drummers , who understood pretty well how to handle their instruments .

up to the crescent boat on to heaven the golden , and to the throne of the loving god . had passed the spirit of the little child , just then a bright star fell down from the fleecy clouds and rested upon the pure . ice cold forehead , leaning so heavily against the great pillar of the stately doorway . the cadence of the last chime was dying away upon the still night air . it was twelve o clock , and the musician went home .
mr. [male] will understand that we can not take much interest in an anonymous hymn of the seventeenth century . it is enough for [location] to know that the hymn in question could not have been written by a [location] man . for the very good reason that [location] did not exist in the seventeenth century . that is to say , it existed merely as the haunt of the musquash and the mud turtle . and not as the living , breathing metropolis of today .
so he turned his back and sat by his window looking out over the sea . and weeping great tears for his lost daughter , till his white hair and beard grew down over his shoulders and twined round his chair and crept into the chinks of the floor . and his tears , dropping on to the window ledge . wore a channel through the stone and ran away in a little river to the great sea . and meanwhile his granddaughter grew up with no one to care for her or clothe her .
he called a message to [male] choo upstairs through a tube in the wall . in a few moments she appeared , listless , [female] , and hollow eyed . but when her husband told her the young lawyer 's suggestion she became as one electrified . her form straightened , her eyes glistened ; the color flushed to her cheeks . the young man felt somewhat embarrassed ; his eyes shifted a little under the intense gaze of the chinese mother .
the other two started and shrank farther back into the shadow of the wall , for the sturdy figure of their runaway principal could indeed be seen shuffling along in the twilight in front . a bag in each hand , he looked much the same as when they first saw him . except that he had changed his picturesque mountaineering knickers for a conventional pair of trousers . it was clear he was already escaping from the hotel . the lane down which they followed him was one of those that seem to be at the back of things .
but now they arched their heads , and pawed the ground with their slender legs as they had been wont to do in days long gone by . the king 's heart beat with delight . but the old groom who had had the care of them stood crossly by . and eyed the owner of this wonderful creature with hate and envy . not a day passed without his bringing some story against the youth to his master .
and she lifted him up , and drew his head to her breast . saying the while little words of love and comforting . whereafter , he stood straight before her , and they looked each into the other 's eyes as they had been spirits out of the flesh . and there came a shining round about them . that was brighter than the noonday sun , for that [male] , the radiant one .
so the serpent blew and on the iron platform that came of his breath three bottles met him in combat . back and forth they raged , three bottles striking right and left with his mighty sword . the serpent hitting at three bottles with all his scaly heads and belching forth fire and smoke from all his mouths . three bottles whacked off one scaly head and at last a second one . but he was unable to touch the third , `` i shall have to have help , ''
as he rambled far and wide , through the wild country , he felt a strong desire to know how the plants and herbs and berries grew . without any aid from man , and why it was that some kinds were good to eat . and that others were possessed of medicinal or poisonous power , on the third day [male] became weak and faint . and kept his bed , suddenly he fancied , as he lay thus . that a bright light came in at the lodge door .
his father and mother were sitting there , [male] was delighted to see them . but he did not say a word , and he wondered whether they would be surprised at his having stayed away so long . the bird had said that they would not , he drew a little nearer . his mother sat with her back to the open window . but a candle was burning , and she was reading aloud .
when news of its destroyings came to the ears of the father of his people .

to all this the prince replied only by sighs and tears . he made an effort to get up , and calling his servants . went himself to his wardrobe , and having caused several bundles of rich furniture and plate to be packed up . he ordered them to be carried to the jeweller 's house . the jeweller would fain have declined this kind offer .
frederic wished to have a closer look at the boy 's sword . and put out his hand to touch it , when the youngster began to shout and cry . `` my sword , my sword , he is going to take my sword !

the best authority on `` empire furniture '' is the book of designs . published in 1809 by the architects percier and [person] . which is the more valuable as a work of reference , from the fact that every design represented was actually carried out . and is not a mere exercise of fancy , as is the case with many such books . in the preface the authors modestly state that they are entirely indebted to the antique for the reproduction of the different ornaments .

fate , being in a funny mood , pushed the door open and introduced into those long . strict , sea flanked apartments one who was perhaps the most startling opposite of them and their master . in answer to a curt but civil summons . the door opened inwards and there shambled into the room a shapeless little figure . which seemed to find its own hat and umbrella as unmanageable as a mass of luggage .

the river god cares naught for the fortunes or misfortunes of human beings . he appears suddenly and disappears in the same way . as best suits him , between the outer and the inner dam of the yellow river are a number of settlements . now it often happens that the yellow water moves to the very edge of the inner walls . rising perpendicularly , like a wall , it gradually advances , when people see it coming they hastily burn incense .
entire verses too were written over the windows in old-fashioned letters . and grotesque faces , curiously carved , grinned at you from under the cornices . one story projected a long way over the other , and under the roof ran a leaden gutter with a dragon 's head at the end . the rain was intended to pour out at the dragon 's mouth . but it ran out of his body instead , for there was a hole in the gutter .
but [female] was gone , he ran home to tell his grandfather—but his grandfather was not there—only a letter lay on the kitchen table . this seemed such good advice to [male] , whose name was also in the register . that he was just going to take it when the door was flung open . and in rushed the king and the army , they hustled and bustled and rustled round the house . breaking and tearing everything , and when there was nothing more to spoil they carried [male] off to prison .

the sultan of casgar fell into a passion against the [male] merchant . you are very bold , said he , to tell me a story so little worth my hearing . and then to compare it with that of my jester , can you flatter yourself so far as to believe that the trifling adventures of a young rake can make such an impression upon me as those of my jester ? well , i am resolved to hang you all four to revenge his death . this said , the purveyor fell down at the sultan 's feet .
ellen stared , she had never heard anything so curious ; for the lad to have come all that way and through all those dangers . and then want to play with a puzzle the first thing , the gate keeper . however , did not seem at all surprised , he walked over to one of the golden pillars and took a key from the bunch at his side . and now [male] noticed that in each of the pillars was a narrow door . the gate keeper unlocked the one in front of which he stood .
