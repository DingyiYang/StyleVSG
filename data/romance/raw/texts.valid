[female] read the mystery after her own manner . and on the following night , at the approach of ten o'clock . she went into the parlour of the hall . whence a window looked out on to the road . the day had been dull and the night was misty , a heavy white hand seemed to have come down on to the face of sea and land .
all the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches . whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches , to that end kutuzov 's activity was directed during the whole campaign from [location] to vilna . not casually or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it , kutuzov felt and knew . not by reasoning or science but with the whole of his russian being -- what every russian soldier felt . that the french were beaten , that the enemy was flying and must be driven out .
they turned in on the left by the church with the italian porch . whose helical columns were heavily draped with creepers , and pursued the lane till there arose on jude 's sight the circular theatre with that well-known lantern above it . which stood in his mind as the sad symbol of his abandoned hopes . for it was from that outlook that he had finally surveyed the city of colleges on the afternoon of his great meditation . which convinced him at last of the futility of his attempt to be a son of the university .
she knew unsuspected corners that were secretly occupied by little old couples . she knocked at their door and introduced [male] to them as a prince charming who had asked for her hand . and the two of them , sitting on some worm eaten `` property , '' would listen to the legends of the opera . even as , in their childhood , they had listened to the old breton tales . those old people remembered nothing outside the opera .
they were sitting together on the balcony , with the bees very busy in the lilac bush near them . and the doves murmuring to each other at the end of the garden . [female] was reading a guide book on brittany . and miss [female] , with her knitting in her hands . was listening to bits the girl read aloud , and watching a little frown grow between the eyebrows .
hardly were they hidden when the door opened a little , it struck against the bales the very young man had piled against it . for a moment it held , but with [organization] of the men pushing from the other side . it slowly yielded and swung open , targo stepped into the room . to the very young man he seemed nearly a hundred feet high . only his feet and ankles were visible at first , from where the very young man was watching .
it was in vain that certain clear headed men among the clergy . of whom [male] himself was one , pointed out that the bishop after all might perhaps be right . that if mr. [male] were guilty , and if he should be found to have been so by a jury . it might be absolutely necessary that an ecclesiastical court should take some cognizance of the crime beyond that taken by the civil law . the jury , said [male] , discussing the case with mr. [male] and other clerical neighbours ,
then he began a long explanation of his conduct . excusing himself in vague terms . in default of being able to invent better , she yielded to his words . still more to his voice and the sight of him . so that , she pretended to believe , or perhaps believed ; in the pretext he gave for their rupture .
[male] has an intense hatred for [male] . the king 's superintendent of finances . and has resolved to use any means necessary to bring about his fall , with the new rank of intendant bestowed on him by [male] . [male] succeeds in having two of [male] 's loyal friends tried and executed . he then brings to the king 's attention that [male] is fortifying the island of belle ile en mer .
[female] had become a familiar figure in the village life by that time . [male] depended on him with a sort of wistful confidence that set him to grinding his teeth occasionally in a fury at his own helplessness . and , as the extent of the disaster developed , as he saw [male] failing and [male] ageing . and when in time he met [male] . the feeling of his own guilt was intensified , he spent hours studying the case .
at times she became serious and stared at her little [female] gown . [female] was no longer in rags ; she was in mourning . she had emerged from misery , and she was entering into life . [female] had undertaken to teach her to read , sometimes , as he made the child spell . he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison .
to the poor old duke the offence was of a different nature . he had intended to use a very strong word when he told his friend that his proposed conduct would be quixotic . the duke of omnium would surely know that the duke ofbungay could not support a quixotic prime minister . and yet the younger duke , the telemachus of the last two years . after hearing that word , -- had rebelled against his mentor , and had obstinately adhered to his quixotism !
the cramped area of the prison had such an effect on mrs [female] that she began to weep . and such an effect on mr [male] that he began to gasp for air . he was walking up and down the room , panting , and making himself worse by laboriously fanning himself with her handkerchief . when he turned towards the opening door , no other . and in [female] 's arms was an iron box some two feet square .
it would have been very difficult to describe [female] with precision . either now or at any time , nay , from the highest point of view . to precisely describe a human being , the focus of a universe -- how impossible ! but , apart from transcendentalism , there never probably lived a person who was in herself more completely a reductio ad absurdum of attempts to appraise a woman . even externally , by items of face and figure .
but as to the constant going to and fro of busy trades people it would always be widely different from the northern lines . here a spectator or two stood lounging at nearly every station , with his hands in his pockets . so absorbed in the simple act of watching , that it made the travellers wonder what he could find to do when the train whirled away . and only the blank of a railway , some sheds . and a distant field or two were left for him to gaze upon .
after a formal apology for the encroachment , lord glenallan agreed to go with him . and underwent with patience in their return home the whole history of [male] of the girnel . a legend which mr. [male] was never known to spare any one who crossed his threshold . the only inmate of monkbarns who remained entirely indifferent on this momentous occasion was [male] . who cared no more for an earl than he did for a commoner .
her first terror had been so acute that he had failed to see what remained after her fright had passed . but it was clear to him now , and the look that came into his own face told her that he had made the discovery . the beauty of her face , her eyes . her hair -- the wonder of her presence six hundred miles from civilization . had held him spellbound , he had seen only the deep lustre and the wonderful blue of her eyes .
he looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments . carts , guns , artillery , and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road . three and sometimes four abreast , from all sides , behind and before , as far as ear could reach . there were the rattle of wheels , the creaking of carts and gun carriages . the tramp of horses , the crack of whips .
but the man was odious to [male] at that moment . the house was odious , the people and the talk inside were odious . and he slipped away unobserved , he would leave the island . tomorrow he would sail for england . no matter if he lost the chance of promotion .
`` you can not do not try , come into this little park and let [female] talk . '' and drawing her hand through his arm , [female] led her into what to other eyes was a very dismal square . with a boarded up fountain in the middle , sodden grass plots . and dead leaves dancing in the wintry wind . but to them it was a summery paradise .
now i suppose , said accolon , she hath made all these crafts and enchantments for this battle . ye may well believe it , said the dwarf . right so there came a knight and a lady with six squires . and saluted accolon , and prayed him for to arise , and come and rest him at his manor . and so accolon mounted upon a void horse , and went with the knight unto a fair manor by a priory .
fanny 's immediate concerns , as far as they involved mr. [male] . made no part of their conversation , [male] knew what had passed . and from his heart lamented that his sister 's feelings should be so cold towards a man whom he must consider as the first of human characters . but he was of an age to be all for love . and therefore unable to blame ; and knowing her wish on the subject , he would not distress her by the slightest allusion .
he went without a tie for a whole year . and had six shirts made of [male] flannel . he had long refused to take a seat either in a shipping office or in a tea merchant 's warehouse . and persisted , in spite of the disapproval of uncles and aunts . in practicing both violin and piano , with the result that he could not perform professionally upon either .
the lamps were being lit , but the streets were dark enough and empty enough to let him walk his fastest . and to talk aloud as he walked , he had no doubt where he was going . he was going to find [male] datchet . the desire to share what he felt . with some one who understood it , was so imperious that he did not question it .
his head was thrust forward almost aggressively over his instrument , and his eyes glared at the dancing men with the old wolf like gleam . as he played , he drew the bow across with a swift jerk . thrust it back with another , threw his shoulders from one side to the other in abrupt time to the music . and the music , [location] unconsciously shuddered ; then sighed in pity . it was atrocious , it was not even in tune .
madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion . descending from the cab , she approached the door with trembling knees . and rang the bell , three times did the bell ring with a dull . heavy sound , seeming to participate , in the general sadness , before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door . which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard , he saw a lady .
swithin 's heart swelled within him in sudden pity for her , first . then he blanched with a horrified sense of what she had done . and at his own relation to the deed , he felt like an awakened somnambulist who should find that he had been accessory to a tragedy during his unconsciousness . she had loosened the knot of her difficulties by cutting it unscrupulously through and through . the royal observatory was about a mile out of the town .
jan and melisse were happy ; and in the joys of these two there was pleasure for the others of the post . as there had been happiness in the presence of the woman , only upon cummins had there settled a deep grief . the changes of spring and summer . bringing with them all that this desolate world held of warmth and beauty . filled him with the excruciating pain of his great grief .
on this again some may say that when different persons are engaged in doing the same work . we find that they accomplish the same end or purpose . while , on the contrary , in the case of men and women we find that each of them accomplishes his or her own end separately . and this is inconsistent , but this is a mistake , for we find that sometimes two things are done at the same time . as for instance in the fighting of rams .
late in the afternoon she sought refuge with mademoiselle reisz . and stayed there alone , waiting for her , feeling a kind of repose invade her with the very atmosphere of the shabby . unpretentious little room , edna seated herself at the piano . and softly picked out with one hand the bars of a piece of music which lay open before her . a half hour went by , there was the occasional sound of people going and coming in the lower hall .
two days after a cab stood in the yard in front of the kitchen window . peggy 's luggage was being piled upon it . two large , handsome basket boxes with the initials painted on them . kneeling on the box seat , the coachman leaned over the roof making room for another . a small box covered with red cowhide and tied with a rough rope .
for seven or eight miles the level sands were as short and far more agreeable a road than the up and down land ways . [male] walked on pretty briskly , unconsciously enjoying the sunny landscape before him . the crisp curling waves rushing almost up to his feet . on his right hand , and then swishing back over the fine small pebbles into the great swelling sea . to his left were the cliffs rising one behind another , having deep gullies here and there between .
and again there was hope , a wild , almost unbelievable hope that with nada he might find that place which yellow bird . the sorceress , had promised for them -- that mystery place of safety and of happiness which she had called the country beyond . where `` all would end well , '' he had not the faith of yellow bird 's people . he was not superstitious enough to believe fully in her sorcery , except that he seized upon it as a drowning man might grip at a floating sea weed . yet was the under current of hope so persistent that at times it was near faith .
happily , it was soon demonstrated that the cuisine was being maintained on its erstwhile plane of excellence . one still had that comfort ... other impressions , less ultimate , proved puzzling . disconcerting , and paradoxically reassuring , lanyard commanded a fair view of roddy across the waist of the room . the detective had ordered a meal that matched his aspect well . both of true british simplicity , he was a square set man with a square jaw .
what else was there for me to do , my friend ? if i had killed myself it would have burdened your life . which ought to be happy , with a needless remorse ; and then , what is the good of killing oneself when one is so near dying already ? now i am seriously ill , i have written to the duke to ask him for money . for i have none , and the creditors have returned . and come to me with their bills with pitiless perseverance .
not a voice was raised in that more distant part of the zaouïa where the students lived . and where the poor were lodged and fed for charity 's sake , no doubt the village . across the narrow river in its wide bed , was buzzing with life at this time of day . but seldom any sound there was loud enough to break the slumberous silence of the great zaouïa . and the singing of the men in the near oasis who fought the sand .
let me advise all philosophers suffering from world sickness to take a long sea voyage with a woman like miss west . in this narrative i shall call her `` miss west '' no more , she has ceased to be miss west . she is [female] , i do not think of her as miss west . i think of her as [female] . it is a pretty word , a woman word .
they were entering the desolation of the hills . on the sides of the thin strip of valley . down which he pursued her , there were great , dark rocks . as big as cottages along a village street . he shouted , calling her name , fearful that he should lose her in this broken country in the fast deepening night .
but i have lately been finding out that it is your shallow lover who can not help making a declaration . if [female] 's ways were less distracting , and it were less of a heaven to be in her presence and watch her . i must long ago have flung myself at her feet , and requested her to tell me . with less indirectness , whether she wished me to blow my brains out . i have a knack of hoping .
gwendolen , who was fond of her mamma . felt hurt and ashamed , and had never since dared to ask a question about her father . on this day of arrival at [female] . which not even mrs. [female] had seen before -- the place having been taken for her by her brother in law . mr. [male] -- when all had got down from the carriage , and were standing under the porch in front of the open door .
he drew his body to its height . and leaned heavily upon the table , i snatched a candle and bent toward him to make sure my eyes were not tricking me . he was evidently dazed by whatever had occurred , and i sprang around and helped him to a couch . he would not lie down but sat up , staring and passing his hand over his head . it was rapidly growing lighter , and i saw a purple and [male] streak across his temple where a bludgeon of some sort had struck him .
but he had told himself so often that anything was better than a pecuniary obligation . that he was determined to speak his mind to mrs. [female] . and to beg her to allow him to have his way , so he waited till the [male] smiths were gone . and sir raffle buffle . and then , when [male] was apart with [male] , -- for [male] had left them .
so balin and the damosel rode into a forest . and there met with a knight that had been a hunting , and that knight asked balin for what cause he made so great sorrow . me list not to tell you , said balin . now , said the knight , an i were armed as ye be i would fight with you . that should little need , said balin , i am not afeard to tell you .
a fortnight had passed over and winter was advancing with rapid strides . in bleak northern farmsteads there was much to be done before november weather should make the roads too heavy for half fed horses to pull carts through . there was the turf , pared up on the distant moors , and left out to dry . to be carried home and stacked ; the brown fern was to be stored up for winter bedding for the cattle . for straw was scarce and dear in those parts ; even for thatching , heather was used .
`` mordieu , you are an absolute set of fools , '' cried the minister , darting out of the carriage ; and before the subaltern had time to shut the gate . [male] sprang through it , and ran forward in spite of the soldier . who cried out for assistance , [male] gained ground . regardless of the cries of the man , who , however , having at last come up with [male] .
at length , being quite at the end of my money . and seeing no other help for it , i determined to listen to clerks no more . but force my way up to the justices , and insist upon being heard by them . or discharged from my recognisance , for so they had termed the bond or deed which i had been forced to execute . in the presence of a chief clerk or notary , the very day after i came to [location] .
`` is she her mother ? '' `` yes , truly , sire . '' certainly , i may then well say that fair and comely should be the flower born of so fair a stem . and better the fruit one picks ; for sweet is the smell of what springs from good . fair is enide and fair she should be in all reason and by right . for her mother is a very handsome lady , and her father is a goodly knight .
mrs. [female] had her own method of interpreting her nieces . she decided that [female] was a little hysterical , and was trying to gain time by a torrent of talk . feeling very diplomatic , she lamented the fate of speyer . and declared that never , never should she be so misguided as to visit it . and added of her own accord that the principles of restoration were ill understood in [location] .
thryng also dreamed , but not in sleep , his mind was stirred to unusual depths by his strange surroundings . the silence , the mystery , the beauty of the night . and the suggestions of grandeur and power dimly revealed by the moonlight which bathed the world in a flood of glory . he was uplifted and drawn out of himself , and at the same time he was thrown back to review his life and to see his most inward self . and to marvel and question the wherefore of it all , why was he here .
the banks meeting behind were bare of a hedge . save such as was formed by disconnected tufts of furze , standing upon stems along the top . like impaled heads above a city wall . a white mast , fitted up with spars and other nautical tackle . could be seen rising against the dark clouds whenever the flames played brightly enough to reach it .
the funeral was detestable , afterwards , at the tea table , the daughters kept saying . 'he was a good father to us . the best father in the world ' -- or else -- 'we sha not easily find another man as good as father was . [male] acquiesced in all this , it was the right conventional attitude . and , as far as the world went , he believed in the conventions .
he was a good-looking man , of fashionable appearance . and the young lady who attended him noticed him and was courteous to him . he condescended even to have a little light conversation with her . and , on the whole , he seemed to enjoy his breakfast . upon my word , i should like to breakfast here every day of my life , ', he said .
the door opened , a singular and violent group made its appearance on the threshold . three men were holding a fourth man by the collar . the three men were gendarmes ; the other was [male] . a brigadier of gendarmes , who seemed to be in command of the group . was standing near the door , he entered and advanced to the bishop .
countless houses studded the steep mountain slope . and many people were discerned walking and riding along the narrow , ledge like streets which wound toward the summit . far up in the clouds , clearly and distinctly could be seen the grim monastery . perched at the very pinnacle of the mountain , several miles away . up there it looked bleak and cold and uninviting , in great contrast to the loveliness and warmth of the valley .
but he persisted that she did not see all -- that she did not see as much as he . his daughter 's not writing was only one part of his worry . on account of her he was anxious concerning money affairs . which he would never alarm his mind about otherwise , the reason he gave was that . as she had nobody to depend upon for a provision but himself .
lidia ivanovna 's dress had cost her great pains . as indeed all her dresses had done of late , her aim in dress was now quite the reverse of that she had pursued thirty years before . then her desire had been to adorn herself with something . and the more adorned the better , now , on the contrary , she was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with her age and her figure . that her one anxiety was to contrive that the contrast between these adornments and her own exterior should not be too appalling .
`` yes , i would forgotten it , here it is , '' and the younger man handed back the envelope -- this time using his left hand . later in the analysis of retrospect stuart began to wonder at his host 's strange behavior until of idle speculation suspicion was born . but as to that circumstance he held his counsel . the last summer month brings to the cape the august twister and the august tide .
[female] , the maid , was also negative , from her stupid round . moist face to the shapeless feet that she never seemed to be able to lift from the floor . she had acquired great dexterity in shuffling out of the way just before mr. [male] appeared . this she seemed to have reduced to a fine art , if mr. [male] were going upstairs and [male] was about to descend . by the time he was halfway up she would have disappeared as effectively as if snatched away by some spirit agency .
marius , up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy , and to asides . both by habit and by taste , was a little fluttered by this covey of young men around him . all these various initiatives solicited his attention at once , and pulled him about . the tumultuous movements of these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl . sometimes , in his trouble , they fled so far from him .
`` it will just be better than nobody at all to be along with her . '' the vicar was now going down to the mill to give his assent to this . he could see nothing better , [female] at any rate would be firm . would not be prevented by false shame from being a very sister to her sister . and would perhaps be admitted where a brother 's attendance might be refused , he had promised to see the women at the mill as early in the week as he could .
lady rowley also was disappointed and unhappy , she had expected so much pleasure from her visit to her daughter . and she had received so little , [female] 's condition was very sad . but in her heart of hearts perhaps she groaned more bitterly over all that [female] had lost . than she did over the real sorrows of her elder child . to have had the cup at her lip , and then not to have tasted it !
the one friend of her childhood had come back , the one link . the almost forgotten link , that bound her to every day dream of those foolish early days . was united once more by the presence of the young soldier , all that happy time . nearly five years ago , -- that happy time in which the tennis court had been built . and the boat house by the river restored , -- those sunny autumn days before her father 's second marriage .
men of their precarious course of life change readily from the banquet to the battle . and , to [male] , the exchange seemed but a succession of pleasure . he called for his helmet and the most cumbrous parts of his armour . which he had laid aside ; and while gurth was putting them on . he laid his strict injunctions on wilfred , under pain of his highest displeasure .
sometimes , however , as in the affair of the assassins of petit jean , the headsman of [location] . and in that of emery [male] , the murderer of [male] . justice overleaped the church and passed on to the execution of its sentences . but unless by virtue of a decree of parliament . woe to him who violated a place of asylum with armed force !
he could not now advance many steps , without spying eyes to track and denounce him . her own helplessness struck her with the terrible sense of utter disappointment . the possibility of being the slightest use to her husband had become almost nil . and her only hope rested in being allowed to share his fate . whatever it might ultimately be , for the moment , even her chance of ever seeing the man she loved again .
at breakfast , mr [male] likewise appeared , as the old gentleman inhabited the highest story of the palace . where he might have practised pistol shooting without much chance of discovery by the other inmates . his younger niece had taken courage to propose the restoration to him of his clarionet . which mr [male] had ordered to be confiscated , but which she had ventured to preserve . notwithstanding some objections from miss [female] , that it was a low instrument .
he accompanied her downstairs . and through the courts and passages to the place where she had left her cab . in spite of the ticket porter , who was hanging about ready to act as escort . he saw her safely seated in the hackney vehicle . and then walked slowly back to his chambers , thinking over the interview which had just concluded .
the arrest produced no sensation , indeed was almost unknown , and scarcely interrupted the course of events . to the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it . [female] , it was admitted to the presence of [female] . who , silent and lofty as ever , listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies . but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say .
from the thickest parts of the copse , where the snow still remained . came the faint sound of narrow winding threads of water running away . tiny birds twittered , and now and then fluttered from tree to tree , in the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last year 's leaves . stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of the grass , imagine ! one can hear and see the grass growing , levin said to himself .
jill remained where she was , leaning with one hand against the switchboard . she made no attempt to follow the directions he had given her . she was aware of a sense of comradeship . of being with this man in this adventure , if he stayed . she must stay , to go now through the safety of the stage door would be abominable desertion .
he joined a handful and stood talking to them . but he reached the crossroads before the ammunition train . the crossroads was crowded , as usual -- many soldiers , at rest . waiting for the word to fall in , a battery held up by the breaking of a wheel . a temporary forge had been set up , and soldiers in leather aprons were working over the fire .
the big business man continued stamping violently upon the rug . joined now by the very young man , the doctor sat on the floor beside it , breathing heavily . the banker lay in a heap at its foot in utter collapse . as they stamped , the rug continued to flatten down ; it sank under their tread with a horrible . sickening , squashing sound , `` let 's look , ''
such being our chief scene , the date of our story refers to a period towards the end of the reign of [male] . when his return from his long captivity had become an event rather wished than hoped for by his despairing subjects . who were in the meantime subjected to every species of subordinate oppression . the nobles , whose power had become exorbitant during the reign of [male] . and whom the prudence of [male] the second had scarce reduced to some degree of subjection to the crown .
an observation here becomes necessary , in view of the pages which the reader is about to peruse . and of others which will be met with further on , may we , then , be permitted to speak of the past in the present ? that said , we beg the reader to take note of it . and we continue , [organization] instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets . taking the most intricate lines which he could devise , returning on his track at times .
it had all occurred in such an incredible short space of time that she could not yet realize what had happened . her heart and brain seemed paralyzed , her limbs stiff and immovable . like the dizzy whirl of a kaleidoscope , the picture before her resolved itself into shape . the beast was gasping his last upon the rocky floor , the hilt of the goat hunter 's dagger protruding from his side . baldos , supported by two of his men , stood above the savage victim .
it was plain that i could look for no help or mercy from wolf larsen . whatever was to be done i must do for myself ; and out of the courage of fear i evolved the plan of fighting [male] with his own weapons . i borrowed a [male] from johansen . [male] , the boat steerer , had already begged me for condensed milk and sugar . the lazarette , where such delicacies were stored , was situated beneath the cabin floor .
mr. [male] began by regretting the hardness of his position . in that he must , with what thoroughness he might be able to achieve . apply himself to two great subjects , whereas the right honourable gentleman opposite had already declared . with all the formality which could be made to attach itself to a combined meeting of peers and commoners . that he would confine himself strictly to one , the subject selected by the right honourable gentleman opposite on the present occasion was not the question of church reform .
and it seemed to [female] that her [female] had told her everything in that hour and a half that they had been together . she had given a whole history of her husband and of herself . she had said how indifferent he was to her pleasures . and how vainly she strove to interest herself in his pursuits . and then , as yet , she was childless and without prospect of a child .
nor was he alone , for all around lay the dust of his kindred , come after the toil and struggle of their stormy lives to rest within the walls of that old church . some of them had monuments of alabaster . whereon they lay in effigy . their heads pillowed upon that of a conquered saracen ; some had monuments of oak and brass . and some had no monuments at all , for the puritans had ruthlessly destroyed them .
thus it was that [female] , when she came out to the veranda step . found herself unaccountably deserted , all the grange penhallows were gone . [female] realized this after a few moments of bewildered seeking , and she understood that if she were to get to the grange that night she must walk . plainly there was nobody to take her , [female] was angry , it is not [female] to find yourself forgotten and neglected . it is still less [female] to walk home alone along a country road .
this implicit falsehood passed through her mind as she remembered that the czarina was [female] 's hotel . but she was then already far up the obere strasse , and she walked on with her usual floating movement . every line in her figure and drapery falling in gentle curves attractive to all eyes except those which discerned in them too close a resemblance to the serpent . and objected to the revival of serpent worship , she looked neither to the right hand nor to the left . and transacted her business in the shop with a coolness which gave little mr. [female] nothing to remark except her proud [female] of manner .
how they look and move and speak and behave , always in the setting i have found for them . is my account of them -- of which i dare say . alas , que [male] manque souvent d'architecture . but i would rather , i think , have too little architecture than too much . when there 's danger of its interfering with my measure of the truth .
only jolly [male] could tell the story of how [female] 's mother had died for a woman . and in this moment it must have been that her spirit entered into [male] 's soul . for the pain of his terrible hurt was forgotten in his desire to drag himself back to the feet of the girl . and die facing her enemy -- the man , he did not know that he was dragging his broken body only an inch at a time through the sand . but the girl saw the terrible truth , and with a cry of agony which all of hawkin 's torture could not have wrung from her she ran to him .
but he shook himself together into the shape of resolution . however slight and transient , `` i must do something i intended to do , '' he said . between his set teeth , and pushed on up through the via guicciardini . `` i will go to the boboli because i said i would . '' when he entered the beautiful old garden , its benison of [male] fell upon his tumult .
today is the 15th december , i have been ill three or four days . this morning i stayed in bed . the weather is dark , i am sad ; there is no one by me . i think of you , armand , and you , where are you . while i write these lines ? far from [location] , far , far , they tell me .
good fellow , in conundrums you are speaking . sing hey , the mystic sailor that you are . the answer to them vainly i am seeking ; sing hey . the [male] maiden and the tar . both the [male] maiden and the tar .
there was neither health nor gaiety in [female] in a town . she sat in a blaze of oppressive heat . in a cloud of moving dust , and her eyes could only wander from the walls . marked by her father 's head , to the table cut and notched by her brothers . where stood the tea board never thoroughly cleaned , the cups and saucers wiped in streaks .
`` pace to him now , '' said the sailor . as he crossed himself , and went over a prayer . the wind now raged fearfully ; claps , like the report of cannon . struck the frail boat at intervals . and laid her nearly keel uppermost ; while the mast bent like a whip .
true , he had graduated from the high school before entering his father 's real estate and insurance office . but his geographical experiences had been limited to three or four railway excursions . at special rates , to such points of interest as mammoth cave and [location] , [location] . his other experiences were not more sparkling , and except for the emotions within him . he was in all the qualities of his mind as well as in his bodily contours and the apparel sheltering the latter .
from what it could arise , and where it would end , were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm . the manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil , hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience . or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling . of two days , the earliest fixed on , and of that almost the earliest hour . as if resolved to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning , that he might not be obliged even to see her .
the house was not [male] 's -- that i guessed . he was hardly the man to become a proprietor . i more than suspected in him a lamentable absence of the saving faculty . he could get , but not keep ; he needed a treasurer . the tenement , then , belonged to a citizen in the basse ville .
the father and mother , detected one day in one of their criminal enterprises . suddenly vanished into that obscurity in which the penal laws envelop convicted malefactors . the child , too , disappeared , [male] , in his wanderings about the world . stumbled , one day , on an adventurer like himself . helped him out of some scrape ; rendered him a kindly service .
`` but certainly , of course , she must go there , '' he said . still speaking laboriously , then after that effort , as if exhausted , he relapsed into silence . but mademoiselle therèse pursued the idea , and before the meal was over had fixed a day in the following week for the excursion . as her sister had already been at the mont more than once , it was decided she should remain with [female] . so that the [female] task of accompanying [male] fell .
she must be obeyed , was the first distinct idea which waked him from his reverie . and he hastened to the place by which he had entered the pavilion . to pass under the canvas in the manner he had entered required time and attention . and he made a readier aperture by slitting the canvas wall with his poniard . when in the free air , he felt rather stupefied and overpowered by a conflict of sensations .
[male] heard of the old lady 's illness and came out to spencervale himself . he was not allowed to see the old lady , of course . but he told all concerned that no expense or trouble was to be spared . and the spencervale doctor was instructed to send his bill to [male] and hold his [male] about it . moreover , when [male] went back home , he sent a trained nurse out to wait on the old lady .
she asked it so anxiously , that if he had been in possession of any kind of tenement . he would have had it plastered a foot deep rather than answer no . but he was obliged to answer no ; and he saw a shade of disappointment on her face . as she checked a sigh , and looked at the low fire . then he saw , also , that mrs [female] was a young woman .
but , -- and mr. [male] shrugged his shoulders as he spoke , when a nobleman like the duke chooses to have a way of his own . he must have it , mr. [male] went on to declare that any further candidature would be waste of money . waste of time , and waste of energy . and then signified his intention of retiring , as far as this election went , into private life .
the king was not interested , and wanted to move along , but i was absorbed . and full of pity , i could not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity . there they sat , grounded upon the ground , silent , uncomplaining . with bowed heads , a pathetic sight , and by hideous contrast . a redundant orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty steps away .
the only joy that had been left for [male] arundel after his retirement from the east [location] company 's service was this fierce delight of vengeance . he had drained the intoxicating cup to the dregs . and had been drunken at first in the sense of his triumph , but he was sober now . and he paced up and down the neglected garden beneath a chill october sky . crunching the fallen leaves under his feet , with his arms folded and his head bent .
all he asked of her , as yet , was a touch on the hand or on the lips . and that she should let him go on lying there through the long warm hours . while a black bird 's song throbbed like a fountain . and the summer wind stirred in the trees . and close by , between the nearest branches and the brim of his tilted hat .
but he knew mother 's way of sticking to an idea . and he began to persuade himself that saserkopee was a haven of refuge . whenever they seemed to be having a peaceful discussion of lulu [location] 's canary yellow sweater . they were hearing her voice , wondering if they could tolerate its twangy comments the rest of their lives . there were two or three october days when the sea was blue and silver .
in his search for wealth , he had been content to abide his time . he did not want the trifling sum that every [location] policeman acquires . his object was something bigger , and he was prepared to wait for it . he knew that small beginnings were an annoying but unavoidable preliminary to all great fortunes . probably , captain [male] had started in a small way , certainly , mr. [male] had .
the exposure of nugent 's perfidy . the revelation of the fatal secret of oscar 's face . and , last not least , the defence of my own conduct towards her . were all comprehended in the answer for which that question called , as carefully , as delicately . as mercifully as i could , i disclosed to her the whole truth , how the shock affected her .
he said , `` she made him good '' our child of [male] , he would sit . gazing on her almost as if she were his guardian angel . his patron saint , and the little maid in her quiet way was very fond of him . delighting in his company when her father was not by , but no one ever was to her like her father .
but his attention was quickly called from the beauties of inanimate nature . to objects more interesting ; for he observed two persons . whom he instantly recollected to be the same that he had formerly pursued over the plains . they were seated on the margin of the lake . under the shade of some high trees at the foot of the rocks .
never had he seen kedsty 's face more like the face of an emotionless sphinx . but what [male] him most was the presence of people he had not expected . close behind kedsty was mcdougal , the magistrate , and behind mcdougal entered constables felly and brant . stiffly erect and clearly under orders , cardigan , pale and uneasy . came in last , with the stenographer , scarcely had they entered the room when constable pelly pronounced the formal warning of the criminal code of the royal northwest mounted police .
dinah dusted up to the very edge of these and then hesitated , looking at them with a longing but timid eye . it was painful to see how much dust there was among them . as she was looking in this way , she heard [female] 's step just outside the open door . towards which her back was turned , and said , raising her clear treble , [male] . is your brother wrathful when his papers are stirred ?
the waking traveller , therefore , stole a little nearer , and yet a little nearer . and a little nearer to the sleeping traveller 's bed . until he stood close beside it , even then he could not see his face . for he had drawn the sheet over it . the regular breathing still continuing , he put his smooth white hand ( such a treacherous hand it looked .
from time to time there fell a silence . and their souls , delivered from mere words ( it was not the meaning in the words that interested them but their breath of life . like the furtive contacts between quivering antennae ) their souls pursued another dialogue more solemn and profound . the dreams in the colored windows , the shadows cast by the piers . the droning of the hymns mingled with their dream .
when the hedges are full of trailing brambles , loaded with ripe blackberries . when the air is full of the farewell whistles and pipes of birds . clear and short -- not the long full throated warbles of spring ; when the whirr of the partridge 's wings is heard in the stubble fields . as the sharp hoof blows fall on the paved lanes ; when here and there a leaf floats and flutters down to the ground . although there is not a single breath of wind , the country surgeon felt the beauty of the seasons perhaps more than most men .
throughout the day he longed for the night . that he might close his eyes in the darkness and think of [male] . he tried to think of her as she used to be . bright , happy , winsome , full of joy , of love , of passion . dangling her feet from the apple tree , or tripping along the tree trunk in the glen , teasing him , tempting him .
friedhelm [female] took the rest of the proceedings into his own hands . and distributed the presents exactly as if he had found them all growing on the tree . and had not the least idea what they were nor whence they came . a doll which fell to the share of the little [male] was from [male] . as i found from the lively demonstrations that took place .
`` what else have you been spunging ? '' said maria , half pleased that [organization] should be so complimented . `` spunging , my dear , it is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants '' eggs , which mrs. [female] would quite force upon me . she would not take a denial , she said it must be such an amusement to me . as she understood i lived quite alone , to have a few living creatures of that sort .
and then , also , sir [male] was the richest man in the county . and to county practitioners a new patient with large means is a godsend . how much greater a godsend when he be not only acquired , but taken also from some rival practitioner . need hardly be explained , dr fillgrave , therefore , was somewhat elated when , after a very early breakfast . he stepped into the post chaise which was to carry him to boxall hill .
at that moment , the mother who was crouching on the pavement . opened her eyes wide , without uttering a cry . she raised herself erect with a terrible expression . then she flung herself upon the hand of the executioner . like a beast on its prey , and bit it .
philip answered the letter in person . something had been speaking to him day and night . like the humming of a top , finding him pretexts on which to go . but now he had to make excuses for staying so long away , it was evening . [male] was milking , and he went out to her in the cowhouse .
the weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air . at two o'clock the tennis balls began , according to [female] 's directions . to take the direction of the moat , much to the joy of [female] ramee . who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat . and very soon balls were wanting , so many had gone over , [male] ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up .
across the swamp came a repetition of his notes from another of his kind . so the brown streak moved in that direction , at its next pause its voice arose again . sweeter for the mellowing distance . and then another bird , not so far away , answered , the bird replied and came winging in sight . this time peering , uttering a short note .
he was shown in directly ; he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued . in two hours [location] would be under arms . deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards . named comminges , made his appearance , with his clothes all torn . his face streaming with blood , the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on .
the letter was from sir [male] ; an angry one , revealing strong suspicions of his agent 's dishonesty . and announcing that he should be at the grange on the fifth of the month . to make a close investigation of all matters connected with the bailiff 's administration . it was a letter that gave little hope of mercy . and [female] felt that it was so , she saw that there were no two sides to the question .
on his right ran the derwent , sucking softly among his sedges . on this side and that lay the flat bottom through which he went . meadowland broken by rushes ; his mare cecily stepped along , now cracking the thin ice of the little pools with her dainty feet . now going gently over peaty ground , blowing thin clouds from her red nostrils . yet unencouraged by word or caress from her rider .
she had had horses for three days . not a fortnight before , and had comfortably `` killed off '' all her acquaintances . who might now put themselves to trouble and expense in their turn . yet [female] was too far off for her to walk ; and she had repeatedly questioned her son as to whether his wish that she should call on the hales was strong enough to bear the expense of cab hire . she would have been thankful if it had not ; for , as she said .
`` it was not i as forgot you , '' said sylvia , so softly as not to be heard by him , he tried to make her repeat what she had said . but she would not , and he could only conjecture that it was something more tell-tale than she liked to say again . and that alone was very charming to him , `` i shall walk home with you , '' said he , as sylvia at last rose to depart , warned by a further glimpse of [female] 's angry face .
[male] knew how to write such a letter , by the writing of such letters . and by the making of speeches in the same strain . he had become bishop of barchester . now , in this letter , he begged [male] to come over to him . saying how delighted mrs. [female] would be to see him at the palace .
but the next day , she did not come , she sent a note that she was kept indoors by a cold . here was a torment , but he possessed his soul in some sort of patience . writing a brief answer , telling her how sorry he was not to see her . the day after this , he stayed at home . it seemed so futile to go down to the office , his father could not live the week out .
yes , one hundred a year , do you think that any man in his proper senses would marry [male] on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year ? well , my uncle 's kindness can never be requited , if such goodness as his does not make [female] miserable . then she will never deserve to be happy , yes , here they are , i will go to the library . i can receive their congratulations later , you know i am prodigiously fond of wickham , lizzy . i defy even sir [male] himself to produce a more valuable son in law .
charley [male] was a master now . in another school , under another head , it was evening . and [male] was walking in his garden observed from behind a blind by gentle little miss [female] . who contemplated offering him a loan of her smelling salts for headache . when [female] , in faithful attendance , held up her arm .
was he not deceiving himself ? was he not wrong , alas ! it was all miss crawford 's doing , she had seen her influence in every speech . and was miserable , the doubts and alarms as to her own conduct . which had previously distressed her , and which had all slept while she listened to him . were become of little consequence now , this deeper anxiety swallowed them up .
they had come to a gradual turn in the road at a point where a steep . wooded incline swept up on the left , on the right lay the old hunting preserve and armitage 's bungalow . as they drew into the curve they heard a revolver crack twice . as before , followed by answering shots and cries and the thump of hoofs , ohee ! oscar has struck them again , steady now , watch your horse !
as soon as her father had gone , [female] rose and suggested that if colonel [male] had done his wine they should go into the drawing room . which they [male] did , this room was much more modern than either the vestibule or the dining room . and had an air and flavour of nineteenth century young lady about it . there were the little tables , the draperies , the photograph frames . and all the hundred and one knick knacks and odds and ends by means of which a lady of taste makes a chamber lovely in the eyes of brutal man .
she must not go back , her father would curse her . and perhaps beat her mother and her too , ah , he would not dare to strike her again . and the girl 's face flushed with shameful remembrance . and her little brothers and sisters would cry if she came back . they had little enough to eat as it was , of course she must not go back .
a part of the afternoon he spent on shore . he filled a moosehide bag full of sand and suspended it from the limb of a tree . and for three quarters of an hour pommeled it with his fists . much to the curiosity and amusement ofpierre 's men . who could see nothing of man fighting in these antics .
fitzpiers did not pursue his questioning , in the moonlight [male] looked very beautiful . the scratches and blemishes incidental to her out door occupation being invisible under these pale rays . while they remain silent the coarse whir of the eternal night jar burst sarcastically from the top of a tree at the nearest corner of the wood . besides this not a sound of any kind reached their ears . the time of nightingales being now past , and hintock lying at a distance of two miles at least .
she merely kept the boat before the stream now . and rested on her oars , knowing well that if the face were not soon visible . it had gone down , and she would overshoot it . an untrained sight would never have seen by the moonlight what she saw at the length of a few strokes astern . she saw the drowning figure rise to the surface .
no one knew much of what was passing in sylvia ; she did not know herself . sometimes in the nights she would waken , crying , with a terrible sense of desolation . every one who loved her , or whom she had loved , had vanished out of her life . every one but her child , who lay in her arms , warm and soft . but then [female] foster 's words came upon her .
she could not understand what it all meant ; but one thing she understood . that in some way this old dead woman , [female] adams . had gotten immortal youth and beauty in one human heart . `` she looked to him just as she did when she was a girl , '' [female] kept thinking to herself with awe , she said nothing about it to mrs. [female] or her daughters .
at about nine o'clock at night , on every alternate wednesday . miss [female] made the same resolve , that she would never again lend her rooms for any purposes whatsoever . being , as they were , rather large and conveniently situated in a street mostly dedicated to offices off the strand . people who wished to meet , either for purposes of enjoyment . or to discuss art , or to reform the state , had a way of suggesting that [female] had better be asked to lend them her rooms .
i told her that i did not practise as an advocate . and that i had no experience whatever of divorce proceedings . not having been taught the subject in the schools , then she began to speak in a very solemn voice . she said she had never expected me to take up her case . but had sought me out because she had been informed that the advocates with whom i had served my articles were very eminent practitioners .
and standing there by the fire , they bowed their heads in a new thanksgiving to him whose keeping never fails by day or night . and then , with hearts and voices subdued , and with quiet good nights . they went their ways home . but as the cameron sleigh drove off with its load , maimie looked back . and seeing ranald standing by the fire .
first , of course , [female] muxworthy . teaching me how to draw the sledd , as if she had been born in it . and flourishing with a great broom , wherever a speck of snow lay . then dear annie , and old molly ( who was very quiet , and counted almost for nobody ) . and behind them , mother , looking as if she wanted to come first .
d'artagnan rode slowly past its walls . measured its towers with his eye and descended into the valley . from afar he looked down upon the chateau of [male] . situated on the shores of a small lake , and contiguous to a magnificent forest . it was the same place we have already had the honor of describing to our readers .
he had hoped that young man was far enough away , ruining himself in a fashionable manner somehow . and here he was in attendance upon clarissa . he remembered how his daughter had said that [female] was sure to meet them in [location] . and his own anger at the suggestion , he would be obliged to be civil to the young man , of course . there was no reason indeed that he should be otherwise than civil -- only that lurking terror in his mind .
nor did the long french windows that opened on the balcony offer him any real hindrance . a penknife quickly removed the dried putty round one small , lozenge shaped pane . then pried out the pane itself ; a hand through this space readily found and turned the latch . a cautious pressure opened the two wings far enough to admit his body . and -- he stood inside the library , he had made no sound .
the number of eight rowers for a lighter had never been exceeded . even for the king , this honor had been paid to [male] le surintendant . more for the sake of haste than of respect . `` what does it mean ? '' said [male] , endeavoring to distinguish beneath the tent . which was already apparent , travelers which the most piercing eye could not yet have succeeded in discovering .
it would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians address to him . based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity , do not the very actions for which the historians praise [male] i ( the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign . his struggle with [male] , the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813 ) . flow from the same sources -- the circumstances of his birth . education , and life -- that made his personality what it was and from which the actions for which they blame him ( the holy alliance .
`` and they made themselves many inventions , '' i began merrily , then paused to sniff the air , i looked hastily at the lantern . it was not smoking , again i sniffed , we sprang together for the ladder . but i raced past her to the deck , a dense volume of smoke was pouring out of the steerage companion way . `` the wolf is not yet dead , '' i muttered to myself as i sprang down through the smoke .
oblivious of the tea , young [male] continued to bite his fingers and to look at his visitor . as long as his visitor continued to glance about the room , finally , he made a start at the teapot . gustily rattled a quantity of tea into it from a canister . and set off for the common kitchen to fill it with hot water . young [male] was some time absent .
`` heaven be praised , '' said the half fainting girl , as she leaned upon the young commander 's proffered arm . and they together approached the house of [female] . maud , with the fleetness of an antelope . had ran by the land path from the spot of the contest . and reached home nearly as quick as the boat containing her father and captain [female] had done .
she was fashionably dressed in blackish green and silver , her hat was brilliant green . like the sheen on an insect , but the brim was soft dark green . a falling edge with fine silver , her coat was dark green . lustrous , with a high collar of grey fur . and great fur cuffs , the edge of her dress showed silver and [female] velvet .
after all there was no hurry , she was only a child . as her behaviour had shown him so often , at the same time he was anxious that she should not forget him . and for this reason he wrote her a number of letters from bermuda . from [location] and barbadoes and other ports on the atlantic station . they were not love letters in any sense of the word .
on the following day , [male] leblanc and his daughter made only a very brief stay in the [location] . they went away while it was still broad daylight . marius followed them to the rue [male] l'ouest . as he had taken up the habit of doing , on arriving at the carriage entrance [male] leblanc made his daughter pass in first . then paused , before crossing the threshold , and stared intently at marius , on the next day they did not come to the [location] .
he dares not hurt you now , with that , the hand was suddenly withdrawn as from a fire . and disappeared in the darkness and the rain , overcome with the mingling of terror and joy . i lay for some time almost insensible , the first thing i remember is the sound of a voice above me . full and low , and strangely reminding me of the sound of a gentle wind amidst the leaves of a great tree . it murmured over and over again : i may love him .
why the fruit was not gathered , as it was evidently ripe , would have puzzled any one not acquainted with the corney family to say . but to them it was always a maxim in practice . if not in precept , `` do nothing today that you can put off till tomorrow , '' and [female] the apples dropped from the trees at any little gust of wind . and lay rotting on the ground until the `` lads '' wanted a supply of pies for supper .
before the reader is introduced to the modest country medical practitioner who is to be the chief personage of the following tale . it will be well that he should be made acquainted with some particulars as to the locality in which . and the neighbours among whom , our doctor followed his profession . there is a county in the west of england not so full of life . indeed , nor so widely spoken of as some of its manufacturing leviathan brethren in the north .
the lines of the buildings being as distinct in the morning air as in an architectural drawing . but jude was far from seeing or criticizing these things ; they were hidden by an indescribable consciousness of [male] 's midnight contiguity . a sense of degradation at his revived experiences with her . of her appearance as she lay asleep at dawn . which set upon his motionless face a look as of one accurst .
this is the manner of a `` winkey , '' which i here set down . lest child of mine , or grandchild . dare to make one on my premises ; if he does . i shall know the mark at once , and score it well upon him . the scholar obtains , by prayer or price .
surely he had stood here before , had seen the court house on its low hill . the row of frame houses in small gardens just across the street . it seemed infinitely long ago , but very real , he even remembered dimly an open place at the other side of the building where the ranchmen tied their horses . to test himself he walked around , yes , it was there . but no horses stood there now , heads drooping , bridle reins thrown loosely over the rail .
`` you , sir knight , '' said he . are also anxious about that silly girl , and we would both rather chatter and drink away a part of the night than keep turning round on our rush mats trying in vain to sleep . is it not so ? huldbrand was well satisfied with the plan . the fisherman obliged him to take the seat of honor vacated by the good old housewife . and both drank and talked together in a manner becoming two honest and trusting men .
i was quite clear in the head by now and understood all that passed , there were one or two people in the hall . but mr. [male] took no heed of them . he bore me quickly upstairs and into his sitting room . there he set me down in an arm chair . and stood opposite to me , he was smiling .
[female] trembled as she entered ; and her emotion was heightened . when she perceived at some distance , through the long perspective of the trees . a large ruinous mansion , the gloom of the surrounding shades partly concealed it from her view . but , as she drew near , each forlorn and decaying feature of the fabric was gradually disclosed . and struck upon her heart a horror such as she had never before experienced .
out from his tent rode great sir [male] . an imposing tower of iron , stately and rigid , his huge spear standing upright in its socket and grasped in his strong hand . his grand horse 's face and breast cased in steel . his body clothed in rich trappings that almost dragged the ground . oh , a most noble picture , a great shout went up , of welcome and admiration .
winter has settled down over the divide again ; the season in which nature recuperates . in which she sinks to sleep between the fruitfulness of autumn and the passion of spring . the birds have gone , the teeming life that goes on down in the long grass is exterminated . the prairie dog keeps his hole , the rabbits run shivering from one frozen garden patch to another and are hard put to it to find frost bitten cabbage stalks . at night the coyotes roam the wintry waste .
my companion and i were not heeded , we stood hand in hand like children who have innocently strayed into a palace . gazing in wonderment , the august life went its way upon its own occasions . and , if we would , we might watch , then the voice . clear and cold , proceeding , as it were , with some story begun before we had strayed into the presence . the whole assembly listening in silence .
as the night was fast falling , and as the moon , being past the full . would not rise early , we held a little council ; a short one , for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find . so , they plied their oars once more , and i looked out for anything like a house . thus we held on , speaking little , for four or five dull miles , it was very cold . and , a collier coming by us , with her galley fire smoking and flaring .
no words that cassandra could come by expressed the stillness . the brightness , the air of expectancy which lay upon the orderly beauty of the grass walks and gravel paths down which they went walking four abreast that sunday afternoon . silently the shadows of the trees lay across the broad [female] . silence wrapt her heart in its folds . the quivering stillness of the butterfly on the half opened flower .
sammy , on her tired pony , approached the lookout on the shoulder of dewey . as they drew near a figure rose quickly from its place on the rock . and , running swiftly along the ledge , concealed itself in the clump of cedars above the trail on the southern side of the mountain . a moment later the almost exhausted horse and his rider passed . and the figure , slipping from the ledge , followed them unobserved down the mountain .
`` oh , i should not think [female] ever looked to practice for a living , '' said mr. [male] , with a slight touch of sarcasm . and there the subject was dropped , mr. [male] was aware that [male] was a proud man . but having very little corresponding fibre in himself , and perhaps too little care about personal dignity . except the dignity of not being mean or foolish , he could hardly allow enough for the way in which [male] shrank .
whether [male] was at times guileful in look and language or not . there was a sound foundation below , his answers , i understood afterwards . evinced both wisdom and integrity , he had managed his affairs well . he had struggled through entanglements ; his fortunes were in the way of retrieval . he proved himself in a position to marry .
what happened in the next few seconds was somewhat of a shock to him . father layonne entered first , and then came inspector kedsty . kent 's eyes shot to the face of the commander of n division . there was scarcely recognition in it , a mere inclination of the head . not enough to call a greeting , was the reply to kent 's nod and salute .
filled with the triumphant delight of gratified malice , [male] went back to the broad greensward by the wizard 's cave . the gentlemen had now left the marquee ; the full moon was rising . round and yellow , on the horizon . like a great globe of molten gold , preparations had already commenced for the return . and the younger members of the party were busy discussing the arrangements of the homeward drive .
i am so sorry to hear about dear [female] , [ to judge. ] but why did not aunt [female] come ? is she ill , too ? oh , it 's in the air . everybody 's talking about it nowadays , so [female] tells me , [female] . but a woman can not pursue her career , she must be pursued by it . otherwise she is unwomanly , ahem , as we passed through the library a while ago .
a staircase with a trap door in the lower room led to the cellar . on the second floor were the lodgings of the hucheloup family . they were reached by a staircase which was a ladder rather than a staircase . and had for their entrance only a private door in the large room on the first floor . under the roof , in two mansard attics .
thenceforth the dust and blood of that unruly epoch passed them by . they dwelt apart from alarms in the green forest where their love began . two old men in the meanwhile enjoyed pensions in great prosperity and [male] . and with perhaps a superfluity of ale and wine . in tunstall [male] , one had been all his life a shipman .
aramis , not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar . apostrophized them rather sharply , [male] wished to restrain him . but it was too late , the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence [male] the equanimity even of the cool [male] . who urged on his horse against one of them , then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch . from which each took a concealed musket ; the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in weapons .
in the meantime miss [location] 's other lover had not been idle . and he also was resolved by no means to give up the battle . it can not be said that mr [male] was not mercenary in his views . but with his desire for the lady 's money was mingled much that was courageous . and something also that was generous , the whole truth had been told to him as plainly as it had been told to mr ball .
but [female] could not or would not give that message to maïeddine , `` go , '' he said , the fire of his old rage flaming again . `` go , you arab dog , '' forgetting the flag of truce in his fury at the insult . maïeddine lifted his rifle and fired ; then , remembering that he had sinned against a code of honour he respected . he stood still , waiting for an answering shot .
he took hold of the candlestick . but stood motionless for a long while , she might already have given him more than [male] had prescribed . but it was excusable in him , that he should forget part of an order . in his present wearied condition , he walked up stairs , candle in hand . not knowing whether he should straightway enter his own room and go to bed , or turn to the patient 's room and rectify his omission .
all the ten noble knights sought to dissuade him from dishonouring himself and from forcing them to jeopard their lives . unarmed as they were , in defending the queen , but sir meliagrance would not yield . and the ten knights of the table round drew their swords and stood manly against the spears and swords of the others . but sir meliagrance had them at great advantage . and anon six of them were smitten to the earth with grimly wounds .
he could never again accept her as his wife . they dared not move her from the cheerless rooms in soho . lovel was sent down to ventnor with lady geraldine and a new nurse . it could do no harm to take him away from his mother for a little while . since she was past the consciousness of his presence .
tess was so wrapt up in this fanciful dream that she seemed not to know how the season was advancing . that the days had lengthened , that lady day was at hand . and would soon be followed by old lady day , the end of her term here . but before the quarter day had quite come , something happened which made tess think of far different matters . she was at her lodging as usual one evening .
soames went out , he mounted , slow and icy . to his picture gallery , and paced among his treasures , outrageous , oh , outrageous ! she was spoiled , ah , and who had spoiled her ? he stood still before the [organization] copy . accustomed to her own way in everything , flower of his life ! and now that she could not have it , he turned to the window for some air .
i took my leave of her in the very crowd , and said to her . as if in haste , `` dear lady [female] , take care of your little sister . '' and so the crowd did as it were thrust me away from her . and that i was obliged unwillingly to take my leave , the hurry in such cases is immediately over . and the place clear as soon as the king is gone by ; but as there is always a great running and clutter just as the king passes .
his activity in [location] was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere . order after order and plan after plan were issued by him from the time he entered [location] till the time he left it . the absence of citizens and of a deputation . and even the burning of [location] , did not disconcert him . he did not lose sight either of the welfare of his army or of the doings of the enemy .
so saying , from the pavement he half rose , slowly , with pain . reclining on his arm , and looking wistfully with wide blue eyes as in a picture . him sir [male] remorsefully regarded through his tears . and would have spoken , but he found not words ; then took with care . and kneeling on one knee , o'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands .
to mademoiselle o. d'este [female] , -- my heart tells me that you were the woman so carefully veiled and disguised . and seated between [female] and madame latournelle . who have but one child , a son , ah , my love . if you have only a modest station , without distinction . without importance , without money even , you do not know how happy that would make me .
kitty answered that nothing had happened between them , and that she could not tell why [female] pavlovna seemed displeased with her . [female] answered perfectly truly , she did not know the reason [female] pavlovna had changed to her . but she guessed it , she guessed at something which she could not tell her mother . which she did not put into words to herself . it was one of those things which one knows but which one can never speak of even to oneself .
he was thinking of olivia as he walked slowly up and down the bare platform . only separated by a rough wooden paling from the flat open fields on the outskirts of kemberling . the life which [female] and her stepmother led at [female] towers after poor [female] 's death was one of those tranquil and monotonous existences that leave very little to be recorded . except the slow progress of the weeks and months . the gradual changes of the seasons , [female] bore her sorrows quietly .
i was silent , my heart burned ; my tongue longed to utter ardent words . but i remembered his sad smile as he said , `` you shrink from that , '' and i braced myself to silence , the thing seemed to me altogether so pitiable . and yet -- and yet , i had sworn , but how had he lived out these five terrible years ? by and by [organization] , we all met once more , i felt every hour more like one in a dream or in some impossible old romance .
at the big house pete asked for the master . the english footman , in scarlet knee breeches , left him to wait in the stone hall . the place was very quiet and rather cold , but all as clean as a gull 's wing . there was a dark table in the middle and a high backed chair against the wall . two oil pictures faced each other from opposite sides .
at every meeting her beauty came home afresh to him with the old thrill of glad surprise . in the intervals of absence it seemed to him that she could not possibly be as beautiful as he remembered her . and then when they met she seemed even more so , he learned to watch for the undisguised light of welcome that always leaped into her eyes at the sound of his footsteps . she was nearly always there before him and she always showed that she was glad to see him with the [female] delight of a child watching for a dear comrade . she was never in the same mood twice , now she was grave .
and i had the key of this woman 's room . and in three or four hours she would again be mine , people blame those who let themselves be ruined by actresses and kept women . what astonishes me is that twenty times greater follies are not committed for them . one must have lived that life , as i have . to know how much the little vanities which they afford their lovers every day help to fasten deeper into the heart .
the music , the scent of the lilies on the altar . the vision of the cloud of tulle and orange blossoms floating nearer and nearer . the sight of mrs. [female] 's face suddenly convulsed with happy sobs . the low benedictory murmur of the rector 's voice . the ordered evolutions of the eight pink bridesmaids and the eight [male] ushers .
the poor lonely untaught child looked right and left for some anchorage on the blank sea of life . and could find nothing but floating masses of ocean verdure . that drifted her here and there at the wild will of all the winds of heaven . behind her there was a past that she dared not look back upon or remember . before her lay the unknown future , wrapped in mysterious shadow .
`` hullo , glennard , '' a voice said . as an electric car , late that afternoon , dropped him at an uptown corner . he looked up and met the interrogative smile of [organization] . who stood on the curbstone watching the retreating car with the eye of a man philosophic enough to remember that it will be followed by another . glennard felt his usual impulse of pleasure at meeting flamel .
[female] tour occasionally read aloud some affecting history of the old or new testament . her auditors reasoned but little upon these sacred volumes , for their theology centred in a feeling of devotion towards the supreme being . like that of nature : and their morality was an active principle . like that of the gospel , these families had no particular days devoted to pleasure . and others to sadness , every day was to them a holyday .
a man of genius finds in the consciousness of his talent and in the solidity of his fame an arena of his own . where his legitimate pride can expand and exercise itself without interfering with others . moreover , his perpetual struggle with men and things leave them no time for the coxcombry of fashionable genius . which makes haste to gather in the harvests of a fugitive season . and whose vanity and self love are as petty and exacting as a custom house which levies tithes on all that comes in its way .
monk took up a pen , wrote a single line . signed it , folded the paper , sealed the letter with the seal of his ring . and handed over the missive to [male] , saying , [male] . carry , if you please , this letter to king [male] . and set out immediately , if nothing detains you here any longer .
we know that , in general , [female] was not wanting in ideas . and during this soliloquy , [male] buttoned his vest up to the chin . and nothing excited his imagination like this preparation for a combat of any kind . called accinction by the romans , he was quite heated when he reached the mansion of the duke of [location] . he was introduced to the viceroy with a promptitude which proved that he was considered as one of the household .
the way in which mr. [male] put the case was this , in marrying [female] i had to care for her well being in case of my death . but well being is not to be secured by ample , independent possession of property . on the contrary , occasions might arise in which such possession might expose her to the more danger . she is ready prey to any man who knows how to play adroitly either on her affectionate ardor or her quixotic enthusiasm .
she was so capable , so cheerful in spite of the fact that she was having a hard time . and then their minds seemed to blend so remarkably , there were no odd corners to be smoothed away . never in his life had he felt so supremely at his ease with one of the opposite sex . he loved claire -- he drove that fact home almost angrily to himself . but he was forced to admit that he had always been aware of something in the nature of a barrier between them .
a dog in the stables began to howl in sympathy . and with the sound came a curious soothing of [male] 's nerves . he might feel broken hearted later , but for the moment , with this double accompaniment . it was impossible for a man with humour in his soul to dwell on the deeper emotions . [male] and his canine duettist had brought him to earth .
the durande started pleasantly , the passengers , as soon as their bags and portmanteaus were installed upon and under the benches . took that customary survey of the vessel which seems indispensable under the circumstances . two of the passengers -- the tourist and the parisian . had never seen a steam vessel before , and from the moment the paddles began to revolve . they stood admiring the foam , then they looked with wonderment at the smoke .
he had last seen her on the lawn behind the small house . just at that time when her passion for crosbie was at the strongest . eames had gone thither impelled by a foolish desire to declare to her his hopeless love . and she had answered him by telling him that she loved mr crosbie better than all the world besides . of course she had done so , at that time .
a love ideal of the cardinal bird and his mate . told with delicacy and humor , may be had wherever books are sold . ask for grosset and [female] 's list . a [location] society girl buys a ranch which becomes the center of frontier warfare . her loyal superintendent rescues her when she is captured by bandits .
there was something in the tone of his son 's conversation which pained the marquis much . but his son was known to be a wise and prudent man . and one who was rising in the political world , the marquis sighed , and shook his head . and murmured something as to the duty which lay upon the great to bear the troubles incident to their greatness . by which he meant that sores and blisters should be kept open .
they sat down , and [location] , turning when she reached the window . saw [male] with his hand raised in gesticulation and his mouth open . as if ready to speak the moment cassandra ceased , [location] 's duty . whether it was to pull a curtain or move a chair . was either forgotten or discharged , but she continued to stand by the window without doing anything .
[male] knew three things about his father . he had had one , he was not square , and he drank himself to death . he could not remember his father , but he knew many men engaged in the occupation of his passing . so he well understood why his mother never expressed any regrets . vivid in his mind was her face .
when [female] and [female] entered the theatre they found that [male] had taken excellent places . and concluded that he had got them for nothing through the influence of the lady of his choice . as a matter of fact he had paid full prices for those two seats . like any other outsider , and even then had a difficulty in getting them . it being a king 's night .
that day was one of gloom in adare house . the baby 's fever grew steadily worse , until in [male] 's eyes [male] read the terrible fear . he remained mostly with adare in the big room . the lamps were lighted , and adare had just risen from his chair . when [male] came through the door , she was swaying .
first she gathered it together , stuck the fork into it . then with a rapid , supple movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it . and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she drew herself up . and arching her full bosom under the white smock , with a smart turn swung the fork in her arms . and flung the bundle of hay high onto the cart , ivan , obviously doing his best to save her every minute of unnecessary labor .
she took my arm and pulled me away toward a boudoir . everybody , men and women . made room for [female] to pass . having reached the further end of the suite of reception rooms . we entered a small semi circular cabinet , my companion threw herself on a divan .
so this is dimchurch , i shake out the chalk dust from the skirts of my dress . i long for the least bit of looking glass to see myself in . here is the population ( to the number of at least five or six ) , gathered together . informed by the scouts -- and it is my woman 's business to produce the best impression of myself that i can . we advance along the little road , i smile upon the population .
from the candles and dumb shadows , and the house where love had died . i stole to the vast moonlight and the whispering life outside , but i found no lips of comfort . no home in the moon 's light ( i , little and lone and frightened in the unfriendly night ) . and no meaning in the voices. , , , far over the lands and through the dark . beyond the ocean , i willed to think of you !
`` this is all a blind , '' she said at the end of an unpardonable sentence . `` he 's pretending , '' i , who had felt his agony all the evening like a wound in my own body . was past speech then , and i did not care what i did to stop her . i gripped her small shoulders with my large hands . and shook her till her jewels rattled and she scratched my fingers and gasped for breath .
i must have been hard to please , indeed , if i had not approved of the room . and of everything about it , the bow window looked out on the same lovely view which i had admired . in the morning , from my bedroom , the furniture was the perfection of luxury and beauty . the table in the centre was bright with gaily bound books . elegant conveniences for writing , and beautiful flowers .
[female] 's face was a picture . surprise , astonishment , and confusion followed each other across his stolid countenance . and with quicker pace than he was ever known to use in his life before . he made his way to his seat . no sooner had the reading began again when once more the door clicked .
he will hear no tone of the maiden he loves so well ! no telephone communicates with his cell , but , , but when is known the secret i have to tell . wide will be thrown the door of his dungeon cell , sir [male] . my pain and my distress again it is not easy to express . my amazement , my surprise , again you may discover from my eyes .
she was stiff as she crawled out of bed . but a rub with cold water left her feeling that she was stronger than she ever had been . that she was a woman , not a dependent girl . already , in the beating prairie sun glare . the wide main street of gopher prairie was drying .
the doctor , without shaking hands with villefort . without adding a word to what he had said , went out , amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household . the same evening all villefort 's servants , who had assembled in the kitchen . and had a long consultation , came to tell madame [male] villefort that they wished to leave . no entreaty , no proposition of increased wages .
you were mistaken , my dear alicia , in supposing me fixed at this place for the rest of the winter . it grieves me to say how greatly you were mistaken . for i have seldom spent three months more agreeably than those which have just flown away . at present , nothing goes smoothly ; the females of the family are united against me . you foretold how it would be when i first came to langford .
yashvin overtook him with his cap . and led him home , and half an hour later vronsky had regained his self possession . but the memory of that race remained for long in his heart . the cruelest and bitterest memory of his life . the external relations of [male] and his wife had remained unchanged .
armitage stood perfectly still , the neighborhood and the house itself were quiet . the two men in the third story room were probably engrossed with the business at which armitage had left them . and his immediate affair was with the servian alone , the fellow continued to mumble his threats . but armitage had resolved to play the part of an englishman who understood no german . and he addressed the man sharply in english several times to signify that he did not understand .
in fact , his disappointment at the nature of those tongues had . after a while , been the means of still further glorifying the erudition of christminster . to acquire languages , departed or living in spite of such obstinacies as he now knew them inherently to possess . was a herculean performance which gradually led him on to a greater interest in it than in the presupposed patent process . the mountain weight of material under which the ideas lay in those dusty volumes called the classics piqued him into a dogged .
kitty saw that varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that she needed an escort . `` no , i always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me , '' she said . taking her hat , and kissing [female] once more , without saying what was important . she stepped out courageously with the music under her arm and vanished into the twilight of the summer night . bearing away with her her secret of what was important and what gave her the calm and dignity so much to be envied .
the first effect of this letter on [female] was half stupefying . the implicit confidence that her destiny must be one of luxurious ease . where any trouble that occurred would be well clad and provided for , had been stronger in her own mind than in her mamma 's . being fed there by her youthful blood and that sense of superior claims which made a large part of her consciousness . it was almost as difficult for her to believe suddenly that her position had become one of poverty and of humiliating dependence .
then [female] took [female] 's arm . little rose let go her hand , and they went into the parlor and were married . when the ceremony was over , [female] kissed [female] . and her father kissed her , and the girls and dorry and [female] . and then , without waiting for any one else , she left her place and went straight to where [female] lay on her sofa .
the discovery was precisely the discovery of swithincleeve . another man had forestalled his fame by a period of about six weeks . then the youth found that the goddess philosophy . to whom he had vowed to dedicate his whole life , would not in return support him through a single hour of despair . in truth , the impishness of circumstance was newer to him than it would have been to a philosopher of threescore and ten .
during the days of radway 's visit . [male] felt an obligation to appear presentable , and every evening . when dinner was over , radway would smoke a cigar in his company . listening to his stories of old galway days and sportsmen long since dead . as [male] 's memory for immediate things had faded he seemed to remember his early days more clearly .
mr. [male] was never aware that his conversation and advances were received coldly . for to shift one 's point of view beyond certain limits is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind . we are none of [male] aware of the impression we produce on brazilian monkeys of feeble understanding . it is possible they see hardly anything in us . moreover , mr. [male] was a man of sober passions .
prince [male] gave him a look . but said nothing and went away , he felt sad and depressed , it was all so strange . so unlike what he had hoped , for a moment he dozed . but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream . his mother and her large white hand , sonya 's thin little shoulders .
till she had made herself [female] of its contents . however , she could have neither repose nor comfort ; and with the sun 's first rays she was determined to peruse it . but many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene , she shuddered , tossed about in her bed . and envied every quiet sleeper , the storm still raged , and various were the noises . more terrific even than the wind , which struck at intervals on her startled ear .
he was there , in the shadowy back pew . with the grill behind it through which once insistent hands had reached to summon him . he was there , with [male] 's prayer book in his hand . and none of the [male] of the day in his heart . he knelt and rose with the others , [male] was beaten .
from east and west and south all trails now led to the post , by the end of the third day after the arrival of the company 's supplies . a babel of fighting , yelling , ceaselessly moving discord had driven forth the [male] and quiet in which cummins wife had died , the fighting and discord were among the dogs . and the yelling was a necessary human accompaniment , half a hundred packs . almost as wild and as savage as the wolves from whom half of them possessed a strong inheritance of blood .
we arranged that all our men should come and fall into order with pike and musket . over against our dung hill , and we settled early in the day . that their wives might come and look at them , for most of these men had good wives . quite different from sweethearts , such as the militia had ; women indeed who could hold to a man . and see to him , and bury him .
amelia , he came to me by your command . to examine my heart respecting count [male] . i told him that i would never marry the count , [male] . he talked of my rank in life . of my aunts and cousins ; of my grandfather , and great-grandfather .
the officer turned fiercely round , and would have come towards [male] . who was so bewildered by the scene that even yet he did not understand who the stranger was . did not perceive for an instant that he saw the realization of his greatest dread . but [female] laid her hand on kinraid 's arm . and assumed to herself the right of speech , [female] did not know her voice .
but the young man would not believe she was serious and had laughed at her fears . they would be back in an hour , he had told her . and so , helpless , she had made the best of it . promising herself a sharp retaliation on her escort when she was safely home again . [female] remembered stopping at a lonely spot where two gate posts stood sentinel by the side of the road .
fortunately the dye washed off easily and [female] , somewhat consoled , betook herself to the east gable while [female] ran home . presently [female] came down again , clothed and in her right mind , the muslin dress she had fondly hoped to wear was bobbing merrily about on the line outside . so she was forced to content herself with her [female] lawn . she had the fire on and the tea steeping when [female] returned . the latter wore her muslin , at least , and carried a covered platter in her hand .
writing now of what his own eyes beheld , lord [male] tells [male] how sir [male] to snatch a weapon from the armoured walls . how [male] barked out a single word in arabic , and how at that word a half dozen of his supple blackamoors sprang upon the knight like greyhounds upon a hare and bore him writhing to the ground , lady [female] . her husband does not appear to have done anything , or else modesty keeps him silent on the score of it . [male] , white to the lips , continued to look on , whilst [male] . overcome , covered his face with his hands in sheer horror .
it may be most worthily seen from precisely the point where our two friends were now standing . at any nearer view the grandeur ofpeter 's hides itself behind the immensity of its separate parts . so that we see only the front , only the sides . only the pillared length and loftiness of the portico . and not the mighty whole , but at this distance the entire outline of the world 's cathedral .
the shutters were closed , and one on entering could distinguish nothing but that long [male] shadow in the middle of the room . young [male] opened a shutter a little way . and a slanting shaft of spring sunlight came in and shot athwart the coffin . the old man tiptoed up and leaned over and looked at the dead woman , [female] adams had left further instructions about her funeral . which no one understood , but which were faithfully carried out , she wished .
and then arose a difficult question -- who was to take the risk of making overtures so unpleasant ? i waited for the rest to offer ; and as none was ready . the burden fell on me , and seemed to be of my own inviting . hence i undertook the task . sooner than reason about it ; for to give the cause of everything is worse than to go through with it .
it is scarcely necessary to state that [male] could not avoid noting the farmer 's bearing to night towards their entertainer . yet there was nothing exceptional in his actions beyond what appertained to his time of performing them . it was when the rest were all looking away that boldwood observed her . when they regarded her he turned aside . when they thanked or praised he was silent ; when they were inattentive he murmured his thanks .
in a given time , with the aid of progress . mechanisms become perfected , and as light increases , the sheet of water will be employed to purify the sheet of air . that is to say , to wash the sewer , the reader knows , that by `` washing the sewer '' we mean : the restitution of the filth to the earth . the return to the soil of dung and of manure to the fields .
maud had finished her task and come aft . where she stood beside me , a small cap perched on her wind-blown hair . her cheeks flushed from exertion , her eyes wide and bright with the excitement . her nostrils quivering to the rush and bite of the fresh salt air . her brown eyes were like a startled deer 's , there was a wild , keen look in them i had never seen before .
do not name it , sir , returned [male] , it will be ekally a pleasure an a . it ' l be ekally a pleasure and a -- finding himself unable to balance his sentence after two efforts . mr [male] wisely dropped it , he took [male] 's card and appropriate pecuniary compliment . he was earnest to finish his commission at once , and his principal was in the same mind . so his principal offered to set him down at the marshalsea gate .
alas , he had been left the sole spectator of his piece . it was far worse than it had been a little while before . he no longer beheld anything but backs . i am [male] , the big , patient man . whom he had already consulted in a critical moment , had remained with his face turned towards the stage .
that was the easy answer i returned to the question i had asked myself . but i knew that there was another answer -- a reason more powerful than the first . and i could no longer thrust it back , or hide its shining face with the dull . leaden mask of mere intellectual curiosity , because i loved her . loved her as i had never loved before , never could love any other being .
she was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness . among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past . which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it , she could do justice to the superiority of lady [female] 's motives in this . over those of her father and [female] ; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness . but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung .
in the network of streams draining the eastern portion of [location] and known as the saginaw waters . the great firm of morrison and [female] had for many years carried on extensive logging operations in the wilderness . the number of their camps was legion . of their employees a multitude , each spring they had gathered in their capacious booms from thirty to fifty million feet of pine logs . now at last , in the early eighties , they reached the end of their holdings .
this same thing was repeated once more ; and it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that sir [male] lost his temper . and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task of chasing me down . why , he had not any show in the world at that . it was a game of tag . with all the advantage on my side ; i whirled out of his path with ease whenever i chose .
he would do so , that is , if he could induce carry to accompany him . in the meantime , there was nothing left to him but to leave her with mrs. [female] . and to pay ten shillings a week for her board and lodging . there was one point on which he could not quite make up his mind . whether he would or would not first acquaint old mrs. [male] with his intention .
on the following morning the party was of course discussed in the [female] family under various circumstances . at the breakfast table mrs. [female] , with her son and daughter , were present . and then a song of triumph was sung , everything had gone off with honour and glory . and the brewery had been immortalized for years to come , mrs. [female] 's praises were spoken . with some little drawback of a sneer on them .
[female] was the duke 's first [female] . and it was intolerable that the duke 's first [female] should be unable to marry because she would have nothing to live upon . it became , at least , intolerable as soon as the duchess had taken it into her head to like the first [female] . no doubt there were other first cousins as badly off , or perhaps worse , as to whom the duchess would care nothing whether they were rich or poor . married or single ; but then they were first cousins who had not had the advantage of interesting the duchess .
the change of affairs had also wrought a change in [female] . who seemed and really was better than she had been for many days , gladly would she have stayed with [female] . but she felt that duty called her to [female] 's bedside . with unwearying devotion she hung over the pillow of her sister . who seemed more quiet when she knew [female] was near , once she looked wistfully in her face .
but suppose [male] insisted on clearing everything up before he married ? for to [male] it was unthinkable that any girl in her senses would refuse him . suppose he went back to norada ? he had not changed greatly in ten years . he had been well known there , a conspicuous figure , her mind began to turn on the possibility of keeping him away from norada . some time later she heard the office door open and then close with [male] 's characteristic slam .
adam was still motionless , looking at him as he came up . he understood it all now -- the locket and everything else that had been doubtful to him . a terrible scorching light showed him the hidden letters that changed the meaning of the past . if he had moved a muscle , he must inevitably have sprung upon [male] like a tiger . and in the conflicting emotions that filled those long moments .
her aunt bertram had recollected her on this occasion with an unusual degree of wakefulness . it had really occurred to her , unprompted , that [female] , preparing for a ball . might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid 's , and when dressed herself . she actually sent her own maid to assist her . too late , of course , to be of any use , mrs. [female] had just reached the attic floor .
give my love to aunt rose and [female] -- is she quite my sister by this time ? like a girl he touched the letter to his lips before putting it in the envelop . [male] would watch the eastern newspapers , he knew . and couple the two stories together , the lower [male] was swept by a strong salt wind when allard reached the deck . green and white waves running under the bright [male] and lashed to swirling froth by the innumerable boats plowing back and forth .
`` as if i had not something better to do , '' rejoined he . but i saw him give her a piece of gold . which she took unscrupulously , and then danced off to answer the door bell , ringing just now every five minutes . as the various servants came to [female] the half boarders . the reader must not think too hardly of [female] ; on the whole .
but where was he to go ? to whom was he to turn himself ? he went to a high desk which stood in one corner of the room . and unlocking it , took out a revolving pistol , and for a while carried it about with him in his hand . he turned it up , and looked at it . and tried the lock , and snapped it without caps .
poulter 's alley is a narrow dark passage somewhere behind the mansion house . and the bremen coffee house . why so called no one can now tell , -- is one of those strange houses of public resort in the city at which the guests seem never to eat . never to drink , never to sleep , but to come in and out after a mysterious and almost ghostly fashion . seeing their friends , -- or perhaps their enemies , in nooks and corners .
the mouth opened mechanically to receive more , and gradually she revived , she sat up and looked round . and recollecting all , fell down again in weak and passive despair , her little child crawled to her . and wiped with its fingers the thick coming tears which she now had strength to weep . it was now high time to attend to the man . he lay on straw , so damp and mouldy .
she did her best to speak enthusiastically , and succeeded , no one save knight and constance guessed it was an effort . knight saw , and was grateful , constance saw also . and smiled to herself at what she fancied was the girl 's jealousy of an old friend of the new husband . an old friend who was `` one of the most beautiful women '' the girl had seen . [female] 's hesitation inclined constance to be more interested than ever in the countess [female] santiago .
on the next morning [male] came to the vicarage . it had been arranged that he would drive [male] over to heytesbury . and that he would call for him after breakfast . a somewhat late hour , -- two in the afternoon , -- had been fixed for going on with the murder case . as it was necessary that a certain constable should come down from [location] on that morning .
sergey ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for writing a review . but a month passed , and a second , and still there was silence , only in the northern beetle . in a comic article on the singer drabanti . who had lost his voice , there was a contemptuous allusion to koznishev 's book . suggesting that the book had been long ago seen through by everyone , and was a subject of general ridicule .
husband and wife were animated by emotions deeper seated and more instinctive than had ever before confronted them . yet while amherst 's resistance was gathering strength from the conflict . [female] unexpectedly collapsed in tears and submission . she would do as he wished , of course . give up seeing [female] , dismiss bowfort , wash her hands .
what had become of that man , that mysterious man , whom the coachman had seen emerge from the grating of the grand sewer bearing upon his back the unconscious marius . and whom the police agent on the watch had arrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent ? what had become of the agent himself ? why had this agent preserved silence ? had the man succeeded in making his escape ? had he bribed the agent ? why did this man give no sign of life to marius .
it was natural that it should be so , and was she . [female] , the girl to stand in his way and to force herself upon him . if he loved another ? certainly not , -- though there might be a triple ducal coronet to be had . but were there not other considerations ? could it be well that the heir of the house of omnium should marry an [female] girl . as to whose humble birth whispers were already afloat ? as his friend .
the [female] house stood on the hill behind the town . a long , rather low white house on italian lines , in summer . until the family exodus to the maine coast . the brilliant canopy which extended out over the terrace indicated . as [female] put it , that the family was `` in residence . ''
details of incidents mortifying to his pride . and derogatory from his authority , were intermingled with the earnest advice of his wisest and most attached counsellors that he should presently return to england . as his presence offered the only hope of saving the kingdom from all the horrors of civil discord . of which [location] and [location] were likely to avail themselves . filled with the most painful anxiety , [male] read .
but he had a strong sense of fellowship with them . when he advanced towards the laborers they had not gone to work again . but were standing in that form of rural grouping which consists in each turning a shoulder towards the other . at a distance of two or three yards , they looked rather sulkily at [male] . who walked quickly with one hand in his pocket and the other thrust between the buttons of his waistcoat .
he ran on , his knees felt weak , he shouted the name again . and the other voice was silent , things loomed up out of the mist ahead of him . between him and the glowing windows . some one -- two people -- were advancing to meet him , doubtfully , wonderingly . kent was staggering . but he cried the name again , and this time it was a woman 's cry that answered .
at this , [female] again intervened , she implored me prettily not to deny her this little kindness . [female] had only consented to be converted because they have crosses in the lutheran churches and believe in the sacraments . so that by joining them a man does not risk losing his heavenly hopes so much . and the commander in chief would not be down upon him so fiercely as if he were to go over to the calvinist kuruczes . the end of it all was that i .
the `` little monster '' we should find it difficult ourselves to describe him otherwise . was , in fact , not a new born child , it was a very angular and very lively little mass . imprisoned in its linen sack , stamped with the cipher of messire [male] chartier . then bishop of [location] , with a head projecting . that head was deformed enough ; one beheld only a forest of red hair .
all [male] -- one great cloud , drawn from east to west . conceals the heavens , but there are lights below . torches burn in jerusalem , and cast on yonder stony mount a lurid glow . i see men station would there , and gleaming spears . a sound , too , from afar , invades my ears .
`` a life of your own '' -- that was what even [female] , in her obscure way . felt to be best worth suffering for , and how was a spirit like [female] 's . thrilling with youth and sympathy , to conceive of an isolated existence as the final answer to that craving ? a life circumscribed by one 's own poor personal consciousness would not be life at all . far better the `` adventure of the diver '' than the shivering alone on the bank !
i found that her judgment as to values and fabrics was unerring . but her taste as to colors and designs frequently clashed with mine . save for the fact that she became fatigued before we had finished our shopping . there would have been no individual touch of mine in our home . as it was , i was not sorry that she found herself too indisposed to go with me the second day .
neither could ever again forget the noisy rush of the stream , the glad singing of birds in a thicket overhanging the bank . the tinkle of the cow bells as the cattle began to climb to the pastures for a luxurious hour ere sundown . it was typical of their lives that they should be divided by the infant inn . almost at its source , and that thenceforth the barrier should become ever wider and deeper till it reached the infinite sea . he seemed to take his defeat well , he was pale .
`` must decide , and i have decided , '' she said , and she would have gone away . but at that moment yashvin walked into the room . [male] greeted him and remained , why , when there was a [female] in her soul . and she felt she was standing at a turning point in her life . which might have fearful consequences -- why , at that minute , she had to keep up appearances before an outsider .
after very anxious scrutiny , he came out of his retreat . and went briskly down the street as if he were going away altogether ; then , suddenly turned about . and went , at the same pace , and with the same feint , up the street . he had gone no further up the street than he had gone down . when he crossed the road and disappeared , the object of this last manoeuvre was only apparent .
d'artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details . how , not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty . he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience . how they had gone together to the tennis court . and how , upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face .
by this time the woman had fought her way through the press . bursting the remaining buttons off her ulster in so doing , and reached the bar which separated spectators from the space reserved for the officials . on the further side of the bar was a gangway . and beyond it a table at which mr. [male] sat . he had been busy writing something all this time .
he loosed his son 's hand and stepped back . they bowed formally to each other , and then [male] tour d'azyr bowed to mlle . [male] kercadiou in utter silence . a bow that contained something of utter renunciation , of finality . that done he turned and walked stiffly out of the room .
a bad hunter i proved after larger game . bird and beast despised my snares . which took me so many waking hours at night to invent . so many daylight hours to make , once , seeing a troop of monkeys high up in the tall trees . i followed and watched them for a long time .
the question had come before her for decision so suddenly , that she had not . in fact , had time to think of this as she was making her answer . all she had done was to feel that she could not be to him what he wished her to be . and even as yet she had hardly asked herself why she must be so steadfast in her refusal . but she had refused him steadfastly , and she did not for a moment think of reducing the earnestness of her resolution .
he let himself into the house with his latch key . and banged the door behind his back , but no sooner had he breathed the soft . woolly , stagnant air within than a change came over him . his ferocious strength ebbed away , and he began to tremble , the hall passage and staircase were in darkness . this was by his orders -- coming in late , he always forgot to put out the gas .
she did not reply -- she kept her attention riveted on the music . music which she knew by memory . which she had played over and over again , in former times , without the book . i only knew that she had heard me . i only knew that she was aware of my being close to her , by seeing the red spot on the cheek that was nearest to me fade out .
nearly at the moment when the tide ceased to raise it . the cable ceased to slide , suddenly , but without commotion , the pulleys stopped . the vast machine had taken its place in the bark . as if placed there by a powerful hand , it stood straight , upright , motionless , firm . the iron floor of the engine room rested with its four corners evenly upon the hold .
i did not answer , while i was speaking , my eyes rested on the last sentence of the letter . your mother 's daughter has a tender place in my heart . for your mother was my first , my best , my only friend , those words and the doubt which had just escaped me as to the sanity of the writer of the letter . acting together on my mind , suggested an idea , which i was literally afraid to express openly . or even to encourage secretly , i began to doubt whether my own faculties were not in danger of losing their balance .
this plunged me again , for when i considered the thing calmly . and took my husband as he really was , a diligent . careful man in the main work of laying up an estate for his children . and that he knew nothing of the dreadful circumstances that he was in . i could not but confess to myself that my proposal was very unreasonable , and what no wife that had the good of her family at heart would have desired .
[female] heard the sound as if his own spirit stood behind him . outside him , and listened to it , his body was in a trance of exhaustion . his spirit heard thinly , his body could not answer . only he knew his heart was getting quieter , he was divided entirely between his spirit . which stood outside , and knew , and his body , that was a plunging .
she began to tremble and to laugh in a whisper , her eyes danced in the red glow of the dying turf . she slipped off her shoes and went to a closet in the wall . there she picked an apple out of a barrel . and brought it to the fire and roasted it . then , down on her knees before the hearth , she took took two pinches of the apple and swallowed them .
suddenly it loosened from the rock its sixth antenna . and darting it at him , seized him by the left arm . at the same moment it advanced its head with a violent movement . in one second more its mouth would have fastened on his breast . bleeding in the sides , and with his two arms entangled .
[female] took her pointer from her desk . it was a long , heavy hardwood pointer . it was far from being the most severe punishment [female] had ever undergone . [female] , even the stormy souled [female] she was at that moment . could not have punished any child cruelly , but the pointer nipped keenly and finally [male] 's bravado failed him .
but neither of them now added another word , [female] stood sullenly alone . leaning against the chimney piece , with her eyes fastened upon the door . as if watching for its opening : but not all the previous resolution of [female] . could inspire courage sufficient to address her , after viewing the increased sternness of her countenance . [female] was prattling busily to lady [female] ; and lady [female] .
this silence was seasoned with the lives of the saints . read aloud from a little pulpit with a desk . which was situated at the foot of the crucifix , the reader was one of the big girls . in weekly turn , at regular distances , on the bare tables . there were large , varnished bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks .
[male] interest in this work increased as he proceeded . and he bustled round and round the kitchen as lightly as a girl . [female] , the indoor factotum . having lost himself among the quart pots of budmouth . there had been nobody left here to prepare supper , and [male] had it all to himself .
only twice more did the housekeeper reappear , and then her stay in the room was very short . and mr. [male] was sharp with her , but her hands were estella 's hands . and her eyes were estella 's eyes . and if she had reappeared a hundred times i could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth . it was a dull evening , for wemmick drew his wine .
fortunately a blacksmith 's son who also followed the hounds under disadvantages . namely , on foot ( a loose way of hunting which had struck some even frivolous minds as immoral ) . was naturally also in the rear , and happened to be within sight of [male] 's misfortune . he ran to give help which was greatly needed , for [male] was a great deal stunned . and the complete recovery of sensation came in the form of pain .
and whether it was by the gray suit , or the mustache . or the knowing how to ride that her congratulations were so emphatically secured , i know not ! others are yet more quaint , and more to my liking . nan nan is nan nan : i can not let you off what she said ! no tears or sentiment came from her to prevent me laughing .
the maiden 's mouth is cold , , , fold over simple fold binding her head . inside this exterior , over which the eye might have roved as over a thing scarcely percipient . almost inorganic , there was the record of a pulsing life which had learnt too well . for its years , of the dust and ashes of things . of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of love .
the amusingly varied crests of these beautiful edifices were the product of the same art as the simple roofs which they overshot . and were , actually , only a multiplication of the square or the cube of the same geometrical figure . hence they complicated the whole effect . without disturbing it ; completed , without overloading it , geometry is harmony . some fine mansions here and there made magnificent outlines against the picturesque attics of the left bank .
the shutting of the door stopped [male] from replying . they glided into the places where [male] had left them . and [male] , stepping forward as that old gentleman returned , informed him that he had accidentally extinguished the candle . mr [male] looked on as he re lighted it at the lamp in the hall . and preserved a profound taciturnity respecting the person who had been holding him in conversation .
he might have softened his father ; but all , perhaps all , would think her selfish and ungrateful . she might have to endure the reproach again and again ; she might hear it . or see it , or know it to exist for ever in every connexion about her . she could not but feel some resentment against mr. [male] . yet , if he really loved her , and were unhappy too , it was all wretchedness together .
however , my stature and holly club kept these fellows from doing more than casting sheep 's eyes at me . for it was still broad daylight , and the view of the distant villages . chelsea , battersea , tyburn , and others . as well as a few large houses , among the hams and towards the river . made it seem less lonely , therefore i sang a song in the broadest exmoor dialect .
thus , the story here presented will be told by more than one pen , as the story of an offence against the laws is told in court by more than one witness . with the same object , in both cases , to present the truth always in its most direct and most intelligible aspect . and to trace the course of one complete series of events . by making the persons who have been most closely connected with them , at each successive stage . relate their own experience , word for word .
ponine and zelma were playing with the cat . the travellers were eating or drinking or singing . not a glance was fixed on her , she had not a moment to lose . she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees . made sure once more that no one was watching her ; then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it .
sections were assigned to everybody , -- clover 's opposite [female] 's so that she might hear him if he needed anything in the night . and mr. [male] called for all the bonnets and hats . and amid much laughter proceeded to pin up each in thick folds of newspaper . and fasten it on a hook not to be taken down till the end of the journey . [male] 's feathered turban took its turn with the rest .
the walk to the beach was no inconsiderable one , consisting as it did of a long . sandy path , upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that bordered it on either side made frequent and unexpected inroads . there were acres of yellow camomile reaching out on either hand . further away still , vegetable gardens abounded , with frequent small plantations of orange or lemon trees intervening . the dark green clusters glistened from afar in the sun .
it is in this manner that , in the blindness of a poor political economy . we drown and allow to float down stream and to be lost in the gulfs the well being of all . there should be nets at saint cloud for the public fortune . economically considered , the matter can be summed up thus : [location] is a spendthrift . [location] , that model city .
considine also tried to interest her in new things and to distract her mind . his methods were tactful , he knew perfectly well that the official manner of condolence that had gone down so well with the radways would not do for her . he just treated her as the child that he knew her to be . trying to induce her to join in a game of pretending that nothing had happened . gabrielle realised his humane attempt from the first and even .
mr dolls now struck out the highly unexpected discovery that he had been insulted by lightwood . and stated his desire to `` have it out with him '' on the spot , and defied him to come on , upon the liberal terms of a sovereign to a halfpenny . mr dolls then fell a crying . and then exhibited a tendency to fall asleep , this last manifestation as by far the most alarming .
price : one tooth , one franc , fifty centimes . two teeth , two francs ; three teeth . two francs , fifty , take advantage of this opportunity . this take advantage of this opportunity meant . have as many teeth extracted as possible , he had been married and had had children .
not far from mdlle , koslow sits another young lady by name adele dronsart . this is a belgian , rather low of stature , in form heavy . with broad waist , short neck and limbs . good red and white complexion , features well chiselled and regular , well cut eyes of a clear brown colour . light brown hair , good teeth , age not much above fifteen .
had such been the case he would have gone away , and left his message untold . as he entered the room his mind was naturally full of the tidings from clavering . count pateroff and his message had lost some of their importance through this other event . and the emptiness of the childless house was the first subject of conversation between him and lady ongar . `` i pity my sister greatly , '' said she .
felipe did not answer , a better thrust was never seen on any field than the [female] 's question . she repeated it , still more deliberately , in her wonted gentle voice . the [female] was herself again , as she had not been for a moment since she came upon alessandro and ramona at the brook . how just and reasonable the question sounded , as she repeated it slowly . with an expression in her eyes , of poising and weighing matters .
edmund , [male] , and [male] did . in their different ways , look and speak as much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as sir [male] could desire . [male] 's feelings were for the other two , his father had never conferred a favour or shewn a kindness more to his satisfaction . lady bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented , and had no objections to make , sir [female] engaged for its giving her very little trouble . and she assured him that she was not at all afraid of the trouble .
but she believed he had already returned home . which i was very far from crediting , your kind invitation is accepted by [male] with pleasure . and on thursday next we and our little ones will be with you . pray heaven , [female] may not be in town again by that time ! i wish we could bring dear frederica too , but i am sorry to say that her mother 's errand hither was to [female] her away .
there was no need on the part of the authorities to set in motion an army corps against this new confederacy . the peasantry did the work for them instead . the galician peasants crushed the polish gentry , the censorship had prevented the hungarian newspapers from making known the details of this rebellion . but when the diet met , it was impossible to prevent the fiery deputy for comorn . the youthful [male] pazmandy , from raising his mighty voice on behalf of the poles .
in fact , at the moment when [male] accosted him . old fauchelevent held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed . during the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them . it was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by [male] . i said to myself , the moon is bright : it is going to freeze .
all day she pored over the words in an agony of longing . trying to read into them regret , emotion , memories , some echo of the tumult in her own bosom . but she had signed `` susy , '' and he signed `` n.l . '' that seemed to put an abyss between them , after all , she was free and he was not . perhaps , in view of his situation , she had only increased the distance between them by her unconventional request for a meeting .
[female] made as if she did not hear , and she was spared more by the coming of some of her guests . the card tables filled , there was no more danger of being private with mrs. [female] boyce . indeed , the lady , as if she had done all she wanted . took her leave early , she was affectionate about it , for which [female] liked her none the better . through most of that evening , amid the flutter of cards and the clatter --
fanny thanked him again , but was affected and distressed to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much . or even to be certain of what she ought to say , this was towards the close of their walk . he attended them to the last , and left them only at the door of their own house . when he knew them to be going to dinner , and therefore pretended to be waited for elsewhere . i wish you were not so tired , said he , still detaining [male] after all the others were in the house --
it all came out -- the loan to carpenter , with a hint at the motive . the machinations of the rival firm on [organization] . the notes , the mortgages , the necessity of a big season 's cut . the reasons the rival firm had for wishing to prevent that cut from arriving at the market . the desperate and varied means they had employed .
everybody seemed pleased and interested , everybody , that is to say , except lady caroline and lord belpher . [male] was feeling that he had been tricked , he cursed the imbecility of keggs in suggesting that this man should be invited to dinner . everything had gone wrong , [male] was an undoubted success . the majority of the company were solid for him . as far as exposing his unworthiness in the eyes of maud was concerned .
my skill , greater in this one point than theirs . surprised and charmed them , [female] would sit and watch me by the hour together . then she would take lessons ; and a docile . intelligent , assiduous pupil she made . thus occupied , and mutually entertained , days passed like hours , and weeks like days .
monny had not been mistaken , it was [female] bey . leaning comfortably back in an old-fashioned but not badly appointed open carriage , drawn by two very decent horses . and driven by a smart , red sashed , white robed negro , we saw him in profile as he passed along the road at some distance . but he was reading a paper with an expression so placid that i felt sure he had not seen us . on the seat beside him was a suitcase with the air of having been made in [location] .
he wondered how long miss [female] was going to stay in hintock . the season was unpropitious for accidental encounters with her out of doors . and except by accident he saw not how they were to become acquainted . one thing was clear -- any acquaintance with her could only , with a due regard to his future . be casual , at most of the nature of a flirtation ; for he had high aims .
nevertheless , there are today in the artistic youth so much life . power , and , so to speak , predestination , that in our schools of architecture in particular . at the present time , the professors , who are detestable , produce , not only unconsciously but even in spite of themselves , excellent pupils . quite the reverse of that potter mentioned by [male] . who dreamed amphorae and produced pots , currit rota , urcens exit .
some provision was being made for himself in the will , and he had no reason to be in a bad humor . even if a bad humor had been common with him , he was perfectly convinced that he had penetrated all the secrets of the situation . but he had no diabolical delight in it . he had only the small movements of gratified self loving resentment in discerning that this marriage had fulfilled his own foresight in not being as satisfactory as the supercilious young lady had expected it to be . and as [male] wished to feign that it was , he had no persistent spite much stronger than what gives the seasoning of ordinary scandal to those who repeat it and exaggerate it by their conjectures .
for some time there was no answer , but at last one of the men . a fine , broad chested fellow , well on in middle-life , with deep graven features and an eye like a hawk 's . spoke , and said that the orders that they had received were not to harm the white men . nothing was said of their [female] servant . so , egged on thereto by a woman who was now dead , they proceeded to try to hot pot him after the ancient and honourable custom of their country .
three minutes were enough for the packing of the bag . then , luggage in hand , she turned at the door for a last look . such as a released convict might give to his cell , that must mean that the dragon had retreated from the combat and retired to her lair ! not to be chased from the house by the sharp arrows of insult seemed almost too good to be true . but when [female] arrived , bag in hand .
as there was nothing which better recommended itself this course was decided on . and after taking from her trunk the articles that might be required for an incarceration of two or three days they left the said trunk at the cloak room . and went on by the last train , which reached warborne about ten o'clock . it was only necessary for lady constantine to cover her face with the thick veil that she had provided for this escapade . to walk out of the station without fear of recognition .cleeve came forth from another compartment .
disappointed he was ; and bitterly , too , it came like a thunder clap on [male] all . that the vessel which contained our fortune had been wrecked , and gone to the bottom with all its stores . together with several of the crew , and the unfortunate merchant himself . i was grieved for him ; i was grieved for the overthrow of all our air built castles . but , with the elasticity of youth , i soon recovered the shook .
so , in the bright summer morning , [male] saw the last of the old house which for nearly seven years had sheltered mr. [male] and his wife and children . the weedy garden in which [female] had idled away so many hours of her early girlhood . the straggling vines under which she had dreamed bright sentimental dreams over the open leaves of her novels . the young men hired a cab at the nearest cab stand . and drove to the establishment of the friendly greengrocer who had given shelter to their goods .
at half past eight in the evening he supped with his sister . madame magloire standing behind them and serving them at table . nothing could be more frugal than this repast , if , however , the bishop had one of his cures to supper . madame magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake . or with some fine game from the mountains , every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal .
`` dazed , '' they told themselves , the poor man could not give a wise like answer . he had had a shock , and there was worse before him . they talked in low voices of [male] and of ross [male] . they were sorry for pete . they were still more sorry for the deemster , the deemster 's wig had been taken off and tossed on to the dressing table .
the floor was encumbered , not only with rugs , but with heaps of priceless tiles . persian and moorish , of the best periods and patterns , taken from the walls of arab palaces now destroyed . huge brass salvers ; silver anklets . and chain armour , sabres captured from crusaders . and old illuminated korans , it was difficult to move without knocking something down .
impossible to say , the obscurity was more dense there than elsewhere , it was a pit of mire in a cavern of night . [male] felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet . he entered this slime , there was water on the surface . slime at the bottom , he must pass it . to retrace his steps was impossible , marius was dying , and [male] exhausted .
the trumpets sounded as he spoke -- the spears of the champions were at once lowered and placed in the rests . the spurs were dashed into the flanks of the horses . and the two foremost ranks of either party rushed upon each other in full gallop . and met in the middle of the lists with a shock . the sound of which was heard at a mile 's distance .
from such a home and such surroundings it would not have been strange if he had grown weary of the rough life out west . and deserted his wife , who was beneath him in station . but he had not , he had stayed by her all the years . true , he had not been of much use to her , and much of the time had been but a burden and anxiety . but he had stayed and loved her -- when he was sober .
thinking of the circumstances ten minutes later it seemed to her that she had intended to answer him . but she was now at charing cross , there was a lightness . an emptiness in her head which she could not overcome . and the crowd appeared to her like a blurred , noisy dream , and then the dizziness left her . and she realised the temptation she had escaped .
he looked completely astonished , but not more astonished than pleased ; his eyes brightened ! and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship . alluded to the past , and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already , he was quite as good-looking as he had appeared at lyme . his countenance improved by speaking , and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be . so polished , so easy , so particularly agreeable , that she could compare them in excellence to only one person 's manners .
after clasping both her hands upon his arm , and looking confidentially up into his face . with some hurried words to the effect that she thanked him from her heart ( as she did . if it be the source of earnestness ) . she gradually composed herself , with now and then a word of encouragement from him . as they walked on slowly and almost silently under the darkening trees .
over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses . after the style and manner of [male] . and at each side pretty medallions in crayons . harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment , the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed . the truth was , it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by [male] danglars and his architect .
tollman nodded understandingly , a short while before he had been reading his providence newspaper and a brief paragraph . which would otherwise have escaped his eye , had caught his attention like the red lantern at a railroad crossing . because it contained the name of [male] . the lines were these : `` 'the longest way round , '' a comedy in three acts , by [male] .
raoul , therefore , had , in compliance with the wish of his father . served obstinately and passively the fortunes of [male] , in spite of the tergiversations which were endemic . and , it might be said , inevitable , at that period , [male] ; on being restored to favor . had at once availed himself of all the privileges of the amnesty to ask for many things back again which had been granted to him before . and among others , [male] , [male] fere .
but something in the lines of the mouth betrayed strength . and the clear , low voice had a curious mixture of command and entreaty in its varying tones . not an attractive woman , yet not an ordinary one ; and , as she sat there with her delicate hands lying in her lap . her head bent , and a bitter look on her thin face . she was more interesting than many a blithe and blooming girl .
and so his brother brought him home . shaken in spirit and exhausted in body with his long fast and his overpowering emotion . all night through his brother watched with him alone . for macdonald dubh would have no one else to see him . till , from utter exhaustion , toward the dawning of the day .
[female] 's absence left a sad blank in the household . every one missed her , but nobody so much as clover . who all her life long had been her room mate , confidante , and intimate friend . it was a great help that rose was there for the first three lonely days . dulness and sadness were impossible with that vivacious little person at hand .
they took some while to consume , but she waited . sitting upright in her arm chair while the flame crept from sheet to sheet . discolouring the paper , blackening the writing like a stream of ink . and leaving in the end only flakes of ashes like feathers . and white flakes like white feathers , the last sparks were barely extinguished when she heard a cautious step on the gravel beneath her window .
on the thirteenth of july the pavlograds took part in a serious action for the first time . on the twelfth of july , on the eve of that action . there was a heavy storm of rain and hail . in general , the summer of 1812 was remarkable for its storms , the two pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye . which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and horses .
he then assisted her first into the carriage . undine followed her ; and he mounted his horse and trotted merrily by the side of them . urging the driver at the same time to hasten his speed . so that very soon they were beyond the confines of the imperial city and all its sad remembrances . and now the ladies began to enjoy the beautiful country through which their road lay .
the upshot of the petition was waited for in weatherbury with solicitous interest . the execution had been fixed for eight o'clock on a saturday morning about a fortnight after the sentence was passed . and up to friday afternoon no answer had been received , at that time [male] came from casterbridge gaol . whither he had been to wish boldwood good-bye . and turned down a by street to avoid the town , when past the last house he heard a hammering .
turning graciously to the attendants , miss [female] inquired whether her papa or brother was within ? the reply being that they were both within , mr [male] humbly offered his arm . miss [male] accepting it , was squired up the great staircase by mr [male] . who , if he still believed ( which there is not any reason to doubt ) . that she had no nonsense about her .
annesley kept to her own quarters as constantly as her jangled nerves would allow . but the sea was provokingly smooth , and she proved to be a good sailor . she felt as if she might become hysterical , and perhaps do something foolish . if she tried the experiment of shutting herself up from morning to night . she paced the deck , therefore , and was dimly grateful to knight because he seemed always to be in the smoking room when she took her walks .
his wife held his stick , smiling , bartley smiled too . and his eyes cleared , i will work like the devil . [male] , and be home again before you realize i have gone . he kissed her quickly several times . hurried out of the front door into the rain , and waved to her from the carriage window as the driver was starting his melancholy .
for a little while [female] stood at gaze . speechless in his incredulity , then to revive the anger that for a moment had been whelmed in astonishment came the reflection that he had been duped by [male] . duped by the man he trusted most , he had snarled at [male] and scorned [male] when they had jointly warned him against his lieutenant . if at times he had been in danger of heeding them . yet sooner or later he had concluded that they but spoke to vent their malice .
stark laid the lens against his brow . and bound it on , he opened his own mind wide to receive those memories . before he had fought against them , now he knew that they were his one small chance in this swift gamble with death . two things only of his own he kept firm in that staggering tide of another man 's memories . two names -- ciara and balin .
`` little countess , '' the count 's voice called from behind the door . `` you are not asleep ? '' [female] jumped up , snatched up her slippers . and ran barefoot to her own room , it was a long time before she could sleep . she kept thinking that no one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her . next day the countess called boris aside and had a talk with him .
it was a cheerful company of conspirators that now gathered around the big hearth . [female] , always restless , preferred to stand at one side . an elbow on the mantel shelf , pipe in mouth . and stoddard sought the biggest chair , —and filled it . he and [male] understood each other at once , and [male] 's stories .
the young dog , [male] 's son . might possibly have been the image of his mother , for there was not much resemblance between him and [male] . he was learning the sheep keeping business , so as to follow on at the flock when the other should die . but had got no further than the rudiments as yet -- still finding an insuperable difficulty in distinguishing between doing a thing well enough and doing it too well . so earnest and yet so wrong headed was this young dog ( he had no name in particular .
he had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries of other arrondissements . it was thus that he had , when occasion offered . supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at boulogne . the flax spinning industry at frevent , and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at boubers sur canche . everywhere the name of [male] madeleine was pronounced with veneration .
if eileen was not on the ship her absence would be sufficient proof to him that she was in or near churchill . and in this event he knew that it would be impossible for him to keep from associating with her movements not only those of lord fitzhugh . but also those of jeanne and [male] and of brokaw himself . he could see but two things to do at present . wait and watch , if miss brokaw was not with her father .
thus encouraged she put her toes in the water . gripping mickey and waiting breathlessly to see what happened , nothing happened , while the warm . running water felt [female] , so she dipped lower . and then did her best to make it splash . it was not much of a splash , but it was a satisfying performance to the parties most interested .
she was [male] by his threat to reprimand baldos . for some time her mind had been struggling with what the count had said about `` the lesson . '' it grew upon her that her friend had been bullied and humiliated , perhaps in the presence of spectators . resentment fired her curiosity into action . while the general was explaining one of the new gun carriages to the countess .
she was not to see [male] churchill this morning . he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield . as he was to be at home by the middle of the day . she did not regret it , having arranged all these matters . looked them through , and put them all to rights .
enter an officer , and three or four citizens with clubs or partisans , officer . clubs , bills , and partisans , strike ! beat them down , citizens , down with the capulets ! down with the montagues , chor , now old desire doth in his deathbed lie . and young affection gapes to be his heir .
nasty , tough sort of chap wally mason had been as a boy . and here he was , apparently , not altered a bit , at least the only improvement he could detect was that . whereas in the old days wally , when in an ugly mood like this . would undoubtedly have kicked him , he now seemed content with mere words . all the same , he was being dashed unpleasant , and he was all wrong about poor derek .
i would not even have run the risk of a doubtful contest . but i came forward at the suggestion of the duchess , backed by her personal assurance that the seat was certain as being in your [female] 's hands . it was no doubt understood that your [female] would not yourself interfere . but it was equally well understood that your [female] 's influence was for the time deputed to the duchess . the duchess herself will , i am sure , confirm my statement that i had her direct authority for regarding myself as your [female] 's candidate .
miss [male] 's voice came again to [female] . when she told her story . with no hint of her lover 's name . he went away , and soon afterward , married [male] , but why ? was it love at first sight . or did he believe that his sweetheart was dead ? then [male] was born and the mother died .
it was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for . but he took up a knife , gave it a flourish . and with the words , `` and what i done is worked out and paid for ! '' fell to at his breakfast , he ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable . and all his actions were uncouth , noisy , and greedy , some of his teeth had failed him since i saw him eat on the marshes .
he stayed on [male] , enduring as best he might the mute observation of the household . and the gentle irony of mr. [male] 's attentions . and before he left lynbrook , two days later . a provisional understanding had been reached , before leaving lynbrook he had had a last word with miss brent . not a word of confidence -- for the same sense of reserve kept both from any explicit renewal of their moment 's intimacy .
they looked so like new england , he declared . that he felt as if he must get a girl at once . and go and walk in the graveyard , -- a pastime which he remembered as universal in his native town . various cakes and puddings appeared to attest the industry of the housekeepers . and on the only wet evening , when a wild thunder gust was sweeping down the valley .
the horse , stiffening out its legs , with an effort stopped its rapid course . and the officer of the horse guards looked round him like a man waking up from a heavy sleep . and just managed to smile , a crowd of friends and outsiders pressed round him . vronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of the upper world . which was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the pavilions .
on he went at speed for here the land was level . and to his joy he lost sight of his pursuer . but presently there came a mile of rocky ground , and when it was past . glancing back he saw that nahoon was once more in his old place . his horse 's strength was almost spent , but hadden spurred it forward blindly .
rather to her disappointment , [female] owned she had heard of the sum his master had paid him for his invention . [male] 's heart filled with love at this new proof of [female] 's goodness . but she could not talk about it , she took [female] hand . and pressed it with affection ; and then turned the subject to will . her sailor nephew , [female] was a little bit sorry .
she had not lady [female] delight in managing a great house . she was sincerely anxious that her guests might be pleased , but somewhat over burdened by the responsibility of pleasing them . it was only after some experience that she found there was very little to be done , after all . with a skilful combination of elements , the result was sure to be agreeable . morning after morning the cheerful faces gathered round the breakfast table .
and [female] ran back to the bastion , mounted the platform . and bore off the flag ; but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range . they opened a terrible fire upon this man . who appeared to expose himself for pleasure 's sake . but [male] might be said to bear a charmed life , the balls passed and whistled all around him .
amongst this flock of returning pilgrims came [male] . very much the worse for two or three months spent in restless meanderings between [male] and hombourg . with the consciousness of a large income at his disposal . and a certain reckless indifference as to which way his life drifted . that had grown upon him of late years , he met mr. and mrs. granger within twenty-four hours of his arrival in [location] .
she remembered very well that great red brick building . a centrepiece with two wings , surrounded by high iron railings lined with gloomy shrubs . the long straight walks , the dismal trees arow , where pale faced men walked or rested feebly . had impressed themselves on her young mind . thin , patient men , pacing their [location] , she had wondered who they were .
a scheme of happiness at once rational and refined soon presented itself to her imagination . she purposed , for the basis of her plan . to become [female] of her own time , and with this view . to drop all idle and uninteresting acquaintance , who , while they contribute neither to use nor pleasure . make so large a part of the community , that they may properly be called the underminers of existence .
at the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the silver coin . seized it , and straightened himself up again and began to gaze afar off over the plain . at the same time casting his eyes towards all points of the horizon . as he stood there erect and shivering , like a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge . he saw nothing , night was falling .
sage mothers fanned themselves . and hoped she might not be too youthful and inconstant for the quiet round of home . impetuous fathers fell into disgrace for too much exaltation of her beauty . daughters envied her ; sons envied him . innumerable pairs of lovers profited by the occasion .
punctual to the time , appeared the carriage and the secretary . he sat on the box , and mr [male] graced the rumble . so , to the three magpies as before : where mrs [female] and miss [female] were handed out . and whence they all went on foot to mrs [female] . but , on the way down , they had stopped at a toy shop .
it was proved that they had been seen in the neighbourhood both before and after the murder . that boots found in the cottage at pycroft common fitted certain footmarks in the mud of the farmer 's yard . that burrows had been supplied with a certain poison at a county chemist 's at lavington . and that the dog bone 'm had been poisoned with the like , many other matters were proved . all of which were declared by the lawyer from devizes to amount to nothing , and by the police authorities .
so a little effort to lighten or expedite his work , a little leniency in excusing the dilatory finishing of a job . a little easing up under stress of weather , are taken as so many indications of a desire to conciliate . and conciliation means weakness every time . your lumber jack likes to be met front to front , one strong man to another . as you value your authority .
ah , i am sorry , good-bye , my dear young friend . it 's been a great pleasure to know you . colville walked down to the door of the hotel with his visitor and parted with him there . as he turned back he met the landlord . who asked him if he would have the omnibus for the station .
the spring after his father died , he put his plan into execution . he had wound up the work of the warerooms and with a [male] deliberation had studied out a tour . he made [male] his confidante . and now , having gathered together their traveling comforts they took a steamer from [location] to liverpool . after a few weeks in the british isles they went to [location] .
i must tell you ; i must put into words the dreadful secret which she believed that bit of paper had revealed to her . that corner of stiff , shining , thick , writing paper . she recognised as a part of the sheet on which she had copied [female] bamford 's beautiful lines so many months ago . copied on the blank part of a [female] sent to her by [female] . in those days when she did not treasure and hoard up everything he had touched .
as greisse had already paid his modest bill , amounting altogether to little more than three francs . this was kind of the young landlord , and while he was eating his bread and ham he promised faithfully that he would give the message just as [male] had given it to him . it was on the third day after the departure of edmond greisse that [male] told madame faragon that he was going home . `` going where , [female] ? '' said madame faragon . leaning forward on the table before her , and looking like a picture of despair .
it was impossible for the man to forget the bitterness of the child . besides , had not the same spirit of rivalry ripened . until he found his brother in manhood still his successful rival with [male] huntington ? the reader will remember that they had all three been children together . and that the last time [male] had looked back at his home .
at twenty minutes to eleven [female] descended the stairs and . walking quickly through the vestibule , emerged into russell square . there were but few people about , and no one seemed to notice the little figure which stood in indecision on the curb . even had they done so it would have taken a student of human physiognomy of no mean order to read what was written on [female] 's face . some would have said that there was an expression of sorrow behind the eyes .
then farewell my trim built wherry , oars and coat and badge farewell ! never more at chelsea ferry , shall your [male] take a spell ! my father got over it , mr [male] . and so shall i , while delivering these valedictory observations , [male] continually disappointed mr [male] of his hand by flourishing it in the air . he now darted it at his patron .
it was a glimpse of truth divine unto my spirit given . illumined by a [female] of light that shone direct from heaven . i felt there was a god on high , by whom all things were made . i saw his wisdom and his power in all his works displayed . but most throughout the moral world , i saw his glory shine .
while emil and carl were amusing themselves at the fair . alexandra was at home , busy with her account books . which had been neglected of late , she was almost through with her figures when she heard a cart drive up to the gate . and looking out of the window she saw her two older brothers . they had seemed to avoid her ever since [female] arrival .
he told father layonne he was afraid all fingers knowledge of the law could do him but little good . that fingers had told him as much , and the little missioner went away considerably depressed . he would talk with fingers again , he said . and offer certain suggestions he had in mind .
[male] smiled with an amused twitch about his mouth . but he said nothing , he rarely did say anything about himself . not even in his own household , the glory of his life was its unconsciousness . like our own silent severn , however broad and grand its current might be , that course seemed the natural channel into which it flowed . often thus the child slipped away , and suddenly we heard all over the house the sweet sounds of `` muriel 's voice , ''
unable thus to turn without meeting them , and caught like an eel in a water pipe . [male] drew nearer and nearer to the fateful shore . but he did not relinquish hope , just ahead there were cross roads . and he might have a chance of slipping down one of them without being seen . on reaching the spot he found that he was not alone .
gilbert and [female] , happily unconscious that their future was thus being settled by mrs. [female] . were sauntering through the shadows of the haunted wood , beyond , the harvest hills were basking in an amber sunset radiance . under a pale , aerial sky of rose and blue , the distant spruce groves were burnished bronze . and their long shadows barred the upland meadows , but around them a little wind sang among the fir tassels . and in it there was the note of autumn .
he stumbled blindly on , hunting for a way out , and finally , through webs of twisted branches . caught sight of a rift in the trees where the unbroken lightning showed open country . he rushed to the edge of the woods and then hesitated whether or not to cross the fields and try to reach the shelter of the little house marked by a light far down the valley . it was only half past five , but he could see scarcely ten steps before him . except when the lightning made everything vivid and grotesque for great sweeps around .
now at last felipe felt sure that she was dead , it was useless searching farther . yet , after he reached home , his restless conjectures took one more turn . and he sat down and wrote a letter to every priest between san [male] and monterey . asking if there were on his books a record of the marriage of one alessandro assis and ramona ortegna . this last faint hope also failed , no record anywhere of an alessandro assis .
i have no news for you at all of anyone . all inside the house is a simmer of [female] and quiet . with blinds drawn down against the heat the whole day long , no callers . and as for me , i never call elsewhere , the gossips about here eke out a precarious existence by washing each other 's dirty linen in public . and the process never seems to result in any satisfactory cleansing , i avoid saying what news i trust tomorrow 's post bag may contain for me .
the gentleman bowed , and as he moved to stretch out his arm . emma saw the hand of a young woman throw something white . folded in a triangle , into his hat , the gentleman . picking up the fan , offered it to the lady respectfully . she thanked him with an inclination of the head .
his eyes followed a furrow in the white sand which led from where he sat bolstered against the tree down to his pack and the rock . it was the trail made by his body when she had dragged him up to the shelter and coolness of the timber . one of his laws of physical care was to keep himself trained down to a hundred and sixty . but he wondered how she had dragged up even so much as that of dead weight . it had taken a great deal of effort .
though very happy in the social atmosphere about her , and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort . jo still found time for literary labors . the purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl . but the means she took to gain her end were not the best . she saw that money conferred power .
i was , in fact , halfway through dinner when . without a word of warning , a man who seemed to enter with a lightfooted speed that . considering his size , was almost incredible , drew a chair toward him and took the vacant place at my table . my glass of wine and my plate were moved with smooth and marvelous haste to his vicinity . under cover of the tablecloth a packet .
he drew in a deep breath of utter weariness . and leaned forward , his elbows on his knees , his head in his hands . and gazed into the blazing fire , the memories which had taken possession of his soul during the long ride seemed to envelop him so that in a moment the present was swept away into oblivion and his spirit was . as it were , suddenly withdrawn from the body and projected into the past . he had been unable to touch any of the greasy cold stuff which had been offered him during the latter part of his journey .
[male] did not understand , while there was nothing in his heart that could teach him . he had found her : he would keep her , the orphans home should not have her , the law should not have her . only one possibility had any weight with [male] . if some one like mr. [male] or miss winton wanted to give her a home of luxury .
apart from the information given by the mortons [female] felt already familiar with the great churches and quaint streets . and for her rouen never quite lost the halo of romance that mademoiselle vire had endowed it with . it was the second day of their stay . and after a morning of wandering about the town , both [female] and her aunt were resting . the former on the balcony in front of her room .
she then told her that she was now quite rich . for while she was gone , a gentleman had come into the room . who had given her five guineas , [female] , by her description . soon found this gentleman was mr arnott , and a charity so sympathetic with her own . failed not to raise him greatly in her favour , but as her benevolence was a stranger to that parade which is only liberal from emulation .
he took it out into the open , away from the immediate danger of a collision with a tree . and squared himself to break it in , he got it going at last . cheered by loud whoops of admiration and encouragement . and rode it straight into the fire , he scattered sticks and coals and bore a wabbling course ahead . his friends after him , shouting and waving hats .
it was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance . not one of the sailors , all fishermen of the coast . recently levied for the service , dared to attempt it , in the meantime . the unfortunate topman was losing his strength ; his anguish could not be discerned on his face . but his exhaustion was visible in every limb ; his arms were contracted in horrible twitchings .
she stood her ground . facing him with a quick lift of the head . `` if you do not let me go i certainly am , '' she said . and he drew back , as if conscious of the uselessness of the struggle . his submission , as usual , had a disarming effect on her irritation .
[male] had not heard much of this conversation , having given his attention elsewhere . but the glimpses he had of [male] 's manner deepened the impression that it had something newly artificial . later , in the drawing room , [female] , at somebody 's request . sat down to the piano and sang , afterward , mrs. [female] took his place . and on rising he observed that [female] had left her seat .
his heart thumped against his ribs as he hurried down the ridge in the direction of [male] 's voice . the giant wedge of the forest was not burning . yet , and audemard was hurrying like mad toward the tip of that wedge . crying out now and then the name of the broken man , and always he kept ahead . until at last -- a mile from the ridge -- [male] came to the edge of a wide stream and saw what it was that made the wedge of forest .
thus they arrived at the demand upon the congregation . if they could show any just cause why these two persons might not lawfully be joined together . now to speak -- and the pause here was so long , and so over powering . that old [male] said `` nay '' ; and then gave a nervous sob , the bridegroom turned and smiled in the direction of the voice . and the doctor , leaning forward , laid his hand on the trembling shoulder .
[male] and nan took all the time they could spare from their studies to enjoy high jinks at plumfield with their old friends . for emil 's next voyage was to be a long one , [organization] 's absence was uncertain . and no one ever knew when [male] would turn up again , they all seemed to feel that life was beginning to grow serious . and even while they enjoyed those lovely summer days together they were conscious that they were children no longer . and often in the pauses of their fun talked soberly of their plans and hopes .
then it befell that king anguish of [location] sent to king mark of cornwall for the tribute long paid him . but now seven years behind , king mark and his barons gave unto the messenger of [location] the answer that they would no tribute pay . and bade him tell his king that if he wished tribute he should send a trusty knight of his land to fight for it against another that cornwall should find to defend its right . with this the messenger departed into [location] , when king anguish understood the answer . he was wonderfully wroth , and called unto him sir marhaus .
that slumber in that isolation , and with a neighbor like himself . had about it something sublime , of which he was vaguely but imperiously conscious . his eye never quitted the old man , the only thing which was clearly to be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision . one would have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses , -- the one in which one loses one 's self and that in which one saves one 's self . he seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that hand .
`` how is it pointing ? '' asked [male] , riding a hundred paces toward the whip who had sighted the hare . but before the whip could reply , the hare , scenting the frost coming next morning . was unable to rest and leaped up , the pack on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare . and from all sides the borzois that were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare . all the hunt , who had been moving slowly , shouted , `` stop , '' calling in the hounds .
i am , if you will be so good as to remember , constitutionally french . and , therefore , constitutionally averse to distressing myself , if i can possibly help it . for this reason , i really can not summon courage to describe what passed between my blind lucilla and me when i returned to our pretty sitting room . she made me cry at the time . and she would make me cry again now , if i wrote the little melancholy story of what this tender young creature suffered when i told her my miserable news .
[female] was amused by [female] 's manner of being grateful . and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of [female] 's views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the musgrove family . she had only time , however , for a general answer . and a wish that such another woman were at uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased . on seeing [female] and captain wentworth coming towards them .
in these pages , however , and after the time that has now elapsed , no such cautions and restraints as are here described need fetter the free expression of my opinion . i will state briefly . before my pen occupies itself with other events . how my own convictions lead me to account for the abstraction of the keys . for the outbreak of the fire , and for the death of the man .
young massy obeyed , and not without difficulty they succeeded at last in disengaging the almost lifeless form of a man whose dark domino was perfectly saturated with fresh blood . his half mask still covered his face . and , to screen his features from the vulgar gaze of the crowd . they suffered it to remain there , up the wide stairs and into a spacious salon they now carried the figure . whose drooping head and hanging limbs gave little signs of life .
his daughter [female] gently tried to calm him . but he would not on any account be calmed , he said his spirit was up . and would not endure this , was he to be told that , he wished to know again . by his own son on his own hearth , to his own face ? was that humiliation to be put upon him by his own blood ?
fanny did not answer , and as [female] just then approached , and asked her to go to the music room . she took his arm readily , glad to escape so painful a conversation . this was the impression left on [male] 's mind . which was productive of much mischief , at a late hour the company dispersed . [female] returned home , weary and sick at heart .
here the young gentleman brought forward his hand , in it was a nondescript little wad . well soaked and shapeless ; but , once he had untied the kid , such a [male] of [male] light burst from his outstretched palm that i doubt if a single woman there noted the clatter of the retiring beast or the heavy clang made by the two front doors as they shut upon the robber . eyes and tongues were too busy , and mr. [male] . realizing , probably , that the interest of all present would remain , for a few minutes at least . with this marvelous jewel so astonishingly recovered , laid it , with many expressions of thankfulness .
she did not hesitate to own to herself that this [female] was very lovely , she too . herself , was beautiful , she too had a reputation for [female] . loveliness , and feminine high bred charm , she knew all that . but she knew also that her attractions were not so bright as those of her rival . she could not smile or laugh and throw sparks of brilliance around her as did the [female] girl .
perhaps they felt this , too , perhaps even these hardened men and the more than hardened woman whose presence was in itself a [female] . recognized heroism when they saw it . for when the lawyer , with a certain obvious reluctance , laid his hand on the bolts of the door with the remark . `` this is not my work , you know ; i am but following out instructions very minutely given me , '' the smothered growls and grunts which rose in reply lacked the venom which had been infused into all their previous comments .
she did well enough without them -- perfection of fit . proportion of form , [female] of carriage . agreeably supplied their place , her eye , as she re entered the small sitting room . instantly sought mine , which was just then lingering on the hearth ; i knew she read at once the sort of inward [female] and pitying pain which the chill vacancy of that hearth stirred in my soul . quick to penetrate , quick to determine , and quicker to put in practice , she had in a moment tied a [female] apron round her waist .
at midnight [male] crept noiselessly to the bedroom . the condition was unaltered , he was going to lie down , but wished to be awakened if there was any change . it was long before he dropped off , and he seemed to have slept only a moment when there was a knocking at his door . he heard it while he was still sleeping . the dawn had broken , the streamers of the sun were rising out of the sea .
the night was cold and stormy , the wind roared round the house . and the rain beat against the windows . but [male] , all happiness within , regarded it not . [male] slept through every blast ; and the travellers . they had a rich reward in store .
never did mr. [male] 's manner bear richer witness to what could be extracted from hanaford than when he was in the act of applying to it the powerful pressure of his hospitality . the resultant essence was so bubbling with social exhilaration that , to its producer at any rate . its somewhat mixed ingredients were lost in one highly flavoured draught , under ordinary circumstances no one discriminated more keenly than mr. [male] between different shades of social importance . but any one who was entertained by him was momentarily ennobled by the fact , and not all the anxious telegraphy of his wife and daughters could . for instance , recall to him that the striking young woman in mrs. [female] 's wake was only some obscure protegee .
lady caroline , he judged , had nothing on hers at the moment . but so much beauty -- for he could not but see what was evident -- must have had its difficulties in the past and would have more of them before it had done . in the past he had not been at hand . in the future he hoped to be , and meanwhile the behaviour of mrs. [female] . the next in importance of the ladies from the professional point of view .
it 's queer what a mixture the registrar can make in the matter of room mates . [female] thinks everything is funny . even flunking -- and [female] is bored at everything . she never makes the slightest effort to be amiable , she believes that if you are a [female] . that fact alone admits you to heaven without any further examination .
only a sculptor of the finest imagination , the most delicate taste . the sweetest feeling , and the rarest artistic skill -- in a word . a sculptor and a poet too -- could have first dreamed of a faun in this guise . and then have succeeded in imprisoning the sportive and frisky thing in marble , neither man nor animal . and yet no monster , but a being in whom both races meet on friendly ground .
as soon as prince [male] observed that the destined queen of the day had arrived upon the field . assuming that air of courtesy which sat well upon him when he was pleased to exhibit it . he rode forward to meet her , doffed his bonnet . and , alighting from his horse , assisted the lady rowena from her saddle . while his followers uncovered at the same time , and one of the most distinguished dismounted to hold her palfrey .
with a mad roar , gibbs recovered himself and rushed at his antagonist . it was a terrific struggle ; not the skillful sparring of trained fighters . but the rough and tumble battling of primitive giants , it was the climax of long months of hatred . the meeting of two who were by every instinct mortal enemies , ollie shrank back in terror . but sammy leaned forward in the saddle , her beautiful figure tense .
no , i am not half sleepy enough , sleepy , did i say ? i feel as if i should never close my eyes again . the bare anticipation of seeing that dear face , and hearing that well-known voice tomorrow . keeps me in a perpetual fever of excitement . if i only had the privileges of a man , i would order out sir [male] 's best horse instantly . and tear away on a night gallop , eastward , to meet the rising sun -- a long .
alice consented to come down to breakfast without any immediate continuance of her active preparations for going . and at last , of course , she stayed , when she entered the breakfast room mr [male] came up to her . and offered her his hand , she had no alternative but to take it . and then seated herself , that there was an intended apology in the manner in which he offered her toast and butter . she was convinced ; and the special courtesy with which he handed her to the carriage .
troy entered the carrier 's house . which had been the place of his lodging on his last visit to his native place . [male] was moved by a sudden determination , he hastened home . in ten minutes he was back again , and made as if he were going to call upon troy at the carrier 's . but as he approached , some one opened the door and came out , he heard this person say `` good night ''
and , in fact , a knock at the door was heard at that moment . [male] was not mistaken ; for it was indeed [male] who adopted that mode of announcing himself . we have seen how he passed the night in philosophizing with [male] . but the musketeer was very weary even of feigning to fall asleep , and as soon as earliest dawn illumined with its gloomy gleams of light the sumptuous cornices of the superintendent 's room . [male] rose from his armchair , arranged his sword .
a drive is always [female] , besides , one can talk about some things with more freedom in a carriage than face to face in one 's room . the horses require attention at critical moments . and there are always points of interest when it is important that conversation should be deflected from the subject in hand . so since mrs. [female] was willing , [female] turned into the park . for an hour they drove along its shady .
then she broke away , and flew up stairs , [female] came in again to me . and sat down , he did not speak for many minutes , after an interval . i know not how long -- we heard mrs. tod calling loudly for `` mr . [male] . '' we both ran through the empty kitchen to the foot of the stairs that led to mr. [male] 's room . mr. [male] 's room , alas , he owned nothing now on this fleeting .
but the ring , and her aunt 's triumphant eye . and a note of approval in her father 's manner . and a novel disposition in him to praise manning in a just . impartial voice had soon placed very definite qualifications upon that covenanted secrecy . but the ramage affair needed clearing up , of course .
he could have told nothing about the other , except that he was a respectable old man . one of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with the other , gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events . the bedroom had turned into a hiding place at a very opportune moment . montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour . in such a place , betokened something threatening .
`` what murderous deed do you intend ? '' cried sir [male] indomitably . he had risen and stood grimly dignified in his bonds . `` will you murder your own brother as you murdered mine ? '' demanded [female] , speaking now for the first time . and rising as she spoke , a faint flush coming to overspread her pallor .
all this , like the other parts of the disposition , was not and could not be executed . after passing through borodino the vice king was driven back to the kolocha and could get no farther . while the divisions of morand and gerard did not take the redoubt but were driven back . and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry ( a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by [male] ) . so not one of the orders in the disposition was , or could be , executed . but in the disposition it is said that .
others surmised that she was the duke 's daughter . hints were , of course , thrown out as to a connection of another kind . but with no great vigour , as it was admitted on all hands that lady [female] . the duke 's niece by marriage . and the mother of the duke 's future heir .
`` so early as that , '' i said , but i could not find it in my heart to pursue this discussion in a jocular tone . i submitted to her several obvious arguments , dictated apparently by common sense but in reality by my secret compassion . mrs. [female] brushed them aside . with the semi conscious egoism of all safe , established , existences , they had known each other so little . just three weeks , and of that time , too short for the birth of any serious sentiment .
her lips were twisted in pain at sight of him . she spoke no word , but a strange sound rose in her throat . a welling up of the sudden despair which the fire light revealed in her eyes . for one moment they stood apart , and [male] tried to speak . and then , suddenly , he reached out and drew her quickly into his arms .
then after this soon they had sight of land . and sailed till they arrived at barflete in flanders . and when they were there he found many of his great lords ready . as they had been commanded to wait upon him , chapter v. how a man of the country told to him of a marvellous giant . and how he fought and conquered him , and it fortuned they came to the place whereas the two knights were and kept [male] 's horse .
the girl thereupon fell into such deep reflection that conversation languished . and grammer [female] , taking her candle . wished miss [female] good night , the latter 's eyes rested on the distant glimmer . around which she allowed her reasoning fancy to play in vague eddies that shaped the doings of the philosopher behind that light on the lines of intelligence just received . it was strange to her to come back from the world to little hintock and find in one of its nooks .
i rose up suddenly , terror struck at the solitude which so ruthless a judge haunted . at the silence which so awful a voice filled , my head swam as i stood erect . i perceived that i was sickening from excitement and inanition . neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day . for i had taken no breakfast , and , with a strange pang .
captain , what use is that when you have often said that a mother can and ought to commit any crime for her child ? i implore you as a wounded man begs for a death blow . to tell me all , do not you see i am as helpless as a child ? do not you hear me complaining as to a mother ? wo not you forget that i am a man .
when she came downstairs , she found sir [male] ffoulkes sitting in the coffee room . he had been out half an hour earlier , and had gone to the admiralty pier . only to find that neither the french packet nor any privately chartered vessel could put out of [male] yet . the storm was then at its fullest , and the tide was on the turn . if the wind did not abate or change , they would perforce have to wait another ten or twelve hours until the next tide .
as soon as [male] , sitting at the head of prince [male] 's bed . heard of princess [female] 's arrival . she softly left his room and hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to princess [female] . princess [female] , with her acute sensibility . understood all this at the first glance at [female] 's face .
up to that time , the republic , the empire . had been to him only monstrous words , the republic . a guillotine in the twilight ; the empire . a sword in the night , he had just taken a look at it . and where he had expected to find only a chaos of shadows .
one thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated : our current was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out . pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound , and next moment we guessed what it was . it was a surprise in force coming ! i whispered [male] to go and wake the army . and notify it to wait in silence in the cave for further orders .
`` but i will have the lantern going full blast , '' she said . and then allowed him to lead her into the narrow passageway , she closed the panel and then felt about with her foot until it located the lantern . in a minute they had a light . `` now , do not be afraid , '' she said encouragingly , he laughed in pure delight . she misunderstood his mirth and was conscious of a new and an almost unendurable pang .
[male] did him justice . but she wondered what his purpose was and what he expected to gain even by proving the superior strain of his sincerity . if he expected to melt her by showing what a good fellow he was . he might spare himself the trouble . she knew the superior strain of everything about him .
`` thank you , '' she murmured again . lowering her head as he passed , when the door had closed on him she thrust the last pin into her hair . dashed some drops of cologne on her face . and went over to the writing table , as she picked up the cheque she saw it was for three hundred dollar . once or twice , in the days that followed , [female] found herself thinking that she had never known happiness before .
he did not answer , except to continue to caress her , he did not say good night until she had become supple to his gentle , seductive entreaties . when mr. pontellier learned of his wife 's intention to abandon her home and take up her residence elsewhere . he immediately wrote her a letter of unqualified disapproval and remonstrance . she had given reasons which he was unwilling to acknowledge as adequate . he hoped she had not acted upon her rash impulse .
between the veranda and the river meadows . out on which it looked , all was garden , orange grove . and almond orchard ; the orange grove always green . never without snowy bloom or golden fruit ; the garden never without flowers . summer or winter ; and the almond orchard .
a female , therefore , should learn the kama shastra . or at least a part of it , by studying its practice from some confidential friend . she should study alone in private the sixty four practices that form a part of the kama shastra . her teacher should be one of the following persons , viz. , the daughter of a nurse brought up with her and already married . or a female friend who can be trusted in everything , or the sister of her mother .
the buildings were long and low , in order to avoid the rough violence of the winds that swept over that wild . bleak spot , both in winter and summer . it was well for the inhabitants of that house that coal was extremely cheap . otherwise a southerner might have imagined that they could never have survived the cutting of the bitter gales that piped all round . and seemed to seek out every crevice for admission into the house .
sometimes , it seemed to mrs crich as if her husband were some subtle funeral bird . feeding on the miseries of the people , it seemed to her he was never satisfied unless there was some sordid tale being poured out to him . which he drank in with a sort of mournful , sympathetic satisfaction . he would have no raison d'etre if there were no lugubrious miseries in the world . as an undertaker would have no meaning if there were no funerals .
there was a sofa where mr. [male] stood . and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the dying gladiator . still in that attitude he said , with a hollow voice . `` good night , mr. [male] , '' when i deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him .
women came out of their houses and crossed to the doors of neighbours to look after her . even the boys playing at the corners looked up as she went by . she was not greatly observed for all that , an unusual interest agitated the town . a wave of commotion flowed down the streets . the traffic went in one direction , that direction was the court house .
he passed on out of sight , and unlocked and unbarred a low door in the corner of the chamber . `` now , '' said he , as he opened it and appeared within . `` come out , '' there is no sort of whiteness in all the hues under the sun at all like the whiteness of [male] 's face as it was then . neither is there any expression of the human countenance at all like that expression in every little line of which the frightened heart is seen to beat . both are conventionally compared with death ; but the difference is the whole deep gulf between the struggle done .
but he shook with so palsied a fury that for a time he could only surrender to his physical weakness . with a mighty effort he braced his withered body and pulled himself forward . he knew he was killing himself . but he would fall at his sentry post . challenging the enemy , [male] , himself oblivious until now to all but his own earnestness .
usually , on nights like this , for there had been many lately , he could escape from this consuming introspection by thinking of children and the infinite possibilities of children . he leaned and listened and he heard a startled baby awake in a house across the street and lend a tiny whimper to the still night . quick as a flash he turned away . wondering with a touch of panic whether something in the brooding despair of his mood had made a darkness in its tiny soul , he shivered . what if some day the balance was overturned , and he became a thing that frightened children and crept into rooms in the dark .
i sent for her to see me in my room . and showed her my letter , i never remember , at any other time . such a sense of helplessness and confusion as came over me when she had closed the door . i set to work to pack up the few things i wanted for the journey . feeling instinctively that if i did not occupy myself in doing something .
fanny [female] has behaved so well , it was she who told that her brother had been out at night . mr. [male] says that when the question was asked in his presence . she answered it in her own quiet , simple way . without a moment 's doubt ; but since that she has never ceased to assert her conviction that her brother has had nothing to do either with the murder or with the robbery . if it had not been for this , mrs. [female] would .
to be sure they always wasted a good deal of time getting in each other 's way and giggling at each other 's mistakes . but , as alexandra had pointedly told her sisters in law . it was to hear them giggle that she kept three young things in her kitchen . the work she could do herself . if it were necessary , these girls , with their long letters from home .
it was flagged ; but the pavement had rotted and cracked under the oozing of the water . eight feet above the floor , a long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side to side . from this beam hung , at short distances apart . chains three feet long , and at the end of these chains there were rings for the neck . in this vault , men who had been condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the day of their departure for toulon .
the interior of the hut was chiefly occupied by two beds . one was empty , but composed of collected leaves , and spread with an antelope 's hide . it seemed , from the articles of armour laid beside it . and from a crucifix of silver , carefully and reverentially disposed at the head . to be the couch of the knight himself .
mr. [male] , who had recently come from [location] . broke the news to his unhappy brother , terrible was the anguish of [male] . when he became convinced that he must lose her , nothing could induce him to leave her room . and as if endowed with superhuman strength , he watched by her constantly . only leaving her once each day to visit the quiet grave , the bed of his other daughter .
there was no longer any doubt that [female] had left the house at this midnight hour . and whither could she have gone ? to follow her was almost impossible , had the dwelling stood in an ordinary road . two persons setting out , one in each direction , might have made sure of overtaking her . but it was a hopeless task to seek for anybody on a heath in the dark . the practicable directions for flight across it from any point being as numerous as the meridians radiating from the pole .
but a curious thing had happened , harvey gave her no moral support . he brought her only disapproval . she found herself remembering none of the loving things he had said to her . but only the bitter ones , perhaps it was the best thing for her , after all . for a sort of dogged determination to go through with it all .
yet there was everything against this , and it was , indeed , a last resort . it seemed now , however , that another way was open , it was exceedingly probable that mr. [male] was off for his last visit to the prisoner . and , since a magistrate was with him , it was exceedingly improbable that he would take the paper with him . it was not the kind of paper . if , indeed , it existed at all -- that more persons would be allowed to see than were parties to the very discreditable affair .
while she waited his return , davison came from mr harrel . who had ordered him to run instantly for the jew , mr arnott was more than half an hour with the people . and when , at last , he returned , his countenance immediately proclaimed the ill success of his errand . the creditors , he said , declared they had so frequently been deceived . that they would not dismiss the bailiffs , or retire themselves .
in his joy he cried out , a western breeze brought him air that he drank in as a desert stricken man drinks water . he did not look at his compass again , but worked steadily in the face of that fresh air . an hour later he found that he was paddling again a slow current . and when he tasted the water it was only slightly tainted with sulphur . by midnight the water was cool and clean , he landed on a shore of sand and pebbles .
the inky devil had forced him to ask the question even before they had reached [female] . `` does it matter ? '' she had asked , then for the time he had repudiated his solicitude . and had declared that no question of money was of much consequence to him . thereby making his future task with her so much the more difficult , after that he said nothing to her on the subject on that their wedding day . but he could not prevent himself from thinking of it .
with consequences untold but terrible , and , above all things , she was never to pick up an old comb in the road . for as like as not the comb would be the property of the banshee . a little old woman with long nails and hairy arms . when gabrielle asked what would happen if she picked up the banshee 's comb . [female] told her that the banshee would come crying to her window at night .
after ascending and descending several steps in the corridors , which were so dark that they were lighted by lamps at midday . [female] , still surrounded by her lugubrious escort , was thrust by the police into a gloomy chamber . this chamber , circular in form . occupied the ground floor of one of those great towers . which , even in our own century , still pierce through the layer of modern edifices with which modern [location] has covered ancient [location] .
philip put one hand affectionately on his shoulder . the eyes of the robustious fellow began to blink , and he returned to his colleagues . there was a confused murmur beyond the farther wall of the room . it was the room kept for the deemster when he held court in the council chamber . one of its two doors communicated with the bench , as usual , a constable kept this door .
and then , suddenly , the vision clouded , and there came into jolly [male] 's face the look of a man who knew . when he stood the truth out naked -- that he was facing a world with his back to the wall . and now , as the sun went down , and his supper waited -- that cloud which came to blot out his picture grew deeper and more sinister . and the chill of it entered his heart . he turned from his table to the open door .
at this hour the lonely dwelling was closely blinded and shuttered from the chill and darkness without . wildeve 's clandestine plan with her was to take a little gravel in his hand and hold it to the crevice at the top of the window shutter . which was on the outside , so that it should fall with a gentle rustle . resembling that of a mouse , between shutter and glass . this precaution in attracting her attention was to avoid arousing the suspicions of her grandfather .
they sat with tea and strawberries and cream before them at a little table in front of the pavilion in regent 's park . her confession was still unmade , manning leaned forward on the table . talking discursively on the probable brilliance of their married life , [female] sat back in an attitude of inattention . her eyes on a distant game of cricket . her mind perplexed and busy , she was recalling the circumstances under which she had engaged herself to manning .
he also explained to them in a few words the object that had brought them there . and the strange nature of [male] 's madness . and how they were waiting for his squire , who had gone in search of him . like the recollection of a dream , the quarrel he had had with [male] came back to [male] 's memory . and he described it to the others .
`` well , then , we wo not talk of him at all , i was so surprised when he began to speak , so -- '' and cynthia looked very lovely , blushing and dimpling up as she remembered his words and looks . suddenly she recalled herself to the present time . and her eye caught on the leaf full of blackberries . the broad green leaf , so fresh and crisp when molly had gathered it an hour or so ago .
that pale face and flaming glance appeared to villefort like a frightful apparition . each time he had been brought into contact with his father . something terrible had happened , `` see what they have done , '' cried [male] . with one hand leaning on the back of the chair . and the other extended towards [male] , `` see , my father , see ! ''
the season was not quick in opening , to the applebys the time between mid may and mid june was crawlingly slow . on some days they had two orders . some days , none at all , of an evening . before they could sink into the sunset colored [female] of the rose arbor . they had to convince themselves that they could not really expect any business till the summerites had begun to take their vacations .
mrs. [female] looked very attentively at the patient . curtseyed to lady [female] , set one or two little things right in the room . and sat down quietly in a corner to wait until she was wanted , her ladyship seemed startled and annoyed by the appearance of the strange nurse . no one said anything , for fear of rousing miss [female] . who was still slumbering , except the doctor , who whispered a question about the night .
past the spruces the lane dipped down into a sunny little open where a log bridge spanned a brook . and then came the glory of a sunlit beechwood where the air was like transparent golden wine . and the leaves fresh and green , and the wood floor a mosaic of tremulous [male] . then more wild cherries , and a little valley of lissome firs . and then a hill so steep that the girls lost their breath climbing it .
it was not long before one of those flat , low , dark clipper schooners hove in sight and ran into the bay . she was small , sat deep in the water . was scarcely three hundred tons burthen , but managed to stow three hundred and forty negroes with ease . and would have taken more had not intelligence from the lookouts been brought in , that a square rig was coming down the coast . [male] bramble hesitated whether he should embark in this craft .
but she said nothing , merely allowing her hand to rest with his beneath the thin . dry hand of the dying woman , to her aunt . however , when for a moment they were alone together , she showed all possible affection . with thanks and tears , and warm kisses . and prayers for forgiveness as to all those matters in which she had offended .
at the close , waiting yet another minute , he said in a clear loud voice . as he had said in the village at that hour and season for the previous forty years -- a [male] christmas to ye , when the expectant stillness consequent upon the exclamation had nearly died out of them all . an increasing light made itself visible in one of the windows of the upper floor . it came so close to the blind that the exact position of the flame could be perceived from the outside .
junior went to work , after a few tasks bunglingly performed , he was tried on messenger service and started with his carfare to deliver a box containing a funeral piece . he had no idea where he was to go . or what car line to take , in his extremity a bootblack came to his aid . he safely delivered the box at a residence where the owner was leaving his door for his car . he gave junior half a dollar .
she was gone forever , and yet she had come back to him . and the truth grew upon him that this spirit of her would never leave him again as long as he lived . he felt her nearness , unconsciously he reached out his arms . and a strange happiness entered into him to battle with grief and loneliness . his eyes shone with a new glow as they looked at her little belongings on the sunlit rock .
i had arranged , at my last visit to the metropolis . to have our modest domestic establishment ready to receive [male] when we arrived in [location] by the early train . in consequence of this wise precaution . we were enabled that same day to play the third move in the game . the getting possession of [male] , dates are of importance here .
i have only her letters to guide me . and on the most important of all the questions which our correspondence can discuss , every one of those letters leaves me in the dark . does he treat her kindly ? is she happier now than she was when i parted with her on the wedding day ? all my letters have contained these two inquiries , put more or less directly , now in one form . and now in another , and all , on that point only , have remained without reply .
as he that tells the tale saw once a great piece of a promontory . that had a sapling growing on it , slide from the long shore cliff 's windy walls to the beach . and there lie still , and yet the sapling grew : so lay the man transfixt . his craven pair of comrades making slowlier at the prince . when now they saw their bulwark fallen , stood ; on whom the [male] .
secondly , because wherever there was a square yard of ground in british occupation under the sun or moon . with a public post upon it , sticking to that post was a [male] . no intrepid navigator could plant a flag staff upon any spot of earth . and take possession of it in the british name . but to that spot of earth , so soon as the discovery was known .
thus faring , he rode for two days and met with naught . on the third day the weather was hot about noon . and sir [male] had great list to sleep , he espied a great apple tree full of white blossoms . and a fair shadow was beneath it , and he alighted and tied his horse unto a thorn . and laid his helmet under his head and slept .
the social and business worlds of [location] . [location] , [male] , and other cities saw . during the year or two which followed the breaking of his relationship with [male] . a curious rejuvenation in the social and business spirit of [male] . he had become rather distant and indifferent to certain personages and affairs while he was living with her .
mademoiselle requested that ces messieurs would give themselves the pain of walking into the garden . she would descend almost at once , he imagined himself waiting to welcome margot . beautiful margot , returning from [location] to him . he would have to go to liverpool , of course , she would be handsomer than ever . probably , and he could picture their meeting , seven or eight weeks from now .
as if with the utterance of the words , the very core and fiber of resolution melted away and vanished . and the broken spirit turned writhing and shuddering from the phantom that extended its arms for the sacrifice . he flung his arms upon the table . his shoulders heaved , i heard two suppressed , choked down sobs -- the sobs of a strong man . strong alike in body and mind ; strongest of all in the heart and spirit and purpose to love and cherish .
there appeared in the light of the hotel door for a moment the figures of struggling men . followed by the sound of feet in flight down the steps . and somebody mounting a horse in haste at the hotel hitching rack . whoever this was rode away at a hard gallop , [male] knew that the battle was over . and as he came to the hitching rack he saw that [male] 's horse was still there .
then , kneeling , sir [male] kissed the queen 's hand . and went from the prison ; and the people who had assembled outside at the noise of the fighting wondered to see only one knight issue forth . his armour dented and broken , and dabbled here and there with the blood of his wounds . sir [male] took his way to the lodging of sir [male] . who showed his great gladness to see him again , and when he had been unarmed and his wounds stanched and bound .
then lo , -- or i will not say lo , for no one can behold it . only feel , or but remember , what a real mother is , ever loving . ever soft , ever turning sin to goodness , vices into virtues . blind to all nine tenths of wrong ; through a telescope beholding faintest decimal of promise . even in her vilest child , ready to thank god again .
these lurking places refuse nobody . to fall in the social scale has a tendency to bring men to one level . sometimes honesty in tatters found itself there , virtue and probity have been known before now to be brought to strange passes . we must not judge always by appearances , even in the palace or at the galleys . public respect , as well as universal reprobation , requires testing , surprising results sometimes spring from this principle .
time will show , mr. [male] , i said -- time will show , i dare say if we look out for the marriage in the papers we shall not be far wrong . excuse my noticing it , but i am sorry to see you not looking so well as you were when we last met . a momentary nervous contraction quivered about his lips and eyes . and made me half reproach myself for having answered him in such a significantly guarded manner .
but cassandra rejected hampton court , [location] , [location] , and kew in favor of the zoological gardens . she had once trifled with the psychology of animals . and still knew something about inherited characteristics , on sunday afternoon . therefore , [location] , cassandra , and [female] drove off to the zoo . as their cab approached the entrance , [location] bent forward and waved her hand to a young man who was walking rapidly in the same direction .
lady [female] took the mourner up into her own room . and there made her a little speech , `` we have all wept for you , '' she said , and grieve for you still , but excessive grief is wicked . especially in the young , we will do our best to make you happy , and hope we shall succeed . all this about dear [female] ought to be a comfort to you .
he let down the wire and rode to meet her . troubled as before by that feeling of disloyalty to the [male] interests which caused him to stop more than once and debate whether he should turn back and wait inside the fence . the desire to hasten the meeting with [male] was stronger than this question of his loyalty . he went on , over the hill from which she used to spy on his passing . into the valley where he had interfered between the two girls on the day that he found [male] hidden away in this unexpected place .
`` i do not think you can see them , '' said miss tita with an extraordinary expression of entreaty in her eyes . as if the dearest hope she had in the world now was that i would not take them from her . but how could she expect me to make such a sacrifice as that after all that had passed between us ? what had i come back to [female] for but to see them , to take them ?
he sat in the darkness , massaging his bruised skull . his hours of imprisonment in the cupboard had had a bad effect on his nervous system . and he vacillated between tears of weakness and a militant desire to get at the cuckoo clock with a hatchet . he felt that it had done it on purpose and was now chuckling to itself in fancied security . for quite a minute he raged silently , and any cuckoo clock which had strayed within his reach would have had a bad time of it .
miss mackenzie did not answer the appeal that was made to her , she was watching mr rubb narrowly . and knew that he was making a fool of himself . she could perceive also that miss [male] would not spare him . she could forgive mr rubb for being a fool . she could forgive him for not knowing the meaning of words .
about this hour the snow abated : ten flakes fell where twenty had fallen . then one had the room of ten , not long after a form moved by the brink of the river . between each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen yards . it was evident now that the windows high in the wall were being counted . the word `` five '' represented the fifth window from the end of the wall .
when i say `` me , '' of course you will understand what `` me '' means . the better part of `` me '' is so prudent that i know she will not accept this view of things without ever so much consideration . and therefore she must come to clavering to hear it discussed by the elders , for myself . i can not bear to think that i should take delight in the results of this dreadful misfortune . but how am i to keep myself from being made happy by the feeling that we may now be married without further delay ?
it seemed to issue from a clump of bushes close by . but by this time i had come to the conclusion that there was a ventriloquism in this [location] voice which made it impossible for me to determine its exact direction . of one thing i was , however , now quite convinced , and that was that the singer had been following me all the time . again and again as i stood there listening it sounded , now so faint and apparently far off as to be scarcely audible . then all at once it would ring out bright and clear within a few yards of me .
he changed his hour , he changed his bench . he forgot his handkerchief , he came alone to the [location] . marius dashed headlong into all these snares ; and to all the interrogation marks planted by [male] in his pathway . he ingenuously answered `` yes , '' but cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity . so that [female] arrived at the following conclusion : that ninny is madly in love with cosette .
it was about an hour afterwards that [female] returned . and on this occasion a groom from the stables . and the young lord 's own servant , and two or three other men were with him . [male] had been made to understand that the news now to be communicated , must be communicated by himself . whether his lordship were angry or not , indeed , after what had been done his lordship 's anger was not of much moment .
[female] took her back to her mother 's in the gig . driving very slowly , and lifting her up and down as tenderly as if she had been a child . she breathed freely when she left elm cottage . but when she was settled in her own bedroom at `` the manx fairy '' she realised that she had only stepped from misery to misery .
so fair hands rode with the man until they came to where the knight lay bound . and the thieves hard by , fair hands struck one unto the death . and then another , and at the third stroke he slew the third thief . and then the other three fled , he rode after them and overtook them . and then those three thieves turned again and assailed fair hands hard , but at the last he slew them also .
boxes and lumber filled it ; old dresses draped its unstained wall . cobwebs its unswept ceiling , well was it known to be tenanted by rats . by [male] beetles , and by cockroaches . nay , rumour affirmed that the ghostly nun of the garden had once been seen here . a partial darkness obscured one end , across which , as for deeper mystery .
he had returned before his summoned visitors arrived ; and had time enough to recur to the evening on which [male] had made his confession . he remembered with mortification how he had forgotten his proud reserve . and his habitual concealment of his feelings , and had laid bare his agony of grief in the presence of these two men who were coming to see him by his desire . and he entrenched himself behind stiff barriers of self control . through which he hoped no appearance of emotion would force its way in the conversation he anticipated .
just at this time , her father saw somewhat less of her than usual , he was oppressed with business cares . daily , hourly vexations , only twice a week the great water wheel . the delight of our little [male] as it had once been of his father . might be seen slowly turning ; and the water courses along the meadows , with their mechanically forced channels . and their pretty sham cataracts , were almost always low or dry , it ceased to be a pleasure to walk in the green hollow .
then away we go to an island fair that lies in a southern sea . we know not where , and we do not much care . wherever that isle may be , all , when the breezes are a blowing the ship will be going . when they do not we shall all stand still , then away we go to an island fair . we know not where , and we do not much care .
the sound of her voice aroused old [female] . the watchdog , who had been lying in the sun upon the piazza . stretching his huge limbs and shaking his shaggy sides . he stalked into the sitting room . and going up to his [male] laid his head caressingly in her lap .
the fancy free [female] reddened , pouted , tossed back her head , and hardly deigned a farewell word of thanks or civility to the lame man . she was at an age to be affronted by any jokes on such a subject . molly took the joke without disclaimer and without offence . she rather liked the unfounded idea of her having a sweetheart . and was rather surprised to think how devoid of foundation the notion was .
later in the morning i received a surprise of a totally different sort . following the cook 's instructions , i had gone into [male] state room to put it to rights and make the bed . against the wall , near the head of the bunk . was a rack filled with books , i glanced over them . noting with astonishment such names as [male] .
knowing that immediate intelligence of the outburst would be brought to her by himself . she watched from the windows of the great house each morning for a sight of his figure hastening down the glade . a long array of wet days passed their dreary shapes before her . and made the waiting still more tedious , on one of these occasions she ran across to the tower . at the risk of a severe cold , the door was locked .
but what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent ! fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking . this poor peasant of picardy without any other ladder than his self devotion . his good will , and a little of that old rustic cunning , on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise . undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister .
he had begun to learn , in the interval , the lesson most difficult to his direct and trenchant nature . that compromise is the law of married life . on the afternoon of his talk with his wife he had sought her out . determined to make a final effort to clear up the situation between them . but he learned that , immediately after luncheon , she had gone off in the motor with mrs. carbury and two men of the party .
it was a curious fact that , the moment she began to think of [female] . she felt better , it was as if she had lost her way in a wilderness and had met a friend . there was something so capable , so soothing about [male] , and how well he had behaved at that last interview . [female] seemed somehow to be part of her life . she could not imagine a life in which he had no share .
nor was this the only aspect of the situation that pleased nutty , when he had invited bill to the farm he had had a vague hope that good might come of it . but he had never dreamed that things would turn out as well as they promised to do . or that such a warm and immediate friendship would spring up between his sister and the man who had diverted the family fortune into his own pocket . bill and [male] were getting on splendidly , they were together all the time . walking , golfing , attending to the numerous needs of the bees .
they found her in the hall . and it was a hall , here , at dapplemere , wide , and high . and with a minstrel 's gallery at one end . a hall that , years and years ago . had often rung with the clash of men at arms , and echoed with loud .
quinnox smiled and threw up his hands as if unable to combat the quick logic of his companion . together they made their way to the prior 's cell . afterward to the abbot 's apartment , it was barely eleven o'clock and he had not retired . he questioned quinnox closely , bade [male] and blessed him . sent his benediction to the princess and ordered them conducted to the gates .
when she emerged from the dark lanes into the lamplit streets her pace quickened for a moment . then it slackened , and then it quickened again , she walked close to the houses . as if trying to escape observation , where there was a short cut through an ill lighted thoroughfare . she took it , any one following her would have seen that she was familiar with every corner of the town . the oddity and incongruity of her attire attracted attention .
it is my father 's will that i should marry . it is my father 's wish to see me happy . if then you love me as you say . i will marry ; and will be happy -- but only with you. -- i will tell him this. . at first he will start ; then grow angry ; then be in a passion .
he went out then , and was for leaving without his hat or coat . but the [male] caught him at the door . out in the spring sunlight he walked rapidly . still seething , remembering other bitter things he had meant to say , and repeating them to himself . mrs. [organization] 's account of his visit she reported at a meeting specially called .
`` all right , mother , '' cried a voice from behind the partition which separated the rooms . and a moment after the door opened and a young woman about thirty entered . she was better looking than the other sisters , and the fashion of her skirt . and the worldly manner with which she kissed her brother and gave her hand to esther . marked her off at once from the rest of the family .
if [female] 's life had been as the lives of happier women . full of small daily cares and all engrossing domestic interests , the memory of that unearthly scream would no doubt have faded out of her mind ere long . instead of remaining , as it did , a source of constant perplexity to her . but there was no interest , no single charm in her life . there was nothing in the world left for her to care for , the fertile flats around wyncomb farmhouse bounded her universe .
what are his tastes ? shares , has he any principles , shares . what squeezes him into parliament ? shares . perhaps he never of himself achieved success in anything . never originated anything , never produced anything ? sufficient answer to all , shares . o mighty shares , to set those blaring images so high , and to cause [male] smaller vermin . as under the influence of henbane or opium .
the old aunt lived in a cottage near the entrance to the village . she was comfortably off now -- thanks to the two merchant captains . but she had been very poor in the days of their childhood . and had been able to do but little for the neglected lads , she had given them shelter . however , when they had been afraid to go home to their father .
she noticed that there was a second taxi at the door . and while her own driver was `` winding up '' his machine , which took some little time . the other taxi got off in front , she had seen get into it miss wangle . mrs. mosscrop smythe , and mr. [male] . as the taxi sped eastward , [female] began to speculate as to what she really intended doing .
now , all the towers were vacant , except the one defended by nevill , and it had been agreed from the first that he was to stick to his post until time for the last stand . the reason of this was that the door of his tower was screened by the barricade . and the two rear walls of the bordj ( meeting in a triangle at this corner ) . must be defended while the barricade was held , these walls unguarded , the enemy could climb them from outside and fire down on the backs of the europeans . behind the barrier , those who attempted to climb from the courtyard ( the gate stairway being destroyed by the explosion ) .
what a terrible light might have proceeded from the despairing explanations of [organization] . and who knows whether that hideous glare would not have darted forth as far as cosette ? who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel ? the spattering of a lightning flash is of the thunder also , fatality has points of juncture where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the reflections which give color . the purest figures may forever preserve the reflection of a horrible association .
there was a quick intaking of his breath as he hobbled back to his own cot . leaving jan at play with the baby . that night , in the dim , sputtering glow of an oil lamp . [male] and jan thoreau solemnly set to work to thrash out the great problem that had suddenly entered into their existence . to these two there was no element of humor in what they were doing .
she was open , ardent , and not in the least self admiring ; indeed , it was pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister [female] with attractions altogether superior to her own . and if any gentleman appeared to come to the grange from some other motive than that of seeing mr. [male] . she concluded that he must be in love with [male] . sir [male] , for example . whom she constantly considered from [male] 's point of view .
heart from heart is all as far , fafaia , as start from star . i strayed about the deck , an hour , to night under a cloudy moonless sky . and peeped in at the windows , watched my friends at table . in the windows , watched my friends at table . or playing cards , or standing in the doorway , or coming out into the darkness .
their ideas seemed to him fruitful when he was reading or was himself seeking arguments to refute other theories . especially those of the materialists ; but as soon as he began to read or sought for himself a solution of problems . the same thing always happened , as long as he followed the fixed definition of obscure words such as spirit . will , freedom , essence , purposely letting himself go into the snare of words the philosophers set for him . he seemed to comprehend something , but he had only to forget the artificial train of reasoning .
one of the causes of his delay was , that before going to his inn . he had paid a visit to the dinan gate of the town . a place where there were several wine shops , in one of these wine shops . where he was not known , he had bought a bottle of brandy . which he placed in the pocket of his overcoat .
she was a strange figure in the class room . wearing a large , old cloak of greenish cloth , on which was a raised pattern of dull gold . the high collar , and the inside of the cloak . was lined with dark fur , beneath she had a dress of fine lavender coloured cloth . trimmed with fur , and her hat was close fitting , made of fur and of the dull .
but then came the question whether he should have acted in precisely the same way if he had not taken the money ? certainly , if [male] had continued alive and susceptible of further treatment when he arrived . and he had then imagined any disobedience to his orders on the part of [male] . he would have made a strict inquiry , and if his conjecture had been verified he would have thrown up the case . in spite of his recent heavy obligation , but if he had not received any money .
i squeezed myself against the wall and looked down upon the never-ending procession . the street was continually blocked with motor cars and taxicabs . on the other side of the way streams of people were moving all the time . i recognized many acquaintances even in those few minutes , and then suddenly i saw the gray motor car . i held out my hand to mr. [male] , without the slightest attempt at concealment .
and he scowled at my mother , for her comeliness . and yet looked under his eyelids as if he liked her for it . but as for her , in her depth of love grief , it struck scorn upon her womanhood . and in the flash she spoke , what you mean i know not , traitors , cut throats , cowards ! i am here to ask for my husband , she could not say any more .
she pondered over the mystery of uncle [male] disappearance , and found no solution , the thing was inexplicable . she was as sure of the address he had given in his letter as she was of anything in the world . yet at that address nothing had been heard of him . his name was not even known , these were deeper waters than [female] was able to fathom .
when young men approach her with delight , she should think of what she may accomplish through them . the combination of gains and losses on all sides are . gain on one side , and loss on all others . loss on one side and gain on all others . gain on all sides , loss on all sides .
her eyes filled with tears , and through those tears [male] looked large and injured . `` he must be a poet himself to read poetry like that ! '' she said to herself , and felt thoroughly assured that her aunt had wronged him greatly . `` some people scorn poetry like sin , '' she said again , i used myself to think it was only for children .
i know not how it was , but by the indefatigable application of my diligent governess i had no bill preferred against me the first sessions . i mean to the grand jury , at guildhall ; so i had another month or five weeks before me . and without doubt this ought to have been accepted by me , as so much time given me for reflection upon what was past . and preparation for what was to come ; or , in a word , i ought to have esteemed it as a space given me for repentance . and have employed it as such , but it was not in me .
whenever the chat over the tea sank into [male] desultoriness mr. [male] broke in with speeches of labored precision on very remote topics . as if he feared to let [male] 's mind dwell critically on the subject nearest the hearts of all . in truth a constrained manner was natural enough in [male] just now . for the greatest interest of his life was reaching its crisis . could the real have been beheld instead of the corporeal merely , the corner of the room in which he sat would have been filled with a form typical of anxious suspense .
`` food -- bread and milk for baby . '' but when they brought her food herself . she only shrank away and turned her face to the wall without a word . in the hurry the child had been left with robinson and the squire . for some unknown , but most fortunate reason , he took a dislike to robinson 's red face and hoarse voice .
[male] himself , and looked gloomily across the room to where he stood . warming his legs at the blaze , [male] found a difficulty in selecting words . a ticklish business , this , one that might well have disconcerted a diplomat , [male] was no diplomat . and the fact enabled him to find a way in the present crisis . equipped by nature with an amiable tactlessness and a happy gift of blundering .
on the saturday mr. [male] had left before i got down to breakfast . miss [female] kept her room all day . and miss [female] appeared to me to be out of spirits . the house was not what it used to be in the time of mr. and mrs. [female] . i took a walk by myself in the forenoon .
preparations began at once for the eventful transaction in the throne room . the splendor of two courts was to shine in rivalry . ten o'clock was the hour set for the meeting of the two rulers . the [female] and the victim , her nobles and her ladies . her ministers , her guards and her lackeys moved about in the halls .
her knees weakened and as she tried to retreat before his advance she tottered . reaching out her hands with a groping uncertainty , it was then that he caught her in his arms and crushed her close to him . conscious of the wild flutter that went through her soft body . intoxicated by the fragrant softness of the dark hair which he was kissing . and at first oblivious to her struggle for freedom from his embrace .
it was the point blank question she had dreaded . she looked straight at him , and answered : `` no , '' she had burnt her boats . but what did it matter , if she got him ? he would forgive her , and throwing her arms round his neck . she kissed him on the lips .
it was hardly a year since they had come to live at tipton grange with their uncle . a man nearly sixty , of acquiescent temper , miscellaneous opinions . and uncertain vote , he had travelled in his younger years . and was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too rambling habit of mind . mr. [male] 's conclusions were as difficult to predict as the weather .
look at me , consider the trouble i have been in . is it likely that i would wilfully add to my other self reproaches . that of being ungrateful or treacherous to you , i do not understand you , lord , said young [male] , appealing with a gasp to the spikes on the wall . `` he says , what , '' [male] looked at the spikes .
`` then he 's come fra '' halifax , is he ? ', asked [male] . job was in the full glory of host and hostess too . for by a tacit agreement he had roused himself from his habitual abstraction . and had assumed many of [male] 's little household duties , while he moved about he was deep in conversation with the young sailor . trying to extract from him any circumstances connected with the natural history of the different countries he had visited .
and with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where one would have said that he saw some one . it is probable , in fact , that the bishop was present at this death agony . when a being who is dear to [male] is on the point of death . we gaze upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold him back . cosette gave her hand to marius , and both , mute with anguish .
he wondered idly why god had not sent them any children . little ones were so necessary to life , [male] and he would never have drifted apart if the wondering eyes of a child had been there to see . if there had been tiny roseleaf hands to hold them to each other . it would all have been so different then , the blind at one of the windows had become disarranged . and through the aperture [male] saw the first sweet flush of the dawning .
the scaler smiled a thin smile all to himself behind the stove . big [male] radway depended so much on the moral effect of approval or disapproval by those with whom he lived . it amused dyer to withhold the timely word . so leaving the jobber to flounder between his easy nature and his sense of what should be done . dyer knew perfectly well that the work was behind , and he knew the reason .
it was rarely they had the opportunity for so long a conversation as this . and [male] was by no means sorry that it was so . he had very pressing need of all the money his sister could give him . but he did not care to enter into explanations about the state of his affairs . clarissa did not forget the existence of the poor little wife in the rue [female] chevalier bayard .
relieved , as he had that morning been , from the image of guilt which had so long haunted his imagination . he felt his sorrows as a lighter and more tolerable load . but was still unable to take any share in the conversation that passed around him . it was , indeed , of a cast very different from that which he had been accustomed to . the bluntness of oldbuck , the tiresome apologetic harangues of his sister .
towards four o'clock in the morning . [male] , well wrapped up in his cloak , set out for the bertaux . still sleepy from the warmth of his bed , he let himself be lulled by the quiet trot of his horse . when it stopped of its own accord in front of those holes surrounded with thorns that are dug on the margin of furrows . [male] awoke with a start , suddenly remembered the broken leg .
meanwhile , the troll was beating at sir owen with the staff of iron . which , for all its weight and size , he wielded as if it was no more than a stout cudgel . and hard bestead was sir owen to shield himself from the smashing blows which rained upon him . at the seventh blow his shield was cracked across and his shield arm was numbed . suddenly he dashed his horse forward , and the little man .
this scheme was that she should accompany her brother back to portsmouth . and spend a little time with her own family , it had occurred to sir [male] . in one of his dignified musings , as a right and desirable measure . but before he absolutely made up his mind , he consulted his son . [male] considered it every way .
would she see the steward that morning ? no , not that morning , things outside could go on for a while in their course as heretofore . she feared to seem to take possession with pride . and then there was that conviction that it would be well to husband her resources . so she sent for mrs. [female] .
he had made allowances for her , but the ideal girl would have had no need of allowances . the ideal girl would be plucky , cheerfully valiant , a fighter , she would not admit the existence of hard luck . having arrived with a sense of mild astonishment at this conclusion . bill found , also to his surprise , that he had walked ten miles without knowing it and that he was turning in at the farm gate . somebody came down the drive , and he saw that it was [male] .
like a maiden , with skill and sense checking violent impulse . she stayed there for one moment only , just to be admired ; and then like a woman . she came to me , seeing how alarmed i was . the hand she offered me i took . and raised it to my lips with fear .
a howl broke in the middle of the half breed 's throat . where there had been laughter , there came a sudden shutting off of sound , a great gasp . as if made by choking men , swifter than anything they had ever seen in human action carrigan had leaped in . they saw him strike . they heard the blow , they sawpierre 's great head rock back .
is it settled , she asked when her sister had ascended only the first flight of stairs , has he popped ? the look with which the elder sister punished and dismayed the younger . i would not have borne for twenty pounds . she simply looked , and said nothing , but passed on , when she had regained her room she rang the bell . and desired the servant to ask miss [female] to be good enough to step to her .
and so dear mother and [male] lorna now had been for many a day thinking . worrying , and wearing , about the matter between us . neither liked to look at the other , as they used to do ; with mother admiring lorna 's eyes . and [male] , and form of breeding . and lorna loving mother 's goodness , softness , and simplicity .
he had done so , partly at her instance , and with success . but mr. [male] was now somebody in the world . and he was nobody , and he remembered also how on that occasion he had been troubled in his mind in regard to a servant . not as yet knowing whether the usages of the world did or did not require that he should go so accompanied . he had taken the man , and had been thoroughly ashamed of himself for doing so .
the camel corps on the bank yelled to the infantry to come to them . and a hoarse shouting down the river showed that the remainder of the column had wind of the trouble and was hastening to take share in it . as swiftly as a reach of still water is crisped by the wind . the rock strewn ridges and scrub topped hills were troubled and alive with armed men . mercifully , it occurred to these to stand far off for a time , to shout and gesticulate joyously .
on the high ground where the enemy was , the smoke of a cannon rose . and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron . the officers who had been standing together rode off to their places , the hussars began carefully aligning their horses . silence fell on the whole squadron , all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander . awaiting the word of command , a second and a third cannon ball flew past .
they parted , conrade remained standing still upon the spot . and watching the flowing white cloak of the templar as he stalked slowly away . and gradually disappeared amid the fast sinking darkness of the oriental night , proud , ambitious . unscrupulous , and politic , the marquis of montserrat was yet not cruel by nature . he was a voluptuary and an epicurean , and , like many who profess this character .
but [female] , still keeping on the defensive , drew near to [female] 's door . at the noise they made , she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him . he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach . [male] opened the door , [male] , who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point . was not at more than three paces from it , with one spring he flew from the chamber of [male] into that of the maid .
she did her worldliness with grand proper silences . if it might not better be put perhaps that she did her detachment with grand occasional pushes . however susie put it , in truth , she was really . in justice to herself , thinking of the difference , as favourites of fortune . between her old friend and her new , aunt maud sat somehow in the midst of her money .
then the train moved away amid a flutter of handkerchiefs . but still clover and [male] were not left to themselves ; for [male] hope . who had a consultation in [location] , was to see them safely off in the night express . and geoff had some real or invented business which made it necessary for him to go also . clover carried with her through all the three days ride the lingering pressure of geoff 's hand .
a shadow came into jeanne 's eyes . she motioned him to a seat beside her in front of the fire . her nearness , the touch of her dress . the sweet perfume of her presence , thrilled him . he felt that the moment was near when the whole world as he knew it was to slip away from him .
the spaces between these huge rocks were , some of them . fifty feet or more in width , inside the hills the travelers found the ground even rougher than before . and it was nearly half an hour before they emerged on the other side . instead of the shallow valley they expected to find , they came upon a precipice . a sheer drop into a tremendous cañon .
though [female] gow developed the tale as far as his mental and moral reach permitted there were perceptible gaps between his facts . and i had the sense that the deeper meaning of the story was in the gaps . but one phrase stuck in my memory and served as the nucleus about which i grouped my subsequent inferences . `` guess he 's been in starkfield too many winters . '' before my own time there was up i had learned to know what that meant .
in that storm his laugh rang out . a great , free , joyous laugh , he wanted to stop in that instant . sweep her up into his arms , and carry her , he wanted to shout like an insane man in his mad joy . and a moment before she had risked everything in facing three of the bravest men in the service and had shot one of them ! he started to say something , but she increased her speed until she was almost running .
i was out of the door before [male] had left the window . quickly he followed me , however , and on the front porch . where mrs. [female] was already standing , we stood for a half moment . looking up and down the street , the small arc of light made by the corner gaslamp lessened but little the darkness of the seemingly deserted street . and for a while we could distinguish nothing save the shadows cast by the gaunt trees of the square .
next morning he asked me if i was going to the forest of evil fame . and when i replied in the negative , seemed surprised and , very much to my surprise , evidently disappointed . he even tried to persuade me to go , where before i had been earnestly recommended not to go . until , finding that i would not , he took me with him to hunt in the woods . by and by he returned to the same subject : he could not understand why i would not go to that wood .
she drove straight to [female] 's lodging . and , there dismissing the brougham , presented herself , with a great parcel in her arms . for the second time that day , at the door of her room . as unexpected as the first , and even more to the joy of her solitary friend . there folter was in the act of persuading her [female] of the necessity of beginning to dress .
the fact that she would be late in keeping her engagement with [female] was not the only reason which sent katharine almost at racing speed along the strand in the direction of his rooms . punctuality might have been achieved by taking a cab , had she not wished the open air to fan into flame the glow kindled by [male] 's words . for among all the impressions of the evening 's talk one was of the nature of a revelation and subdued the rest to insignificance . thus one looked ; thus one spoke ; such was love , she sat up straight and looked at me . and then she said , `` i am in love , ''
the course that i was myself bound to take . when my formal examination had closed , seemed clear to me , i did not feel called on to volunteer any statement of my own private convictions . in the first place , because my doing so could serve no practical purpose , now that all proof in support of any surmises of mine was burnt with the burnt register . in the second place , because i could not have intelligibly stated my opinion . my unsupported opinion -- without disclosing the whole story of the conspiracy .
he would not ... ah , mother , ... where the river swings so slowly ... ah , no , nevertheless , she was doing all she could for the elderly stranger . and as they came closer , encountered , and passed on , she had the definite impression that he did indeed take her to be a struggling young actress who would some day be famous . and then he might see her on a night of triumph and recognize her as the girl he had passed on the street . that day , so long ago , but by this time , the episode was concluded .
the gate was so familiar , and so like a companion , that they put down [female] 's basket in a corner to serve for a seat . and keeping close together , rested there for some time , while the street was empty and silent . little [female] was not afraid ; but when she heard a footstep at a distance . or saw a moving shadow among the street lamps . she was startled , and whispered , [female] .
dear brother [female] -- your letter lay three days beyond my knowing of it at the post . for i had not money enough by me to pay the carriage . this being a time of great need and sickness here . with the rains that have fallen , as if the windows of heaven were opened again . and to lay by money , from day to day .
he did write his letter , -- in an agony of spirit . `` i sit down , [male] , with a sad heart and a reluctant hand , '' he said , to communicate to you a fatal truth . but truth should be made to prevail , and there is nothing in man so cowardly . so detrimental , and so unmanly as its concealment , i have looked into myself .
then he turned on the lights and moved quickly from room to room of the three comprising his quarters . with comprehensive glances reviewing their condition , but , indeed , he had not left the reception hall for the salon without recognizing that things were in no respect as they ought to be . a hat he had left on the hall rack had been moved to another [male] . a chair had been shifted six inches from its ordained position . and the door of a clothes press , which he had locked on leaving .
i now saw that all the means i took to divert him from his melancholy were fruitless . and that no resource was left but an attempt to combat his passion by the arguments which reason suggested i answered him , yes , there are the mountains where once dwelt your beloved [location] ; and here is the picture you gave her . and which she held , when dying , to her heart -- that heart . which even in its last moments only beat for you , i then presented to [male] the little portrait which he had given to [location] on the borders of the cocoa tree fountain .
when the professor arose , it was an eager . responsive congregation that waited for his word , the people were fully prepared for a sermon that would shake them to their souls ', depths . the younger portion shivered and shrank from the ordeal . the older and more experienced shivered and waited with not unpleasing anticipations ; it did them good . that remorseless examination of their hearts secret depravities .
`` not too much excitement either , '' said the doctor , and with that warning he departed . the parson went with him , [male] had slipped out first . unawares to anybody , grannie carried little katherine to the kitchen . and bathed her before the fire , [female] was propped up with pillows in the armchair in the corner . then [female] brought the ale , and pete welcomed it with a shout .
the cretin being gone , i was free to walk out , at first i lacked courage to venture very far from the rue fossette . but by degrees i sought the city gates . and passed them , and then went wandering away far along chaussees , through fields . beyond cemeteries , catholic and protestant , beyond farmsteads , to lanes and little woods . and i know not where , a goad thrust me on .
mrs. pontellier had brought her sketching materials . which she sometimes dabbled with in an unprofessional way , she liked the dabbling . she felt in it satisfaction of a kind which no other employment afforded her . she had long wished to try herself on madame ratignolle . never had that lady seemed a more tempting subject than at that moment .
and next moment she was planning the camping details . the men , the ponies , with a practical zest that seemed to relegate the occult to the absurd . yet the very next day came a wonderful moment , the sun was just setting and . as it were , suddenly the purple glooms banked up heavy with thunder . the sky was [female] with fury .
he persisted that mrs. [male] had been untrue to him when she left matching without telling him all that she knew of his daughter 's engagement with mr. [male] . no doubt by degrees that idea which he at first entertained was expelled from his head . the idea that she had been cognisant of the whole thing before she came to matching . but even this was done so slowly that there was no moment at which he became aware of any lessened feeling of indignation . to his thinking she had betrayed her trust .
her betrothal was made public , and she proved if not an ardently loving . at least a docile and gentle [male] to [male] . he was content , he could ask no more in reason at the moment . and he was buoyed up by every lover 's confidence that given opportunity and time he could find the way to awaken a response . and it must be confessed that already during their betrothal he gave some proof of his reason for his confidence .
then the two men consulted together , it seemed decided , without a word being spoken on the subject . that both should spend the night with the forlorn couple ; that was settled , but could no doctor be had ? in all probability , no ; the next day an infirmary order must be begged . but meanwhile the only medical advice they could have must be from a druggist 's . so barton set out to find a shop in [location] road .
[male] regarded the empty quay with apathetic eyes . they would come , later on , if he could only get his head down and sleep for a while he would be better able to get toward the front . for he knew now that he was ill , he had . indeed , been ill for days , but he did not realize that , and he hated illness . he regarded it with suspicion .
although he was so far before me , and riding as hard as ride he might . i saw that he had something on the horse in front of him . something which needed care , and stopped him from looking backward . in the whirling of my wits , i fancied first that this was lorna . until the scene i had been through fell across hot brain and heart .
an inaccessible tangle of laurel and rhododendron clothed the rough and precipitous wall of the mountain side . which fell sheer down until lost in purple shadow , with a mantle of green . deep and rich , varied by the gray of the lichen covered rocks , the browns and reds of the bare branches of deciduous trees . and the paler tints of feathery pines . here and there , from damp , springy places , dark hemlocks rose out of the mass .
but sir beaumains had no rest . but wallowed and writhed for the love of the lady of the castle . and so upon the morrow he took his horse and rode until underne . and then he came to a broad water , and thereby was a great lodge . and there he alighted to sleep and laid his head upon the shield .
sir [male] was full of kind attentions . and she felt how lucky she had been to have him by her side in this . her great trouble , gradually the grey coast of [location] began to emerge from the fast gathering evening mists . one or two lights could be seen flickering , and the spires of several churches to rise out of the surrounding haze . the very aspect of the country and its people .
it might come some day perhaps , that affection for which he still dared to hope . but it had not come yet , he watched her face sometimes as she sat by his hearth on those quiet evenings when they were alone . and he knew that a light should have shone upon it that was not there . he would sigh sometimes as he read his newspaper by that domestic hearth . and his wife would wonder if he were troubled by any business cares .
[male] accepted the boon with a look of gratitude . and held it in his hand under the pressure of a little embarrassment . which was not relieved when [female] aunt , elevating her voice into a cry of considerable power . exclaimed , he has a proud stomach , this chap ! he 's too proud a chap to eat it !
was this a sign that her singer had betrayed her . had given her away , as we say nowadays , to posterity ? certain it is that it would have been difficult to put one 's finger on the passage in which her fair fame suffered an imputation . moreover was not any fame fair enough that was so sure of duration and was associated with works immortal through their beauty ? it was a part of my idea that the young lady had had a foreign lover before her meeting with [female] . she had lived with her father and sister in a queer old-fashioned .
sometimes , angry spirits attacked the circumlocution office . sometimes , parliamentary questions were asked about it , and even parliamentary motions made or threatened about it by demagogues so low and ignorant as to hold that the real recipe of government was . how to do it , then would the noble lord , or right honourable gentleman . in whose department it was to defend the circumlocution office . put an orange in his pocket , and make a regular field day of the occasion .
then the matter was discussed in the utmost confidence , and in all its bearings . [female] offered to have a carriage and pair of horses got ready for remiremont . and then to tell the young man that he was expected to get into it . and go away ; but michel felt that there must be some more ceremonious treatment than that . [male] then suggested that the cure should give the message .
she did not need to do a stroke of household work if she preferred to sit in her parlour and sew up a seam ' . indeed [female] resented any interference in the domestic labour . which she had performed so long , that she looked upon the kitchen as a private empire of her own . `` mrs hepburn '' had a good dark silk gown piece in her drawers . as well as the poor dove coloured , against the day when she chose to leave off mourning .
the worst had not yet come , however , for the ship was sound still in her hull . and save that she was now wallowing in the trough of the sea . she was comparatively safe ; she had sprung no leak , but her heavy freight tested her powers fearfully . and the captain was fain to acknowledge that there was nought to be done but abide the raging of the storm until it was over . his attempt to rig a jury mast .
she was conscious of having brought about this situation by a series of actions done as by one in an extravagant dream . of following that idea as to method , which had burst upon her in the hall with glaring obviousness . by gliding to the top of the stairs , assuring herself by listening to the heavy breathing of her maids that they were asleep . gliding down again , turning the handle of the door within which the young girl lay . and deliberately setting herself to do what , if she had anticipated any such undertaking at night and alone .
all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability . or of the essence of life to the laws of reason . the great natural forces lie outside [male] and we are not conscious of them . we call those forces gravitation . inertia , electricity , animal force .
they were standing on the boat deck , leaning over the rail . [female] caught her breath , for the first time since disaster had come upon her she was conscious of a rising of her spirits . it is impossible to behold the huge buildings which fringe the harbour of [location] without a sense of expectancy and excitement . there had remained in [female] 's mind from childhood memories a vague picture of what she now saw . but it had been feeble and inadequate , the sight of this towering city seemed somehow to blot out everything that had gone before .
i had found it a sufficiently difficult job to reduce the king 's style to a peasant 's style . even when he was a willing and anxious pupil ; now then , to undertake to reduce the king 's style to a slave 's style . and by force -- go to , it was a stately contract . never mind the details -- it will save me trouble to let you imagine them . i will only remark that at the end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club and fist had done their work well .
the evidence given by lady [female] and her husband and by mr. [male] was equally favourable . she had always regarded him as a perfect gentleman . lord [male] had found him to be devoted to the service of the country . modest , intelligent , and high spirited , perhaps the few words which fell from mr. [male] were as strong as any that were spoken . he is a man whom i have delighted to call my friend .
at last i was scarcely able to stand on my legs , but even the seasoned old savage was affected by this time . in vino veritas , said the ancients . and the principle holds good where there is no vinum , but only mild casserie . runi now informed me that he had once known a white man . that he was a bad man , which had caused him to say that all white men were bad .
flying spirals of ice climbed up inside the tower . spanning the great stone well with spidery bridges . joining icy galleries , in some of those galleries . stark vaguely glimpsed rigid , gleaming figures like statues of ice . but he could not see them clearly as he was carried on .
with that , we arrived in sight of the boat . once more , necklaces and scarabs and baskets were thrust under our noses . [male] had returned from his mysterious whisperings in cafes or mosques in the new town . and was waiting for us , [male] called him . with a note of gayety in her voice .
no ghost 's looks mattered much , however , for good or ill , once the slowly moving enchantress had swept aside a purple curtain of distance and shown [male] such a stagesetting as only nature 's stupendous theatre can give . it was a stage still dimly , but most effectively revealed : lights down . pale blue , lilac and cold green . a thrilling , almost sinister combination : no gold or rose switched on yet . turned obliquely toward the river , facing slightly northward , four figures sat on thrones .
it took the two adventurers over an hour to get safely up the hill and into the palace . its main entrance , approached by a long flight of steps . was an impossible means of ingress , but aura fortunately knew of a smaller door at the side which led into the basement of the building . this door they found slightly ajar , it was open so little . however , that they could not get past , and as they were not strong enough even with their combined efforts .
anselmo received this letter , and from it he gathered that lothario had already begun his task and that [male] must have replied to him as he would have wished . and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence he sent word to her not to leave his house on any account . as he would very shortly return , [female] was astonished at [female] 's reply . which placed her in greater perplexity than before , for she neither dared to remain in her own house . nor yet to go to her parents ' ; for in remaining her virtue was imperilled .
it was a view of extraordinary solemnity that he looked on . as he stood leaning against the rough door post , the night was still stronger than day . overhead was as [male] as ever , and stars shone in it through the dissolving clouds that were passing at last . but , immediately over the grim , serrated edge of the crag that faced him to the east . a faint and tender light was beginning to burn .
i -- i did not love the man i was engaged to , ', she said . she met his eyes for a moment . and could not interpret their expression , they struck her as cold and indifferent . her heart failed her and her resolution became water . she remained standing stiffly , unable even to move , she could not look at him through an interval that seemed to her a vast gulf of time .
costanza of course had finally to go because she had to cook . but hardly had she gone before domenico came , he came to water and tie up . that was natural , since he was the gardener , but he watered and tied up all the things that were nearest to her . he hovered closer and closer ; he watered to excess ; he tied plants that were as straight and steady as arrows . well , at least he was a man , and therefore not quite so annoying .
whispered `` poison , '' never again did the princess drive out to see the women she knew . and those who had been her friends were sent away from the door of the dead [male] 's palace . over which he had suspended for `` luck , '' a huge crocodile killed in the far south . but [female] was beautiful , with strange eyes which drew love whether she asked for it or not . and sometimes a small lattice would open in a bay of one of those windows of wooden lace whose carving was known as mushrbiyeh work because shirib .
on this subject it was quite impossible that [male] should say anything . [male] was standing by him , and she . as he knew , was engaged to captain [male] , so circumstanced , what could he say as to [male] 's settlement in life ? that something should be said between him and the old man . and something also between him and [male] .
he consulted his watch , he judged that a quarter after nine . or perhaps nine thirty , would be about the psychological time for his entry upon the scene . with his contribution of an unforeseen climax to the drama . it was not yet seven , and it would be as well to wait here while the storm . which made the old ice house tremble about his head .
they had not made a hurried march from the desert city . for [male] and sabine had calculated the hour at which nevill might have received the summons . and the time he would take on the return journey . it was possible , lady macgregor being what she was . that she might have rewired the telegram to a certain bordj .
why , i have seen drops myself ordered by doctor [male] . as is our club doctor and a good charikter . and has brought more live children into the world nor ever another i middlemarch -- i say i have seen drops myself as made no difference whether they was in the glass or out . and yet have griped you the next day , so i will leave your own sense to judge .
soon afterwards , as [female] did not return , i took leave of her . and went to our own parlour , he was not there , he had left word with little [male] . who met him on the common , that he was gone a long walk . and should not return till dinner time , dinner time came , but i had to dine alone . it was the first time i ever knew him break even such a trivial promise .
these beings also lived with shorn heads , with downcast eyes . with lowered voices , not in disgrace , but amid the scoffs of the world . not with their backs bruised with the cudgel , but with their shoulders lacerated with their discipline . their names , also , had vanished from among men ; they no longer existed except under austere appellations . they never ate meat and they never drank wine .
after his illness birkin went to the south of [location] for a time . he did not write , nobody heard anything of him . ursula , left alone , felt as if everything were lapsing out , there seemed to be no hope in the world . one was a tiny little rock with the tide of nothingness rising higher and higher she herself was real . and only herself -- just like a rock in a wash of flood water .
sometimes mr kissing would lay the matter before the board , and then he . and mr love , and two or three delinquent clerks would be summoned thither . it seldom led to much , the delinquent clerks would be cautioned . one commissioner would say a word in private to mr love , and another a word in private to mr kissing . then , when left alone , the commissioners would have their little jokes , saying that kissing .
mr. [male] went away with some show of briskness . but dropped into a very leisurely pace as soon as he was fairly out of his master 's sight . he went straight to the stables , where he had a [male] gossip with the grooms and hangers on . and amused himself further by inspecting every bit of horseflesh in the [male] stables . prior to selecting a quiet grey cob which he felt himself capable of driving .
every desired renewal of an existence is debased by being half alloy . if at the estrangement or death of my lost love . i could go and see her child -- hers solely . there would be comfort in it , said jude . and then he again uneasily saw , as he had latterly seen with more and more frequency .
in varenka she realized that one has but to forget oneself and love others . and one will be calm , happy , and noble , and that was what [female] longed to be . seeing now clearly what was the most important , [female] was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it . she at once gave herself up with her whole soul to the new life that was opening to her . from varenka 's accounts of the doings of madame stahl and other people whom she mentioned .
the door opened , and some english ladies entered , faintly acknowledging , provisionally ignoring . his presence , and talking of what they had been doing since lunch . they agreed that it was really too cold in the churches for any pleasure in the pictures . and that the pitti gallery , where they had those braziers . was the only place you could go with comfort .
he did not knock , but taking from his pocket a key . he opened and entered at once , ushering me in , he shut the door behind us . no servant appeared , the vestibule was small , like the house . but freshly and tastefully painted ; its vista closed in a french window with vines trained about the panes . tendrils , and green leaves kissing the glass .
i have no doubt he thoroughly deserved all he got , [male] . we are infinitely obliged to your majesty -- -- pitti . much obliged , your majesty , pooh . very much obliged , your majesty , [male] , obliged ? not a bit . do not mention it , how could you tell ? pooh . no . of course we could not tell who the gentleman really was , pitti .
the fragment of a lobster shell which had entered mr. [male] 's tongue at twenty minutes to two in the afternoon was still in occupation at half past eleven that night . when that persecuted gentleman blew out his candle and endeavoured to compose himself for a night 's slumber . its unconscious host had not yet been made aware of its presence , he had a vague feeling that the tip of his tongue felt a little sore . but his mind was too engrossed with the task of keeping a look out for the preliminary symptoms of mumps to have leisure to bestow much attention on this phenomenon . the discomfort it caused was not sufficient to keep him awake .
i spoke of the boy ; he is a fine lad . somewhat haughty , perhaps ; a little spoiled by the country people calling him the young lord . but a generous fellow , and very like glencore when he first joined [male] at canterbury . by way of educating him himself . glencore has been driving virgil and decimal fractions into him .
in the meantime , all the beggars , all the lackeys . all the cutpurses , joined with the scholars , had gone in procession to seek . in the cupboard of the law clerks company , the cardboard tiara . and the derisive robe of the pope of the fools .
to this there is nothing to say , peoples , like planets . possess the right to an eclipse , and all is well , provided that the light returns and that the eclipse does not degenerate into night . dawn and resurrection are synonymous , the reappearance of the light is identical with the persistence of the i . let [male] state these facts calmly . death on the barricade or the tomb in exile .
he was already on board heavily ironed , when the dey at length agreed to reduce his demand by one half . and father [male] by borrowing was able to make up the amount , and on september 19 . 1580 , after a captivity of five years all but a week . [male] was at last set free , before long he discovered that blanco [male] paz . who claimed to be an officer of the inquisition , was now concocting on false evidence a charge of misconduct to be brought against him on his return to [male] .
taking her lonely place in the cabin , after the conversation just referred to . she again hid her face in her hands . and remained with her head bowed in her lap for a long . long while , half dreaming , half waking . poor , untutored , uncivilized child of nature , she was very .
as if to show very decidedly that he did intend to cut me , i met him one day . not in the street , but in the house , on the stairs . he sprung up the steps , two at a time . came to a momentary pause on the landing , and looked at me . no look of surprise , none of recognition .
then , as she stoops to pluck the noxious weed from off the sod . a tear will fall , and consecrate the spot to charity . for ever honoured be the sacred drop of humanity ; the angel of mercy shall record its source . and the soul from whence it sprang shall be immortal . my dear madam , contract not your brow into a frown of disapprobation .
there was yet another reason why the son of heaven inclined to the little shiobara . it had reached the emperor that a recluse of the utmost sanctity dwelt in that forest . his name was semimaru , he had made himself a small hut in the deep woods . much as a decrepit silkworm might spin his last cocoon and there had the [male] found him . it had also reached his majesty that , although blind .
by that the enchantment was past , and when she came she saluted him . and asked him what cheer , i can not say . fair damosel , said sir [male] , for i wot not how i came into this castle but it be by an enchantment . sir , said she , ye must make good cheer . and if ye be such a knight as it is said ye be , i shall tell you more to morn by prime of the day .
catherine inquired no further ; she had heard enough to feel that mrs. [female] had no real intelligence to give . and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister . could she have foreseen such a circumstance . nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others . and , as it was , she could only lament her ill luck .
as to his shirt collar , and his coat collar , they were perplexing to reflect upon . insoluble mysteries both , why should a man scrape himself to that extent . before he could consider himself full dressed ? why should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his holiday clothes ? then he fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation . with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth .
it is to suffer , to hate , yes , to hate even the object of your love . when that love is hopeless ; to hate him for the very attributes that have made you love him . to grudge the gifts and graces that have made him dear . it is to hate every creature on whom his eyes look with greater tenderness than they look on you . to watch one face until its familiar lines become a perpetual torment to you .
may knowledge come to us , what is this secret our heart has understood and yet will not reveal to us . although it seems to beat as if it were endeavoring to tell it ? my hands ... my spirit ... my sky ... my forest ... this earth of mine ... what must i say besides ? these are the words . this is the answer , i stand here on the summit of the mountain .
it might reasonably have been supposed that she was listening to the wind . which rose somewhat as the night advanced , and laid hold of the attention . the wind , indeed , seemed made for the scene , as the scene seemed made for the hour . part of its tone was quite special ; what was heard there could be heard nowhere else . gusts in innumerable series followed each other from the northwest .
veneering having instructed his driver to charge at the public in the streets . like the life guards at waterloo , is driven furiously to duke street . saint [male] 's , there , he finds [male] in his lodgings . fresh from the hands of a secret artist who has been doing something to his hair with yolks of eggs . the process requiring that [male] shall , for two hours after the application .
there was a room always kept ready for him on the same floor . at the further end of a short thickly carpeted passage . how she passed the night , this woman with no illusions to help her through the hours which must have been sleepless i should not like to say . it ended at last ; and this strange victim of the [female] barral failure . whose name would never be known to the official receiver , came down to breakfast .
mr. [male] , who was just starting back to the burr house . paused in the doorway , all eyes were fixed upon his son . `` try her , matt , show [female] what you can do , '' called the men in chorus , but the young man shook his head . and found something that needed his immediate attention , all that morning at intervals the mountaineers urged the big fellow to attempt the feat .
here also i am not able to answer , but must leave the reader to form his own judgment on the facts before him . as detailed by mr. [male] in the following pages , it was in this very month something over twenty years ago that i . ludwig [male] , was sitting one night in my rooms at cambridge . grinding away at some mathematical work , i forget what , i was to go up for my fellowship within a week . and was expected by my tutor and my college generally to distinguish myself .
he had gone through much in the day that was past , he had loved and lost . he had striven to recapture , and had failed , in a strange resolve he had found serenity and joy . he had been at the point of death . and had been saved , he had seen that his beloved was worthless , and he had not cared . he had fought for her , and conquered ; and had pled with her , and -- all these memories were loathsome by reason of that final thing which had all the while lain in wait for him .
in [female] home there were sad , troubled faces and anxious hearts . as the husband and daughter watched by the wife and mother . whose life on earth was well nigh ended , from her mother 's family mrs. [female] had inherited the seeds of consumption . which had fastened upon her , day by day . they watched her , and when at last she left them it seemed so much like falling away to sleep that mr. [male] .
this ball was an exceptional affair , given some time before shrovetide . in honor of the anniversary of the birth of a famous draftsman . and it was expected to be much gayer , noisier , more bohemian than the ordinary masked ball . numbers of artists had arranged to go , accompanied by a whole cohort of models and pupils . who , by midnight , began to create a tremendous din , [male] climbed the grand staircase at five minutes to twelve .
the rain has stopped ; and the persons on the outside of the crowd begin to drop off , the bystander . that ai not a police whistle : that 's a sporting whistle . the note taker , i do not know whether you have noticed it . but the rain stopped about two minutes ago , all the rest have gone except the note taker . the gentleman , and the flower girl .
amory : i am afraid i can not if you love me . you are afraid of taking two years knocks with me . amory : i can not give you up ! i can not , that 's all , i have got to have you ! [female] : you are being a baby now .
with the dying man 's hand in his hand . he sat for half an hour , an hour , another hour . he did not think of death at all now , he wondered what [male] was doing . who lived in the next room ; whether the doctor lived in a house of his own . he longed for food and for sleep .
[male] lightly crossed the terrace at [male] 's hotel and traversed the length of the hall to the office at its back where mail is distributed . for him there was a great budget and he carried it out to one of the tables on the awninged terrace which overlooks the street . yes , here was the publisher 's note , he tore the envelope . you have become famous , began his enthusiastic sponsor , the thing has been a knockout . the presses are groaning , he read that letter and turned to others .
they passed lightly on , for their steps ran in whispering echoes through the gallery . and often did [female] cast a fearful glance around , the gallery terminated in a large old stair case . which led to a hall below ; on the left appeared several doors which seemed to lead to separate apartments . while they hesitated which course to pursue , a light flashed faintly up the stair case . and in a moment after passed away ; at the same time was heard the sound of a distant footstep .
for in spite of the acknowledged importance of her riding on horse-back . no measures were taken for mounting her again , `` because , '' as it was observed by her aunts . `` she might ride one of her [female] 's horses at any time when they did not want them , '' and as the miss bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day . and had no idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real pleasure .
in fact , with incredible rapidity and marvelous lucidity . [male] deciphered the largest papers and most complicated writings . correcting them , annotating them with a pen moved as if by a fever . and the work melting under his hands , signatures , figures . references , became multiplied as if ten clerks -- that is to say , a hundred fingers and ten brains had performed the duties .
the hazel tree did not belie its name today . the whole of the copse wood where the mist had cleared returned purest tints of that hue . amid which [male] himself was in the act of making a hurdle . the stakes being driven firmly into the ground in a row . over which he bent and wove the twigs , beside him was a square .
but capt , barold was not as favorably impressed by these remarks as might have been anticipated . `` what an old fool she is , '' was his polite inward comment . and he resolved at once to make his visit as brief as possible , and not to be induced to run down again during his stay at broadoaks . he did not even take the trouble to appear to enjoy his evening , from his earliest infancy . he had always found it easier to please himself than to please other people .
as soon as he felt the ground , emma 's horse set off at a [organization] . [female] galloped by her side , now and then they exchanged a word . her figure slightly bent , her hand well up , and her right arm stretched out . she gave herself up to the cadence of the movement that rocked her in her saddle . at the bottom of the hill [male] gave his horse its head .
these emotions , which she laboured to subdue , passed , however , the bounds of her ineffectual resistance . when at the time of retiring after dinner , he said to her in a low voice . but such as it was meant the company should hear , do me the favour . miss milner , to call at my study some time in the evening . i have to speak with you upon business .
frightened , miserable , she was counting her chances when a man . whose coming into the room her dilemma had caused her to miss , marched unhesitatingly to her table . [female] glanced up , her face aflame . like a fanned coal , the man was tall , dark , lean , square jawed , handsome in just that thrilling way which magazine illustrators and women love . the ideal story hero to look at , even to the clothes which any female serial writer would certainly have described as `` immaculate evening dress . ''
[male] flung open the door wrathfully , that [male] hignett should still be alive was bad . he had pictured him hurling himself overboard and bobbing about . a pleasing sight in the wake of the vessel . that he should be singing was an outrage , remorse , [male] felt . should have stricken [male] hignett dumb .
in all his encounters with his son , the count was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family fortune . and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless sonya . on this occasion , he was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not been in disorder . no better wife for [male] than sonya could have been wished for . and that no one but himself with his mitenka and his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family finances .
on reaching it the chariots were parked with military precision on the four sides of the enclosure . and half a score of warriors , headed by the enormous chieftain . and including tars tarkas and several other lesser chiefs , dismounted and advanced toward it . i could see tars tarkas explaining something to the principal chieftain . whose name , by the way , was , as nearly as i can translate it into english .
in a little while they had brought sir [male] to the hermitage . where the hermit took out the head of the spear and bound up the wound and gave to the knight a strong cordial . anon he was refreshed and came to his senses again . next day the court journeyed towards [location] . and rested for the night at astolat ; and the town being full .
a man , no doubt , may live at pau on driblets . may pay his way and drink his bottle of cheap wine . and enjoy life after a fashion while reading galignani and looking at the mountains . but , -- as it seemed to the archdeacon , -- when there was a choice between this kind of thing . and fox covers at plumstead , and a seat among the magistrates of barsetshire .
a sob , like a bird new born , burst from [male] 's bosom . it broke the enchantment in which [male] was bound . that enchantment had possessed him , usurping as it were the throne of his life . and displacing it ; when it ceased , he was not his own master . he started -- to conscious confusion only , neither knowing where he was nor what he did .
saint durande is a saint of l'angoumois . and of the charente ; whether she is an orthodox member of the calendar is a question for the bollandists . orthodox or not , she has been made the patron saint of numerous chapels . it was while lethierry was a young sailor at [male] that he had made the acquaintance of this saint . probably in the person of some pretty charantaise , perhaps in that of the grisette with the white nails .
in the great white desolation , distance was a mocking vision . hills looked nigh , and valleys far ; when hills were far and valleys nigh . and the misty breath of frost , piercing through the ribs of rock . striking to the pith of trees , creeping to the heart of man . lay along the hollow places , like a serpent sloughing .
there are few writers of note , of any country . or of any age , from whom quotations might not be made in proof of the love with which they regarded nature . and this remark applies as much to religious and philosophic writers as to poets . equally to [male] ,francois [male] sales . bacon , and fenelon , as to [male] .
so , wasting no time in farewells , i set out . by ten o'clock i was at hofbau . for i rode furiously , from there i sent to bernenstein at the palace word of my coming . but there i was delayed , there was no train for an hour . at last i was in the train ; now indeed we moved .
[female] turned her face up stream to listen , a dozen times she had done this during the last half hour . and [female] had listened with her , at first they had heard a distant murmur . rising as they advanced , like an autumn wind that grows stronger each moment in the tree tops . the murmur was steady now , without the variations of a wind . it was the distant roaring of the rocks and rushing floods of big thunder rapids .
already a few who had arrived were playing marbles on the stones of the cemetery . others , astride the wall , swung their legs . kicking with their clogs the large nettles growing between the little enclosure and the newest graves . this was the only green spot , all the rest was but stones . always covered with a fine powder , despite the vestry broom , the children in list shoes ran about there as if it were an enclosure made for them .
he kissed , not her cheek or mouth . but her little child hands , reverently , as if she had been the saint he worshipped . or , perhaps , the woman whom afterwards he would learn to adore , then he went away . `` truly , '' said the mother , in an amused aside to me . as with a kind of motherly pride she watched him walk hastily down between those chestnut trees .
it was the fifteenth of january . about nine o'clock in the morning : bessie was gone down to breakfast . my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama ; eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden coat to go and feed her poultry . an occupation of which she was fond . and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained .
mrs. [female] , called upon next , spoke after some little delay . caused by the loss of her pocket handkerchief , would not presume to differ in opinion with her husband . whom she had never yet known to be otherwise than perfectly right about everything , but , if the german surgeon did come . and if mr. [male] saw no objection to it . she would much like to consult him on the subject of `` baby 's eyes . ''
either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light . or the sense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes upon her . sent up her spirits wonderfully , her hopes mingled with the [female] in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her as she bounded along against the soft south wind . she heard a [female] voice in every breeze . and in every bird 's note seemed to lurk a joy .
every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been great men , ', says history . and , indeed , human reason replies : every time conquerors appear there have been wars . but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single man . whenever i look at my watch and its hands point to ten . i hear the bells of the neighboring church ; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten .
in the darkness of that long night 's work no man knew his neighbor . men from the river , men from the mill . men from the yard all worked side by side . thus no one noticed especially a tall , slender , but well knit individual dressed in a faded mackinaw and a limp slouch hat which he wore pulled over his eyes . this young fellow occupied himself with the chains .
baron , neither -- but for me , she was always virtuous and good , [female] . did it cost you trouble and earnest entreaty to make her otherwise , [female] . the witness you called at that time was the being who sees you now . what you gave in pledge was your honour . which you must redeem , therefore thank heaven that it is in your power to redeem it .
sir [male] had not noticed that any one was so close to him . he walked on without looking round , [organization] turned very quietly to one side in order to pass him . but at that moment [organization] saw behind the scottish gallant something that looked like another shadow . he saw something long and thin and gray , which floated over the white surface without leaving footprints in the snow or making it crunch . [organization] saw plainly that behind sir [male] stole a young maid in a long gray garment .
it was a long walk through the heavy sand to the foot of the hill . when they arrived they found themselves at the beginning of a broad stone roadway . only a path to those of normal oroid size -- that wound back and forth up the hill to the palace . they walked up this road , and as they progressed . saw that it was laid through a grassy lawn that covered the entire hillside .
we were interrupted at this juncture by the approach of one of the warriors . bearing arms , accouterments and ornaments . and in a flash one of her questions was answered and a puzzle cleared up for me . i saw that the body of my dead antagonist had been stripped , and i read in the menacing yet respectful attitude of the warrior who had brought me these trophies of the kill the same demeanor as that evinced by the other who had brought me my original equipment . and now for the first time i realized that my blow .
ah , but you will cry out , `` what a chatterbox ! '' all the people round me say , on the contrary , `` mademoiselle is very taciturn . '' the foregoing letters seemed very original to the persons from whom the author of the comedy of human life ', obtained them . but their interest in this duel , this crossing of pens between two minds . may not be shared , for every hundred readers , eighty might weary of the battle .
soon after this the noise of timbrels was heard , at the sound of which the whole saracen cavaliers threw themselves from their horses . and prostrated themselves , as if for a second morning prayer . this was to give an opportunity to the queen , with [female] and her attendants . to pass from the pavilion to the gallery intended for them . fifty guards of saladin 's seraglio escorted them with naked sabres .
the choir stamped severally on the door stone to shake from their boots any fragment of earth or leaf adhering thereto . then entered the house and looked around to survey the condition of things . through the open doorway of a small inner room on the right hand . of a character between pantry and cellar . was [male] dewy 's father reuben .
this is a gentle delineation , is it not , reader ? yet he whom it describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle . a yielding , an impressible , or even of a placid nature , quiescent as he now sat . there was something about his nostril , his mouth . his brow , which , to my perceptions , indicated elements within either restless . or hard , or eager , he did not speak to me one word .
sancho fetched him his clothes . and while he was dressing , the curate gave [male] and the others present an account of [male] 's madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from that pena pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his lady 's scorn . he described to them also nearly all the adventures that [male] had mentioned . at which they marvelled and laughed not a little , thinking it , as all did . the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could be capable of .
[female] wakened on the morning of her wedding day to find the [female] winking in at the window of the little porch gable and a september breeze frolicking with her curtains . she recalled the first morning she had wakened in that little porch room . when the [female] had crept in on her through the blossom drift of the old snow queen . that had not been a happy wakening , for it brought with it the bitter disappointment of the preceding night . but since then the little room had been endeared and consecrated by years of happy childhood dreams and maiden visions .
on the day following , lady [female] was again in park lane . when she first read madame goesler 's letter . she felt herself to be annoyed and angry , but her anger was with herself rather than with her correspondent . ever since her last interview with the woman whom she had feared . she had been conscious of having been indiscreet , all her feelings had been too violent .
holding his knife between his teeth , [male] descended . by the help of feet and hands . from the upper part of the escarpment , and leaped into the water . it reached almost to his shoulders , he made his way through the porch . and found himself in a blind passage , with a roof in the form of a rude arch over his head .
others had made the same attempt , and there was a household of blenkers . an intense and voluble mother , and three blowsy daughters who imitated her . where one met [female] and patti and [female] . and the new shakespearian actor [female] , and some of the magazine editors and musical and literary critics . mrs. [female] and her group felt a certain timidity concerning these persons .
but i encouraged [female] at the time , i was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes . and could not retrace the by paths we had trodden together , i begged [male] to be comforted . for we had ever been the best of friends , and we ever would be so . [male] scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist . as if he were bent on gouging himself , but said not another word .
`` you are a stupid , scurvy innkeeper , '' said [male] . and putting spurs to [male] and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of the inn before anyone could stop him . and pushed on some distance without looking to see if his squire was following him . the ill luck of the unfortunate [male] so ordered it that among the company in the inn there were four woolcarders from [location] . three needle makers from the colt of cordova .
i promised , when the business which took me to england was settled . to return again to marseilles , and to travel back with him to his home in [location] . as soon as he was fit to be moved , on this condition , i gained permission to go . poor as i was , i infinitely preferred charging my slender purse with the expense of the double journey . to remaining any longer in ignorance of what was going on at ramsgate -- or at dimchurch .
when i reached home i began to cry like a child . there is no man to whom a woman has not been unfaithful , once at least . and who will not know what i suffered , i said to myself . under the weight of these feverish resolutions which one always feels as if one had the force to carry out . that i must break with my amour at once , and i waited impatiently for daylight in order to set out forthwith to rejoin my father and my sister .
the little casement window in [female] 's bed chamber was almost filled up with rose and vine branches . but pushing them aside , and stretching a little out , she could see the tops of the parsonage chimneys above the trees . and distinguish many a well-known line through the leaves , mr. [organization] had strawberries and cream . a loaf of brown bread , and a jug of milk . ( together with a stilton cheese and a bottle of port for his own private refreshment .
on the appointed day king mark and iseult . and the barons of cornwall , stood by the river . and the knights of [male] and all their host were arrayed beyond . and just before them , sitting on the shore , was a poor pilgrim . wrapped in cloak and hood , who held his wooden platter and begged alms .
but the cloud never comes in that quarter of the horizon from which we watch for it . there had been slight complaints and passing regrets on her mother 's part . over some trifle connected with [female] , and her father 's position there . when [female] had been spending her holidays at home before . but in the general happiness of the recollection of those times .
then all those knights sought the house thereas the armour was . and then they armed them , and every knight found his own horse . and all that ever longed unto him , and when this was done , there came a forester with four horses laden with fat venison . [male] , sir [male] said . here is good meat for [male] for one meal .
he had stayed a long time at the chemist 's . although he had not seemed much moved , [male] , nevertheless , had exerted himself to buoy him up . to `` keep up his spirits , '' then they had talked of the various dangers that threaten childhood . of the carelessness of servants , madame [female] knew something of it . having still upon her chest the marks left by a basin full of soup that a cook had formerly dropped on her pinafore .
the journey was made first to [male] , and then to [location] . once , as they were making their way through the kentish hop fields . he put out his hand feebly , and touched hers . they had the carriage to themselves . and she was down on her knees before him instantly .
she had never seen him since a day on which she had parted from him with many kisses . with warm , pressing , eager kisses , -- of which she had been nowhat ashamed . he had then been to her almost as her husband , she had trusted him entirely . and had thrown herself into his arms with a full reliance . there is often much of reticence on the part of a woman towards a man to whom she is engaged .
but [female] was not at the hotel [male] grand charlemagne . he had received a message from the prince . to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it . the night was dark , but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege . [male] and [male] did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades .
i let it go at that , then i read in a low voice , to as many as could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance . part of the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well . and was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through : `` ah h h , '' `` how true ! '' amazing , amazing , these be the very haps as they happened . in marvelous exactness , and might they take this strange thing in their hands .
when [female] came downstairs again , the island , as well as all [location] . was in the throes of a campaign preceding a general election . [male] , who was an ardent conservative , found himself caught in the vortex . being much in demand for speech making at the various county rallies . [male] did not approve of his mixing up in politics and told [male] so .
he was a man about fifty years of age . who had a preoccupied air , and who was good , that was all that could be said about him . father madeleine gave employment to every one . he exacted but one thing : be an honest man . be an honest woman , the hospital was badly endowed ; he founded six beds there .
what however went first of all or rather vanished was nothing in the nature of an asset . it was that plotting governess with the trick of a `` perfect lady '' manner and the soul of a remorseless brigand . when a woman takes to any sort of unlawful man trade . there 's nothing to beat her in the way of thoroughness .
imagine her -- it is always good to imagine a human creature in whom bodily loveliness seems as properly one with the entire being as the bodily loveliness of those wondrous transparent orbs of life that we find in the sea . imagine her with her dark hair brushed from her temples , but yet showing certain tiny rings there which had cunningly found their own way back . the mass of it hanging behind just to the nape of the little neck in curly fibres . such as renew themselves at their own will after being bathed into straightness like that of water grasses . then see the perfect cameo her profile makes , cut in a duskish shell .
still , without reason , as we stood there by the hedge . we felt our lips drawn tight with hatred , a sudden hatred for all our brother men . and the golden one saw it and smiled slowly , and there was in their smile the first sadness we had seen in them . we think that in the wisdom of women the golden one had understood more than we can understand . then three of the sisters in the field appeared , coming toward the road .
she was expecting a visit of her old school fellow , little [female] . with all the [female] mischief at her command . she had tendered her request for suzanne 's company to the comtesse in the presence of the prince of wales last night . his royal highness had loudly applauded the notion . and declared that he would give himself the pleasure of calling on the two ladies in the course of the afternoon .
he went back into the cabin and stood where [male] had stood . at the window , nepapinas had not taken away the basins of water . and the bandages were still there , and the pile of medicated cotton . and the suspiciously made-up bed , after all , he was losing something by not occupying the bed . and yet ifpierre or bateese had messed him up badly , and a couple of fellows had lugged him in between them .
thus was the galeasse plunged into a darkness that for some moments was [female] and impenetrable as velvet . then slowly , as the eyes became accustomed to it , this gloom was gradually relieved . once more men and objects began to take shape in the faint . steely radiance of the summer night . [male] stood at the head of the companion .
we stood in a third cavern , some fifty feet in length by perhaps as great a height . and thirty wide , it was carpeted with fine white sand , and its walls had been worn smooth by the action of i know not what . the cavern was not dark like the others , it was filled with a soft glow of rose coloured light . more beautiful to look on than anything that can be conceived , but at first we saw no flashes . and heard no more of the thunderous sound , presently , however , as we stood in amaze .
had he done as he intended , and as he knew he ought . by going down to everingham after his return from portsmouth , he might have been deciding his own happy destiny . but he was pressed to stay for mrs. [female] 's party . his staying was made of flattering consequence , and he was to meet mrs. [female] there . curiosity and vanity were both engaged , and the temptation of immediate pleasure was too strong for a mind unused to make any sacrifice to right .
saving your presence , dearest , i would rather have prince otto . a very lovable character for second affections to cling to , [male] feverel would never marry again . so i do not ask for him : as for the rest , they are all too excellent for me . they give me the impression of having worn copy books under their coats . when they were boys , to cheat punishment .
there is no doubt that she suffered , of course she still told her heart wonderful tales about the shame that she had to bear and her torturing wrongs . and beyond doubt she believed most of them . for she could still profess to herself a miserable degradation in being married to a man of no name . she would be gloomily convinced that [male] was by his father 's villainy a proven knave . but what hurt her most was the growing suspicion that she was much to blame for her own plight .
but i must claim the privilege of conducting my own practice according to my own views . in this court i am subject to the bench . in my own chamber i am subject only to the law of the land . the judge looking over his spectacles said a mild word about the profession at large . mr. [male] , twisting his wig quite on one side .
they were ready , and [female] was about to give the word to start when there was an interruption . out of the forest and into their midst came a figure . the form of a man who rose above them like a giant . and whose voice as it bellowed [male] 's name had in it the wrath of thunder . for a moment [male] adare stood like an avenging demon in the midst of the startled faces of the forest men .
he smiled at her and obeyed ; for he knew that she could not escape from him . therefore he would humour her a little , in a few more moments he meant to have her in his arms again . victoria 's eyes followed his pointing gesture . the sand crystals sparkled in the sunset and moonrise . like myriads of earthbound fireflies .
my appearance , with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders . favored my object , although i had sent mr. [male] a brief account of the accident as soon as i had arrived in town . yet i had to give him all the details now ; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard . and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence , than it had been before . while i described the disaster , mr. [male] stood .
gudrun hated the cafe , yet she always went back to it . as did most of the artists of her acquaintance , she loathed its atmosphere of petty vice and petty jealousy and petty art . yet she always called in again , when she was in town . it was as if she had to return to this small , slow , central whirlpool of disintegration and dissolution . just give it a look , she sat with [female] drinking some sweetish liqueur .
we were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate wopsle had gone too far , and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time . the strange gentleman , with an air of authority not to be disputed . and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of [male] that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it . left the back of the settle , and came into the space between the two settles . in front of the fire , where he remained standing .
when various sums were mentioned in reference to such an affair . safety could alone be found in taking the outside sum ; -- perhaps might generally be more surely found by adding fifty per cent , to that . he knew that he was wrong about the election . but he assured himself that he had had no alternative . the misfortune had been that the duke should have made his proclamation about the borough immediately after the offer made by the duchess .
day had taken from my dream nothing of its vividness . but my nerves were normal again , and i could approach the task with a coolness which had not been possible the night before . that [female] had taken refuge with the kingdons . i did not for an instant doubt ; it was my business to prove it . to gain entrance to her presence and persuade her to grant [female] a final interview .
in the course of the morning he lay in wait very patiently near a spot overflowed by the river . where , the day before , he had noticed lily-pads growing . after a time a doe and a spotted fawn came and stood ankle deep in the water . and ate of the lily-pads , thorpe lurked motionless behind his screen of leaves . and as he had taken the precaution so to station himself that his hiding place lay downwind .
for an instant the voices of freshman year surged around them and then they looked at each other with faint tears in their eyes . the last light fades and drifts across the land . the low , long land , the sunny land of spires . the ghosts of evening tune again their lyres and wander singing in a plaintive band down the long corridors of trees . pale fires echo the night from tower top to tower .
seen down the length of the laboratory , manning looked a very handsome and shapely gentleman indeed . and , at the sight of his eager advance to his fiancee . miss [female] replaced one long cherished romance about ann veronica by one more normal and simple . he carried a cane and a silk hat with a mourning band in one gray gloved hand . his frock coat and trousers were admirable ; his handsome face .
i am member of parliament for [male] . as you used to be in the days which i can first remember , i hope you wo not think that it does not make me unhappy to have differed from you . indeed it does , i do not think that anybody has ever done so well in politics as you have . but when a man does take up an opinion i do not see how he can help himself . of course i could have kept myself quiet .
by the time i came home it was dark night . and pouring again with a foggy rain , such as we have in july . even more than in january , being soaked all through , and through , and with water quelching in my boots . like a pump with a bad bucket , i was only too glad to find annie 's bright face . and quick figure , flitting in and out the firelight , instead of [female] sitting grandly .
you ought to understand me by this time . why will you not tell me the truth ? i am no poet , -- except in heart . through love , through you , oh , what power of affection there is in me to keep me here in this hotel . instead of mounting to ingouville which i can see from my windows , will you ever love me as i love you ?
the minutes ticked on , and the constable did not arrive , wildeve cooled down from his state of high indignation to a restless dissatisfaction with himself . the scene , the constable 's wife . and the whole set of circumstances , he arose and left the house . altogether , the experience of that evening had had a cooling . not to say a chilling , effect on misdirected tenderness .
he would be no true friend if he kept his [male] about such a matter . then , in my haste , i retorted that to me the friendship between [male] did not seem so perfect and complete as it did to him . one condition of friendship is that the partners in it should be known to each other . he had had my whole life and mind open to him . to read it as in a book , his life was a closed and clasped volume to me .
on this question i was still pausing , when the moon . so dim hitherto , seemed to shine out somewhat brighter : a [female] gleamed even white before me . and a shadow became distinct and marked , i looked more narrowly , to make out the cause of this well defined contrast appearing a little suddenly in the obscure alley . whiter and blacker it grew on my eye . it took shape with instantaneous transformation .
they played with the past , and with the great figures of the past . a sort of little game of chess . or marionettes , all to please themselves , they had all the great men for their marionettes . and they two were the god of the show . working it all , as for the future , that they never mentioned except one laughed out some mocking dream of the destruction of the world by a ridiculous catastrophe of man 's invention .
the trumpet major drew [female] 's discourse off the subject as soon as he could . and [male] , after some unconsidered replies and remarks . seemed willing to avoid it for the present , he did not ask [male] to accompany him home . as he had intended ; and on leaving the barracks turned southward and entered the town to wander about till he could decide what to do . the town clock struck , and [male] retraced his steps till he again approached the esplanade and [organization] .
opening her eyes again , and seeing her husband 's face across the table . she leaned forward to give it a pat on the cheek . and sat down to supper , declaring it to be the best face in the world . the secretary lost no time in getting to work , and his vigilance and method soon set their mark on the golden dustman 's affairs . his earnestness in determining to understand the length and breadth and depth of every piece of work submitted to him by his employer .
they hastened down the hill , and on getting into the road waited and listened again . travellers began to come up and pass them in vehicles of all descriptions . it was difficult to attract their attention in the dim light . but by standing on the top of a wall which fenced the road [male] was at last seen . `` what 's the matter ? '' he cried to a butcher who was flying past in his cart .
it is not right to say so , as the acquisition of every object pre supposes at all events some exertion on the part of man . the application of proper means may be said to be the cause of gaining all our ends . and this application of proper means being thus necessary ( even where a thing is destined to happen ) . it follows that a person who does nothing will enjoy no happiness . those who are inclined to think that artha is the chief object to be obtained argue thus .
we all of us , even the greatest of us . have our moments of weakness , let [female] then not express any surprise at the sudden collapse of one of the world 's greatest female thinkers . as the meaning of this speech smote on mrs. [female] understanding . she sank weeping into a chair , the ever present fear that had haunted her had been exorcised . windles was hers in perpetuity .
`` that brings me to my strong point , '' exclaimed the soldier hopefully . `` my father is better off than most non commissioned officers '' fathers ; and there 's always a home for you at his house in any emergency . i can tell you privately that he has enough to keep [male] both . and if you would not hear of barracks , well , [male] once established . i would live at home as a [male] and farmer .
but after his letter had been entrusted to the landlord 's little son . who was a particular friend of susy 's , [male] had decided to await the lad 's return . the messenger had not been bidden to ask for an answer ; but [male] . knowing the friendly and inquisitive italian mind , was almost sure that the boy , in the hope of catching a glimpse of susy . would linger about while the letter was carried up , and he pictured the maid knocking at his wife 's darkened room .
her stepmother saw after that , she disliked anything old or shabby . or out of taste about her ; it hurt her eye . and she had already fidgeted molly into a new amount of care about the manner in which she put on her clothes . arranged her hair , and was gloved and shod . mrs. [female] had tried to put her through a course of rosemary washes and creams in order to improve her tanned complexion .
all this comes to me quite seriously now : i used to laugh thinking it over . but can a single thing we do be called trivial , since out of it we grow up minute by minute into a whole being charged with capacity for gladness or suffering ? now , as i look back , all these atoms of memory are dust and ashes that i have walked through in order to get to present things . how i suffer , how i suffer , if you could have dreamed that a human body could contain so much suffering . i think you would have chosen a less dreadful way of showing me your will .
he watched her face narrowly while he spoke with such seeming carelessness . instead of the agitation of jealousy that he had expected to be aroused by this hint of another woman in the case . there was a curious expression , more like embarrassment than anything else which might have been fairly attributed to the subject . `` can it be that i am [male] ? '' he asked himself . the possibility that he might be [male] restored [male] to good humour .
the hotel seemed the brightest and soundest living spot in the place . for it was painted in green , like a watermelon , with a cottonwood tree growing beside the pump at the porch corner . in yellow letters upon the windowpane of the office there appeared the proprietor 's name . doubtless the work of some wandering artist who had paid the price of his lodging or his dinner so . said the sign , bedded in curlicues and twisted ornaments .
the empress and the marquise became real people to miss ainslie . and the japanese lovers seemed to smile at her from the vase . sometimes , holding the rug on her lap , she would tell them how it was woven . and repeat the love story of a beautiful woman who had worked upon the tapestry . often , in the twilight , she would sing softly to herself , snatches of forgotten melodies .
this first ill consequence of this fray was , that the woman they had taken . who was really the thief , made off , and got clear away in the crowd . and two other that they had stopped also ; whether they were really guilty or not . that i can say nothing to , then i proceeded to tell how the journeyman treated me . how they would not suffer me to send for any of my friends .
but he had no sooner made this reflexion than [female] found something . she had decided , on the whole , to take the thing as a joke . `` perhaps he will do it the next time ! '' she exclaimed , with a repetition of her laugh . and she quickly got out of the room , the doctor stood staring .
it is necessary , whether you [male] . or do not [male] , [male] , indeed , why does not your voice ascend to heaven with one loud wail against the cruelty of man ? then he went forth from the room into an empty chamber on the other side of the passage . and his wife , when she followed him there after a few minutes . found him on his knees , with his forehead against the floor .
though she could still call up that phase of feeling it had long since passed . and the house had for a time become to her the very symbol of narrowness and monotony . then , with the passing of years , it had gradually acquired a less inimical character . had become , not again a castle of dreams , evoker of fair images and romantic legend . but the shell of a life slowly adjusted to its dwelling .
the moonlight slept in silver upon the creek . the tall trees stood dreaming to the stars . the lapping of the tide against the bank was no louder than the music of a river . she sat down upon the bench and strove to gather some of the quietude of that summer night into her heart . and to learn from the growing things of nature about her something of their patience and their extraordinary perseverance .
`` questions '' scored a hit and made no end of fun . some one asked : `` who is the biggest fool in the room ? '' and when the number was called and master white proved to hold the duplicate . the boy smiled , for retribution occasionally overtakes those who wear too fine clothes . a young folks party in those days would be no party at all unless there were some kissing games . and when toward the close of this one , somebody proposed they wind up with `` copenhagen , ''
two doors near her opened curiously at the sound of a feminine voice . a tentative cough sounded from above , gathering her skirts , [female] dived wildly down the last flight . and was swallowed up in the murky [location] air outside . on thursday night [male] tarbox sat in an aisle seat in the fifth row and witnessed `` home [male] . '' oddly enough he found that he was enjoying himself .
so it mishapped that sir agravaine on a day said openly . so that many knights might hear , that the friendship between sir [female] and the queen was a disgrace to knighthood and a shame to so noble a king as [male] . but sir gawaine would not hear any of these tales nor be of agravaine 's counsel . moreover he charged his brother to move no such matters afore him . for he wist well what mischief would come , should war arise betwixt sir [male] and the king .
about five , when the children had had their tea , she and her mother went for a short walk . very often they strolled through victoria station . amused by the bustle of the traffic , or maybe they wandered down the [female] palace road . attracted by the shops , and there was a sad pleasure in these walks . the elder woman had borne years of exceeding trouble .
so they came together as fast as their horses might run ; and [male] smote the other so that his spear went through the knight 's shoulder and smote him down off his horse . and in the falling [male] 's spear brake , with that came out another knight from the leaves . and brake a spear upon [male] before he might turn about , then [male] drew out his sword and smote this one so that he fled away . and sir [male] pursued fast after him , but soon he turned again unto sir melias . and there he alighted and placed him softly on his horse before him .
the light , gushing from the opaque hood . made the safe door a glare , and was thrown back into her intent . masked face , throwing out in sharp silhouette her lithe . sweet body , indisputably identified by the individual poise of her head and shoulders and the gracious contours of her tailored coat . she was all in [female] , even to her hands .
erec dismounts from his horse , which the host himself leads away by the bridle . and does great honour to his guest , the vavasor summons his wife and his beautiful daughter . who were busy in a work room -- doing i know not what , the lady came out with her daughter . who was dressed in a soft white under robe with wide skirts hanging loose in folds . over it she wore a white linen garment .
amen : there is no need that i should . beloved : i have not written to you for quite a long time . ah , i could not , i have nothing now to say ! i think i could very easily die of this great happiness . so certainly do you love me , just a breath more of it and i should be gone .
about that other subject i had rather say nothing . i have known your [male] all my life , almost . and i regard no one more kindly than i do him . when i think of my friends , he is always one of the dearest , but when one thinks of going beyond friendship . even if one tries to do so , there are so many barriers , mamma bids me say that she would be delighted to have you here whenever it might suit you to come .
if i had noticed no other alteration in her than this welcome change for the better . my record of the day would have ended here , as the record of unmixed happiness . but , i grieve to say , i have something unpleasant to add , while she was making her excuses to me . and speaking in the sensible and satisfactory terms which i have just repeated , i noticed a curious underlying embarrassment in her manner . entirely unlike any previous embarrassment which had ever intruded itself between us .
as we neared the high tower a patrol shot down from above . throwing its piercing searchlight full upon my craft . and a voice roared out a command to halt , following with a shot as i paid no attention to his hail . [male] dropped quickly into the darkness , while i rose steadily and at terrific speed raced through the martian sky followed by a dozen of the air scout craft which had joined the pursuit . and later by a swift cruiser carrying a hundred men and a battery of rapid fire guns .
in the east , behind [male] , there was only one clear porch in the heavens . which was rapidly being closed , without any feeling of wind abroad , a strange flight of grey downy particles seemed to pass . they were fine and scattered as if some gigantic bird had been plucked of its plumage behind the bank of cloud . a dark compact roof had gradually formed itself , which on the verge of the horizon touched the sea . and mingled in darkness with it , the beholder had a vague sense of something advancing steadily towards him .
i drew it out and set it on the table . and then , in the midst of the most perfect silence , i inserted the strange-looking silver key . and pressed this way and that until at last the lock yielded , and the casket stood before us . it was filled to the brim with some brown shredded material . more like vegetable fibre than paper , the nature of which i have never been able to discover .
he found the three sitting round the hearth , with an air of anxiety about them . as if they dared not venture to speak aloud . the priest seemed to be praying in his inmost spirit that all evil might be averted . when , however , they saw the young husband come forth so cheerfully the careworn expression of their faces vanished . the old fisherman even began to jest with the knight , so pleasantly , that the aged wife smiled good humoredly as she listened to them .
with an air as if her self possession had been pricked with a pin in some secret place . and i -- you know how stupid i can be at times . i perceived with dismay for the first time that by pandering to [female] 's morbid fancies i had let myself in for some more severe exercise . and was not i sorry i spoke , you know how i hate walking -- at least on solid , rural earth . for i can walk a ship 's deck a whole foggy night through .
her young and splendid body seemed to her a temple out of which she had driven the love god . the deity of motherhood and the glowing lights of wholesome sex ... and where she had set up instead a pale allegiance of soulless form . her life seemed a thing of quenched torches and unlit lamps . conscience tollman was in a dangerous mood .
and she was not at a loss to suggest to herself another subject . her [female] had learned something about her money which he felt himself bound to tell her . but which he would not have told her now had she consented to remain at the cedars . there was something wrong about the loan , this made her seriously unhappy , for she dreaded the necessity of discussing her brother 's conduct with her [female] . during the whole of the day lady ball was very courteous .
and [female] , anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything reprehensible . looked round with a blush , it seemed to him that everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself . a little later when he went up to the large circle , [male] pavlovna said to him . `` i hear you are refitting your petersburg house ? '' this was true , the architect had told him that it was necessary .
he endeavoured to call to memory all that he had ever known or heard of the glenallan family . yet , having done so , remained altogether unable to form a conjecture on the subject . he knew that the whole extensive estate of this ancient and powerful family had descended to the countess . lately deceased , who inherited , in a most remarkable degree , the stern , fierce , and unbending character which had distinguished the house of glenallan since they first figured in scottish annals . like the rest of her ancestors , she adhered zealously to the roman catholic faith .
javert did not accept such comminations , and would have bristled up against such compromises . but his squad included other inspectors besides himself . who were more initiated than he , perhaps , although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the prefecture . and claquesous had been such a villain that he might make a very good agent . it is an excellent thing for ruffianism and an admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night .
what reader is there , male or female , of such stories as is this . who has not often discussed in his or her own mind the different sides of this question of love and marriage ? on either side enough may be said by any arguer to convince at any rate himself . it must be wrong for a man , whose income is both insufficient and precarious also . not only to double his own cares and burdens , but to place the weight of that doubled burden on other shoulders besides his own .
the figure was strangely still ; so still that , as she peered through the dusk . she half fancied it might be an optical illusion . she advanced a few steps , hesitatingly , then stopped , as she did so . the man advanced a few steps , then stopped , as he came out from the shadows of the trees . she saw that he was of alessandro 's height .
our oarsmen were so fresh , by dint of having occasionally let her drive with the tide for a minute or two . that a quarter of an hour 's rest proved full as much as they wanted . we got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us . and looked about , it was like my own marsh country , flat and monotonous . and with a dim horizon ; while the winding river turned and turned .
for an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers . but if the man was not [male] , and if this man was not a good . honest old fellow living on his income . he was probably some [male] blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of parisian misdeeds . some chief of a dangerous band , who gave alms to conceal his other talents .
suddenly the dressing room door opened and the maid came out by herself , carrying bundles . he stopped her and asked how her [female] was . the woman laughed and said that she was quite well , but that he must not disturb her . for she wished to be left alone , and she passed on , one idea alone filled [male] 's burning brain . of course , daae wished to be left alone for him !
`` i can not think what people are doing , '' she would say . `` but it is extremely fortunate for the children , '' she called everywhere . her calls were returned with enthusiasm , and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their milieu . they liked her , and it did not seem to matter . when mr. [male] died , he had the satisfaction .
above the tunnel vault , in the city up there . certain dull reports , the train started up again , at that moment a man quite out of his senses . who covered up his face with his hands , came running down the stairway of the station and rolled down on the floor at the bottom . there was just enough time to catch sight of the blood that trickled through his fingers ... then the tunnel and darkness again , in the car frightened outcries .
the weather was fine next day , and the castle party drove ten miles to a rustic racecourse . where there was a meeting of a very insignificant character , but interesting to mr. [male] . to whom a horse was a source of perennial delight . and a fair excuse for a long gay drive . and a picnic luncheon in carriages and on coach boxes .
the [organization] had started half an hour before he reached the station . and he had to wait an hour and a quarter for a slow train to take him to his destination . [male] chafed cruelly at this delay , half a dozen vessels might sail for [location] while he roamed up and down the long platform . tumbling over trucks and porters , and swearing at his ill luck . he bought the times newspaper .
arrived at the foot of the back stairs , he desired them to wait . if the king was still irritated against them , they would depart without being seen . if the king consented to see them , they would only have to be called . on arriving at the king 's private antechamber , [male] found [male] chesnaye . who informed him that they had not been able to find [male] tremouille on the preceding evening at his hotel .
and his shadow on the border of the pond . was watching for a few moments , then he stooped and groped on the ground . then again there was a burst of sound , and a burst of brilliant light . the moon had exploded on the water , and was flying asunder in flakes of white and dangerous fire . rapidly , like white birds , the fires all broken rose across the pond .
sophy viner had not shown herself at dinner . so that he had had no glimpse of her in her new character . and no means of divining the real nature of the tie between herself and owen leath . one thing , however , was clear : whatever her real feelings were , and however much or little she had at stake . if she had made up her mind to marry owen she had more than enough skill and tenacity to defeat any arts that poor madame [female] chantelle could oppose to her .
but [female] on that morning was not at home to receive will 's note . in consequence of a letter from her uncle announcing his intention to be at home in a week . she had driven first to freshitt to carry the news , meaning to go on to the grange to deliver some orders with which her uncle had intrusted her . thinking , as he said , `` a little mental occupation of this sort good for a widow . '' unwonted circumstances may make [male] all rather unlike ourselves .
priest , a contract of eternal bond of love . confirm would by mutual joinder of your hands . attested by the holy close of lips . strengthen would by interchangement of your rings . and all the ceremony of this compact seal would in my function .
`` ah , my dear sire , '' and the tears gushed from her eyes . the coachman stopped his team ; the women rose in confusion from the back of the carriage . and the second lady made a slight curtsey , terminated by the most ironical smile that jealousy ever imparted to the lips of woman . [female] , dear [male] , cried the king . taking the hand of the black eyed lady in both his , and opening the heavy door himself .
the uneasiness of [male] now encreased every moment . and mr monckton , seeing he had no other chance of satisfying her . offered his service to go again in search of both the gentlemen . and endeavour to bring her better information , she accepted the proposal with gratitude . and he departed , he was scarce gone when she was told that mr delvile begged to have the honour of speaking to her .
in 1789 a ferment arises in [location] ; it grows . spreads , and is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east . several times it moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from [location] . in 1812 it reaches its extreme limit , [location] , and then . with remarkable symmetry , a countermovement occurs from east to west .
the latter part of the day turning out wet . they were fain to keep the house , look over mr [male] 's collection . and beguile the time with conversation , this [male] had plenty to say for himself . and said it in an off hand and amusing manner . he appeared to be an artist by profession .
beneath the serene unconcern of [female] 's face was a boiling tumult . she was furiously angry , she gazed with a quiet detachment toward the window and the oxford street traffic . and in her heart she was busy kicking this man to death . he had followed her , what had he followed her for ? he must have followed her all the way from beyond grosvenor square .
while the answer was passing my lips miss [female] glided into view on the terrace for the third time . instead of proceeding on her walk , she stopped . with her back turned towards us . and , leaning on the balustrade of the terrace , looked down into the garden beyond . my eyes fixed upon the white gleam of her muslin gown and head dress in the moonlight .
she could not tell , neither could she understand the profound but distant consideration with which mr. [male] endeavored to behave to her . treating her like a stranger to whom he must , against his inclination . manifest all possible respect , while he did not invite her even to call at the villa. she bought a pair of gloves of the young woman who seemed to occupy her place . paid for them , and left the shop without speaking to any one else , all the time . [female] was standing behind the opposite counter , staring at her ; but , much to her relief .
mrs. [female] regarded captain [female] 's intercourse with maud with much interest . which she did not attempt to disguise , while her daughter did so under the disguise of indifference . but with the most intense interest , not a word , look , or sign between them betrayed the least token of any understanding or peculiar confidence as existing between the commander and the quadroon . maud , on her part , began to change somewhat since the first day of the arrival of the strangers . then she was as free and unconstrained as innocence itself .
but after that look she could not let the animal go . its possession made life warmer . and it was good to see it lying in front of her open fire of mesquite roots . he had made , soon after their coming to the ranch , a cactus fence round the house enclosure . and seeing the dry ugliness of the long , straight sticks placed close together , [female] disliked and wondered at it .
[female] made no effort to follow , for two or three minutes he stood like a man turned suddenly into hewn rock . staring with unseeing eyes into the gloom where jeanne had disappeared . then he walked back to the edge of the spruce . there he drew his revolver , and cocked it . the starlight revealed a madness in his face as he approached [male] 's cabin .
there was a low knock at the door , a strange feeling crept over [female] 's heart . as if something spiritual were near ; as if the dead , so lately present in her dreams . were yet gliding and hovering round her , with their dim , dread forms . and yet , why dread ? had they not loved her ? and who loved her now ? was she not lonely enough to welcome the spirits of the dead .
[female] densher , who passed the best hours of each night at the office of his newspaper . had at times , during the day , to make up for it . a sense , or at least an appearance , of leisure . in accordance with which he was not infrequently to be met , in different parts of the town . at moments when men of business are hidden from the public eye .
he held her arm and abandoned it again at her quick defensive movement . for a long time neither spoke again , she sat drawn together in her chair in the corner of the box . at a loss what to say or do -- afraid , curious , perplexed , it seemed to her that it was her duty to get up and clamor to go home to her room . to protest against his advances as an insult , but she did not in the least want to do that . these sweeping dignities were not within the compass of her will ; she remembered she liked ramage .
`` keep them right there , '' was the duke 's caution . jerking his head to [male] in the manner of a signal understood . [male] rode up to the fence cutters and disarmed them . holding his gun comfortably in their ribs as he worked with swift hand . the rifle he handed down to the old negro .
two things were still anxiously expected -- the presence of the glenallan volunteers . who , in consideration of the importance of that family . had been formed into a separate corps , and the arrival of the officer before announced . to whom the measures of defence on that coast had been committed by the commander in chief . and whose commission would entitle him to take upon himself the full disposal of the military force .
the `` senior prom , '' as it was called , was the annual reception which the senior class gave in the middle of every autumn term . it was the smartest and gayest of all the college functions . and a payzant co-ed who received an invitation to it counted herself fortunate . the senior girls were included as a matter of course . but a junior , soph , or freshie could not go unless one of the senior boys invited her .
to justify the course he had adopted the dictates of duty must have been imperative . but the trumpet major , with a becoming reticence which his brother at the time was naturally unable to appreciate . scarcely dwelt distinctly enough upon the compelling cause of his conduct . it would , indeed , have been hard for any man , much less so modest a one as [male] . to do himself justice in that remarkable relation , when the listener was the lady 's lover .
emil gripped the hand holds of his scythe and began to mow . [female] took up her cherries and went slowly toward the house , crying bitterly . on sunday afternoon , a month after [male] arrival . he rode with emil up into the french country to attend a catholic fair . he sat for most of the afternoon in the basement of the church .
mrs. [female] , after a little while observed . `` it was a beautiful morning , '' sandford cried . `` for his part he slept too well to know , '' and then held a plate with biscuits to miss milner . it was the first civility he had ever in his life offered her . she smiled at the whimsicality of the circumstance .
philip vaulted into the field , and was instantly seized by every woman working in it . except [female] , tied up with the straw ropes , and only liberated on paying the toll of an intruder . [female] had not looked up when [female] came into the field . but she had seen him come , and she gave a little start when he took his place in his shirt sleeves beside her . he used some conventional phrases which she scarcely answered .
but she had deserved the sufferings which had come upon her . even [female] , whose heart was very tender toward her . owned as much as that , she had sold herself , as she had said of herself more than once . she had given herself to a man whom she regarded not at all . even when her heart belonged to another -- to a man whom she must have loathed and despised when she was putting her hand into his before the altar .
again there was a long pause -- in which the lapse of time was incalculable . time had no meaning here : men waited from incident to incident only . the moving of a line of steel caps . a pause in the music , a head thrust out from a closed window and drawn back again ... again the music broke out , and this time it was an air that they played .
thanks to the lateral point of the stone anvil . which served the part of the conoid bicorn . he was able to forge rings rude in shape but strong . with these he fastened together the severed lengths of chains . and made long pieces , to work at a forge without assistance is something more than troublesome .
the only thing that worried father was the fact that their project put upon mother so great a burden in the way of preparations . at first he took it for granted that only women could know about tea and tea cups . decorations and paper napkins and art and the disposal of garbage . he determined to learn , by dint of much deep ratiocination while riding in the elevated between flat and store he evolved the new idea , cheapness . it was nonsense , he decided , to have egg shell [location] and to charge fifteen cents for tea .
in the shack , this last day of may afternoon . stood leaning over a rough table the man of the laugh . [male] mckay , known as jolly [male] . outlaw extraordinary , and sought by the men of every royal northwest mounted police patrol north of the height of land . it was incongruous and inconceivable to think of him as an outlaw .
there never were any contrary minded when mrs. jere [female] was in the chair . public sentiment in edgewood was swayed by the dorcas society . but mrs. [female] swayed the dorcases themselves as the wind sways the wheat . the old meeting house wore an animated aspect when the eventful friday came . a cold , brilliant , sparkling december day , with good sleighing .
she used such phrases of the gipsy jargon as she had picked up . and made jokes and bantering speeches which set their host cackling with laughter . [female] had seen her play a fantastic part before on their whimsical holidays . but never one which suited her so well , and in which she seemed so full of fire and daring wit . she was no duchess , a man might have sworn .
i hesitated but for a single instant , long enough to ask myself what she meant in particular by this condition . first it struck me that she must have really a large sum in her mind . then i reasoned quickly that her idea of a large sum would probably not correspond to my own . my deliberation , i think , was not so visible as to diminish the promptitude with which i replied . `` i will pay with pleasure and of course in advance whatever you may think is proper to ask me . ''
`` take some , then , and come back immediately , '' barrois took away the waiter . and hardly was he outside the door , which in his haste he forgot to shut . than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which [male] had filled . [male] and [male] were exchanging their [organization] in the presence of noirtier when a ring was heard at the door bell . it was the signal of a visit .
it nearly broke my heart to dispel her delusion . and to bring her face to face with the hard truth . i was obliged to tell her that no man tolerates a rival -- not even a woman rival . in his wife 's affections , when he first marries . whatever he may do afterwards , i was obliged to warn her that my chance of living with her permanently under her own roof .
that wench ll be troth plight to th first man as ll wed her and keep her i ', plenty . that 's a she thinks about , replied bell , scornfully , one day [female] had seen her sitting near her mother in the market place . there was a basket by her , and over the clean cloth that covered the yellow pounds of butter . she had laid the hedge roses and honeysuckles she had gathered on the way into monkshaven . her straw hat was on her knee .
and yet , according to the doctors , the patient held her own , certain alarming symptoms had diminished . and while others persisted , the strength to fight them persisted too . with such strength to call on , what fresh agonies were reserved for the poor body when the narcotics had lost their power ? that was the question always before [female] , she never again betrayed her fears to wyant . she carried out his orders with morbid precision .
`` you love him , katharine , '' rodney said suddenly , his tone had lost something of its sternness . and might have been used to urge a child to confess its fault , she raised her eyes and fixed them upon him . `` now , '' she said suddenly , with a sort of desperation . rising from her chair and seeming to command rodney to fulfil his part .
after that it was not unusual for her to go to the trenches , on such nights as no men could come to the little house . always she was joyously welcomed , and always on her way back she turned to send from the poplar trees that inarticulate aching call that she had come somehow to believe in . january , wet and raw , went by . february , colder , with snow , was half over , the men had ceased to watch for [male] over the parapet . and his brave deeds had become fireside tales .
javert was a complete character , who never had a wrinkle in his duty or in his uniform . methodical with malefactors , rigid with the buttons of his coat . that he should have set the buckle of his stock awry . it was indispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes . he had come in a simple way , had made a requisition on the neighboring post for a corporal and four soldiers .
the next evening we were seated in front of a bright fire in a dainty little salon . she on a couch , i on cushions almost at her feet . looking up into her face , the street was silent , the lamp shed a soft light . it was one of those evenings which delight the soul . one of those moments which are never forgotten , one of those hours passed in [female] and longing .
he heard her voice clear and commanding . crying out their names -- tyr , captain , [male] . thor , wamba -- until their number seemed without end . he heard the metallic snap of fangs . quick , panting breaths , the shuffling of padded feet .
every one had bundled out early to see the sunrise , consequently most members of the set were cross or hungry , or both . nothing could be less suitable than to clamour for porridge on the nile . but they did it , and called for bacon . too , in a land where the pig is an unclean animal . they were the same people who played `` coon can ''
three days afterwards , between twelve and one . just the busiest time , when the bar was full of people . there came a cry of `` police , '' an effort was made to hide the betting plant . a rush was made for the doors , it was all too late . the sergeant and a constable ordered that no one was to leave the house .
she acted astonishment and admiration . kneeling , he laid the treasure at her feet . incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks and gestures . the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the rings in her ears . it was eliezer and [male] .
[female] , but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear that this `` little trial '' would be harder than the others , and that laurie would not get over his `` lovelornity '' as easily as heretofore . the plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon . for mrs. [female] gladly accepted jo . and promised to make a [female] home for her , the teaching would render her independent .
bun , patience , i have long loved you . let me tell you a secret , i am not as bilious as i look . if you like , i will cut my hair , there is more innocent fun within me than a casual spectator would imagine . you have never seen me frolicsome , be a good girl . a very good girl -- and one day you shall .
monk followed with the greatest attention the rapid , heightened , and diffuse conversation of the fisherman . in a language which was not his own , but which , as we have said . he spoke with great facility , the fisherman . on his part , employed sometimes a french word , sometimes an english word . and sometimes a word which appeared not to belong to any language , but was .
`` i have just met marius '' new hat and new coat . with marius inside them , he was going to pass an examination , no doubt . he looked utterly stupid , on turning into the walk . he saw [female] leblanc and the young girl at the other end . `` on their bench , '' he buttoned his coat up to the very top .
and like a cavalier of old he touched his lips gently to the palm of yellow bird 's little brown hand . days of new hope and gladness followed in the camp of yellow bird and slim buck . it was as if mckay , after a long absence . had come back to his own people , the tenderness of mother and sister lay warm in yellow bird 's breast . slim buck loved him as a brother .
there had been no renewed cry for help when the key was turned for the last time . there was no sound now of any kind , to give token that he was still alive . i heard nothing but the quickening crackle of the flames . and the sharp snap of the glass in the skylight above . i looked round at my two companions .
the library was a mighty hall . lighted from the roof , which was formed of something like glass . vaulted over in a single piece , and stained throughout with a great mysterious picture in gorgeous colouring . the walls were lined from floor to roof with books and books . most of them in ancient bindings , but some in strange new fashions which i had never seen .
he knows that he will survive at the end of things . and be gathered by fate as a jewel from the slime . and be handed with admiration round the assembly of the gods . `` men did produce this , '' they will say , and , saying , they will give men immortality . but meanwhile -- what agitations meanwhile , the foundations of property and propriety are laid bare , twin rocks .
[female] had watched his [male] 's dash for the open with a consternation so complete that his sense seemed to have left him . a general , deserted by his men on some stricken field , might have felt something akin to his emotion . of all the learned professions , the imitation of mr. [male] tinney is the one which can least easily be carried through single handed . the man at the piano , the leader of the orchestra , is essential . he is the life blood of the entertainment .
the car stirred , crept forward one inch , and settled back -- one inch . the second time it heaved encouragingly but did not make quite so much headway . then claire did sob , she rubbed her cheek against the comfortable . rough , heather smelling shoulder of her father 's coat . while he patted her and smiled , good girl !
his mind worked swiftly and surely as to the method of his first night 's flight . there were always a number of boats down at crossen 's place . he would start in one of these , and by the time mercer discovered he was gone . he would be forty miles on his way to freedom . then he would set his boat adrift .
the window had been left open ; for even in the bleak autumn weather the atmosphere of the great house seemed hot and oppressive to its living inmates . whose spirits were weighed down by a vague sense of the awful presence in that [location] mansion . [female] had wandered to this open window , scarcely knowing whither she went . after remaining for a long time on her knees by the threshold of her father 's room . with her head resting against the oaken panel of the door , not praying .
they are nothing but good to me . i love them dearly ; no people could ever be kinder to a thankless creature than they always are to me . do , do go away , for i am afraid of you . i am afraid of myself when i feel my temper coming . and i am as much afraid of you , go away from me , and let me pray and cry myself better !
i looked at my watch , it was one o ', clock . i had slept seven hours , and she had been steering seven hours ! when i took the steering oar i had first to unbend her cramped fingers . her modicum of strength had been exhausted , and she was unable even to move from her position . i was compelled to let go the sheet while i helped her to the nest of blankets and chafed her hands and arms .
it was a bare room . lit with one window , against which mrs . [female] 's austere figure appeared in dark grey silhouette . the window looked on one of the little back courts and tiled ways which had been built at the back of the house . and the shadowed northern light softened the listening faces with grey tints .
when the guests were gone , and [female] had gone to bed . mrs. [female] paced up and down the drawing room . discussing her little party with her son , mrs. [male] was a nice woman . but her personality , like many another 's , had been swamped by [location] , for it needs a strong head to live among many people . the too vast orb of her fate had crushed her ; and she had seen too many seasons .
i felt in my heart she would die . if she did not go home , and with this conviction obtained her recall . she had only been three months at school . and it was some years before the experiment of sending her from home was again ventured on . after the age of twenty , having meantime studied alone with diligence and perseverance .
the gods of the world , -- of lady [male] 's world . had met together and come to a great decision , lady [female] was to be removed in october to gatherum castle . and remain there till the following spring , so that the heir might , in truth . be born in the purple , `` it is such a bore , '' said lady [female] , and i know it will be a girl .
a bliss , or an insanity , which the unhappy pair imagined to be well worth the sleepy innocence that was forever lost to them . as their spirits rose to the solemn madness of the occasion . they went onward , not stealthily , not fearfully , but with a stately gait and aspect . passion lent them its brief nobility of carriage . they trod through the streets of [female] .
then it befell that king anguish of [location] sent unto king mark of cornwall for his truage . that cornwall had paid many winters , and all that time king mark was behind of the truage for seven years . and king mark and his barons gave unto the messenger of [location] these words and answer . that they would none pay ; and bade the messenger go unto his king anguish . and tell him we will pay him no truage .
the commissary , who had till this time held his head down over his papers . looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with . this commissary was a man of very repulsive mien . with a pointed nose , with yellow and salient cheek bones . with eyes small but keen and penetrating , and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox .
the ladies stirred softly in their draperies after he was gone . they turned and faced the hearth , where a log burned in a bed of hot ashes . softly purring and ticking to itself , and whilst they stood pressing their hands against the warm fronts of their dresses . as the fashion of women is before a fire . the clock on the mantel began to strike twelve .
im [female] on a plan to end the war . i got [female] , as i will . an it struck me that no one had gone into this at all . there all figurin how to go on with it but none of em how to quit it . dont say nothin till i get it worked out , i guess you always knew youd here from me when i got goin , eh mable ?
[female] uttered a groan and fell back in her chair . remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table . and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator , she turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying . when she met laurie 's eyes . which would look [male] in spite of his heroic efforts .
let [male] leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers . and return to [male] , for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started . but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right . made a circuit , and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop . having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal 's cloak .
the afternoon of the day on which the ball was to take place . a servant rode over from hamley with two lovely nosegays . with the mr hamleys compliments to miss [female] and miss kirkpatrick . [female] was the first to receive them , she came dancing into the drawing room . flourishing the flowers about in either hand , and danced up to molly , who was trying to settle to her reading .
you are now placed in a country and a condition in which you are not reduced to deceive or flatter any one . or debase yourself , as the greater part of those who seek their fortune in [location] are obliged to do . in which the exercise of no virtue is forbidden you . in which you may be , with impunity , good , sincere , well informed , patient , temperate . chaste , indulgent to others
her hair , in its dips and convolutions . was altogether a puzzle , `` how did she ever fix it like that ? '' her low evening dress -- what was it made of . some white stuff , but was it silk or muslin or what ? her shoulders were startling in their bare powdery smoothness --
a very little reflection , when the capacity to reflect returned , convinced her that any attempt to identify lady [female] and to rescue her by legal means . would , even if successful , involve a delay that might be fatal to her sister 's intellects . which were shaken already by the horror of the situation to which she had been consigned . by the time miss [female] had got back to [location] . she had determined to effect lady [female] 's escape privately .
marjorie explained , describing to him something of the system by which priests were safeguarded now in the north . the districts into which the county was divided , and the apportioning of the responsibilities among the faithful houses . it was her business . she said , to receive messages and to pass them on . she had entertained perhaps a dozen priests since the summer .
`` what i do take , i will take without complaint , '' said [female] . and then they kissed each other and parted , it must be remembered that [female] . among her miseries , had to suffer this : that since [female] 's departure . now nearly twelve months ago , she had not heard a word about him . or rather , she had only heard that he was very much in love with some lady in [location] .
these trees , which had already attained to a considerable size , he planted round their little enclosure . he had also sown the seed of many trees which the second year bear flowers or fruit . such as the agathis , encircled with long clusters of white flowers which hang from it like the crystal pendants of a chandelier . the persian lilac , which lifts high in air its gray flax coloured branches . the pappaw tree , the branchless trunk of which forms a column studded with green melons .
`` so she shall , my blessing , '' he often called her his `` blessing , '' which in truth she was , to see her now leaning her cheek against his . the small soft face , almost a miniature of his own , the hair . a paler shade of the same bright colour . curling in the same elastic rings -- they looked less like ordinary father and daughter .
the equinoctial gales begin early in the channel , the sea there is narrow . and the winds disturb it easily , the westerly gales begin from the month of february . and the waves are beaten about from every quarter , navigation becomes an anxious matter . the people on the coasts look to the signal post . and begin to watch for vessels in distress , the sea is then like a cut-throat in ambush for his victim .
by this time they had struck a descent in the road and were rushing along at breakneck speed into oppressive shadows that bore the first imprints of night . realizing at last that her cries were falling upon purposely deaf ears , beverly calhoun sank back into the seat . weak and terror stricken , it was plain to her that the horses were not running away . for the man had been lashing them furiously , there was but one conclusion . he was deliberately taking her farther into the mountain fastnesses .
when [male] was gone the timber merchant went on his way , he knew very well that [female] . whatever her own feelings , would either go or not go , according as he suggested . and his instinct was , for the moment , to suggest the negative , his errand took him past the church . and the way to his destination was either across the church yard or along side it . the distances being the same , for some reason or other he chose the former way .
she perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive foreboding in former times . he looked upon her as a species of imposter . a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one . terror was upon her white face as she saw it . her cheek was flaccid , and her mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole .
mrs [female] peremptorily forbade her to move . and , staring at her with a mixture of curiosity and harshness . ordered her to draw away her hand , she resisted for some time . but , overpowered by authoritative commands , was reduced , at length , to submit . and mrs [female] then perceived , that neither wound , scar , nor injury of any sort .
one of the professional calls made by [male] soon after his return from his wedding journey was to [male] manor . in consequence of a letter which had requested him to fix a time for his visit . mr. [male] had never put any question concerning the nature of his illness to [male] . nor had he even to [male] betrayed any anxiety as to how far it might be likely to cut short his labors or his life . on this point , as on all others , he shrank from pity .
but sir gawaine did not want to obey the king , he did not want to leave the feasting and merriment that followed the tournament . yet since all [male] 's [organization] had taken a vow of obedience . gawaine was ashamed not to go , so sulkily , like no true knight , he left the feast . and sir gawaine rode through the wood and past the hermitage where the wounded knight lay . and because he was thinking only of his own disappointment , his search was careless .
it was all the more astonishing because it had come so suddenly , and [female] could hardly tear mademoiselle away from the spot until she suggested that those at home might not have heard of it yet . and that she might be the first to tell it to them . hurrying through the town , they heard great shouting from the other side of the quay . which made mademoiselle nearly break into a run with eagerness . as it happened , however , the news had already spread to their street .
in short , as if materially , a compelling arm of extraordinary muscular power seized hold of him . something which had nothing in common with the spirits and influences that had moved him hitherto . this seemed to care little for his reason and his will , nothing for his so called elevated intentions . and moved him along , as a violent schoolmaster a schoolboy he has seized by the collar . in a direction which tended towards the embrace of a woman for whom he had no respect .
[female] , [female] , cried several voices from the outside . coming like a whirlwind into the cave , `` now , begone ; we depend on your loyalty . '' and he left his hold of the young man . who hastily returned towards the light , [male] , [male] ! cried the voices , still nearer , and the shadows of several human forms projected into the interior of the grotto .
i took it from her hand . she pointed me out the parlour door . the tray shook as i held it . the water spilt from the glass . my heart struck my ribs loud and fast , [female] opened the door for me .
i spent nearly a year prospecting in company with another confederate officer . captain [male] of [location] , we were extremely fortunate . for late in the winter of 1865 , after many hardships and privations . we located the most remarkable gold bearing quartz vein that our wildest dreams had ever pictured . [male] , who was a mining engineer by education .
so the maiden believes her nurse , and puts full confidence in her , one promises to the other . and gives her word , that this plot shall be kept so secret as never to be revealed . at this point their conversation ceases . and the next morning the emperor summons his daughter . at his command she goes to him .
sensible as i am that a novel writer , at a time when such a variety of works are ushered into the world under that name . stands but a poor chance for fame in the annals of literature . but conscious that i wrote with a mind anxious for the happiness of that sex whose morals and conduct have so powerful an influence on mankind in general . and convinced that i have not wrote a line that conveys a wrong idea to the head or a corrupt wish to the heart . i shall rest satisfied in the purity of my own intentions , and if i merit not applause .
suddenly the dog whirled about , the hair on his back bristling as he gave a threatening growl . a man on a [organization] colored mule was coming up the road . mr. [male] stood quietly by the corral gate when the horseman rode up . it was wash gibbs , on his way home from an all day visit with friends on the river . without returning mr. [male] 's greeting .
temporarily vauquelin returned entire attention to the management of the biplane . the wind was now blowing more fitfully , creating pockets -- those holes in the air so dreaded by cloud pilots . and in [male] of more constant resistance the aviator was swinging his craft in a wide northerly curve . climbing ever higher and more high , the earth soon lost all semblance of design . even the twisted silver wire of the seine vanished .
[male] had laid his hand on the soft arm that was nearest to him . and was stooping towards [male] with a look of coaxing entreaty . [female] lifted her long dewy lashes . and met the eyes that were bent towards her with a sweet . timid , beseeching look , what a space of time those three moments were while their eyes met and his arms touched her !
this hypothesis , indeed , could not be so easily reconciled with the alarm manifested by the bishop on learning that . contrary to his expectation , the scottish knight had suddenly returned to the crusaders ', camp . but [male] was influenced only by his general prejudices , which dictated to him the assured belief that a wily italian priest . a false hearted scot , and an infidel physician . formed a set of ingredients from which all evil .
the child did not look like either father or mother . instead , mr. [male] found himself looking into a face which he had put away under the grasses thirty years before . the face of his girl bride . who had died at [female] 's birth , here again were her lustrous gray black eyes . her ivory outlines , her fine traced arch of brow .
the fields , meadows , and fallow lands are so full of knights that it is impossible to estimate how many of them are there . but there was no sign of [male] at this first gathering of the knights . but later , when he entered the middle of the field . the herald saw him and could not refrain from crying out : behold him who will take the measure ! behold him who will take the measure , and the people ask him who he is .
but konstantin levin found it dull sitting and listening to him . especially when he knew that while he was away they would be carting dung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it . and heaping it all up anyhow ; and would not screw the shares in the ploughs . but would let them come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention . and there was nothing like the old andreevna plough .
never once in their dialogues did i hear a syllable of regret at the hospitality they had extended to me . or of suspicion of , or aversion to , myself . i was comforted . mr.john came but once : he looked at me . and said my state of lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue . he pronounced it needless to send for a doctor .
it was [male] to a satyr . was it not as impossible that [female] should not love the one , as that she should love the other ? [male] 's offer of his affections had at first probably been but a boyish ebullition of feeling . but if it should now be , that this had grown into a manly and disinterested love . how could [female] remain unmoved ? what could her heart want more .
[female] was feeling annoyed with her bees , they resolutely declined to sting this young man . bees flew past him , bees flew into him . bees settled upon his coat , bees paused questioningly in front of him . as who should say , `` what have we here ? '' but not a single bee molested him . yet when nutty , poor [male] , went within a dozen yards of the hives he never failed to suffer for it .
the house door was opened without any knocking or ringing . and [female] promptly helped her out , the servant who stood holding the door . asked no question of [male] , neither did he go before them or follow them as they went straight up stairs . it was only her husband 's encircling arm . urging her on , that prevented [male] from stopping at the foot of the staircase .
the customary expedient of provincial girls and men in such circumstances is churchgoing . in an ordinary village or country town one can safely calculate that . either on christmas day or the sunday contiguous , any native home for the holidays . who has not through age or ennui lost the appetite for seeing and being seen . will turn up in some pew or other , shining with hope , self consciousness , and new clothes .
terror and affliction seized upon [female] at this sight . her first impulse was to fly to lady [female] ; but she felt discouraged . and even awed , by the strangeness of the general taciturnity , occasioned by her appearance . her eyes next , anxiously , sought those of lord [female] , and instantly met them . but with a look of gravity so unusual , that her own were hastily withdrawn .
heaven only knew , here he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of talent . and he had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now scarcely believed he deserved . only luck had favored him , but he could not see that any one else might be said to deserve this wealth any more than himself . seeing that his use of it was as conservative and constructive and practical as the next one 's . he might have been born poor , in which case he would have been as well satisfied as the next one .
the days passed , and there was no more dulness or emptiness for [male] in his life at [location] . he went every day to the white walled cottage on the green . it was easy enough to find some fresh excuse for each visit . a book or a piece of music which he had recommended to miss [female] . and had procured from [location] for her , or something of an equally frivolous character .
i did not speak , i could think of nothing agreeable to say , the only words that rose to my lips were . `` how very ill you look , '' and i wisely concluded not to say them . she was very beautiful , and looked prouder and more imperious than ever , but she was changed . i could not tell what it was , i could find no name for the subtle alteration . ere long i knew only too well what it was , then , i only knew that she was different from what she had been .
i went straight to my own house to see if there were any letters from my father . there were four , in his first three letters my father inquired the cause of my silence . in the last he allowed me to see that he had heard of my change of life . and informed me that he was about to come and see me . i have always had a great respect and a sincere affection for my father .
as , on the evening of the party , she glanced at the image which her mirror reflected . she was pardonable for feeling a slight thrill of pleasure . [female] was in raptures , declaring nothing had ever been seen in [location] so perfectly lovely . and truly , [female] was beautiful as she stood there arrayed for the party . she was dressed in a french robe of [organization] .
do not be outraged , daddy , i am not intimating that the [female] grier home was like the lowood institute . we had plenty to eat and plenty to wear , sufficient water to wash in . and a furnace in the cellar , but there was one deadly likeness . our lives were absolutely monotonous and uneventful , nothing nice ever happened , except ice-cream on sundays . and even that was regular , in all the eighteen years i was there i only had one adventure .
i will keep my eyes open on your behalf . and shall let you know if anything happens , he said sympathetically . and [male] , remembering his kindness , did not like to remind him that . never having seen the man , he could not possibly be of much service to her . when mademoiselle therèse heard that she had seen the solicitor again .
sophie was not the most delightful companion in the world for such a place . [location] was her sphere , as she herself had understood when declaiming against those husbands who keep their wives in the country . and she had no love for the sea specially . regarding all winds as nuisances excepting such as had been raised by her own efforts . and thinking that salt from a saltcellar was more convenient than that brought to her on the breezes .
when the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up . tikhon came to call the young prince to his father , the old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son 's arrival . he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner . the old prince always dressed in old-fashioned style , wearing an antique coat and powdered hair . and when prince [male] entered his father 's dressing room ( not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms .
later , in august , the letters came from bar harbor . where [female] had followed , in company with the commodore 's wife . who seemed as nice as her husband ; and clover heard of all manner of delightful doings . sails , excursions , receptions on board ship . and long moonlight paddles with [male] , who was an expert canoeist .
he should have felt that his own sister was more original , and had greater vitality than miss hilbery had . but his main impression of katharine now was of a person of great vitality and composure . and at the moment he could not perceive what poor dear joan had gained from the fact that she was the granddaughter of a man who kept a shop . and herself earned her own living . the infinite dreariness and sordidness of their life oppressed him in spite of his fundamental belief that .
the men of the patrol listened , and heard nothing . they looked and saw nothing , they held a consultation . there existed at that epoch at this point of the montmartre sewer a sort of cross roads called [male] service . which was afterwards suppressed , on account of the little interior lake which formed there . swallowing up the torrent of rain in heavy storms .
her tone towards him to night was uniformly soothing and cajoling . and whenever he said `` i do not care what happens to me , '' a thing he did continually , she replied . `` but i do very much , '' the closing hour came , and they were compelled to turn out . whereupon [female] put her arm round his waist .
[female] began to pace up and down the room . smoking another cigarette at a great pace , rischenheim sat down by the table . resting his head on his hand , he was wearied out by strain and excitement . his wounded arm pained him greatly , and he was full of horror and remorse at the event which happened unknown to him the night before . `` i wish i was quit of it , ''
[female] had proved a kind husband . and in the seven years she had spent in the `` king 's head '' there had been some enjoyment of life , she could not say that she had been unhappy . she had always disapproved of the betting , they had tried to do without it . there was a great deal in life which one could not approve of .
to my delight she never once looked toward the beach . and i maintained the banter with such success all unconsciously she sipped coffee from [location] . ate fried evaporated potatoes , and spread marmalade on her biscuit . but it could not last , i saw the surprise that came over her . she had discovered the [location] plate from which she was eating .
all this had been done , and the mounted company , led by the magistrate himself . had come up from the valley in time to see the signalling from the heights ( contrived by the showing of lights now and again ) . which indicated that the priest was moving in the direction that had been expected , and that one man at least was on his track . they had waited there , in the valley , till the intermittent signals had reached the level ground and ceased . and had then ridden up cautiously in time to meet the informer 's companion .
[male] had often heard -- not from his father , for he never spoke on the subject . but from strangers -- the description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina . he had read different accounts of his death . but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl . and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him .
only i should like you sometimes to come and look at the old place , what i should like would be to pull down the house at [male] and build another . but you must not propose to put it off till that 's done , as i should never have the heart to do it . if you think that would suit you , i will make up my mind to live at [male] for a constancy . and then i would go in for a lot of cattle , and do not doubt i would make a fortune . i am almost sick of looking at the straight ridges in the big square fields every day of my life .
five of them were boys he had grown up with . the other was the little mulatto , babe divine , who was a wharf nigger round [location] . and long before that a plantation hand in bermuda . until he stuck an eight inch stiletto in his master 's back . almost before [male] realized his good fortune he was on broadway .
suspect her of having done anything wrong , and then , when he endeavoured to explain to her that a separation would be very injurious to herself . he had coupled her sister with her . thus seeming to imply that the injury to be avoided was of a material kind . she had better do what he told her . as , otherwise , she and her sister would not have a roof over their head !
[female] looked up with a smile which she tried not to make too glad . `` i think people were meant to be happy , a little , '' she said . they had lunch at [location] and then walked to [female] . where they had sent the carriage , they drove back . with a glorious sunset behind them , toward the distant gold washed city .
in his first glance he scarcely grasped the details of the scene . for the half drawn curtains kept the light dim , but as his eyes grew accustomed to the obscurity he gathered their significance . the room had a sleepless , jaded air . the room that under his own occupation had shown a rigid . almost monastic severity , the plain dressing table was littered with cigarette ends and marked with [male] and tawny patches where the tobacco had been left to burn itself out .
the latter had grown quite reconciled to her journeys to dinard now , and , as a matter of fact . was looking forward with regret to the time they must cease . she found the afternoons in the casino gardens with her friend very [female] . and came back each time full of ideas for altering everybody 's clothes . this she was not permitted to do , however , for mademoiselle loire had an unpleasant remembrance of similar plans on a previous occasion .
each wore a cap and a gray shawl ; each was knitting without haste and without rest . each rocked placidly and looked at the girls without speaking ; and just behind each sat a large white [location] dog . with round green spots all over it . a green nose and green ears , those dogs captured [male] 's fancy on the spot . they seemed like the twin guardian deities of [male] 's place .
philip muttered something , and held out the coin to captain kinraid . of course in vain ; nor was there time to urge it back upon the giver . for the obstacle to their progress was suddenly removed , the crowd pressed upon the captain and his wife . the procession moved on , and [male] along with it . holding the piece in his hand , and longing to throw it far away .
whereupon in the agony of those weeks in which the sagacious heads were resisting her love . lady [female] came to her [female] in queen [female] . and told [female] all that tale , `` was [female] , '' she asked , afraid of the marquises and the countesses . or of all the rank and all the money which they boasted ?
at the gate he hesitated , perhaps -- perhaps he was a little early . it might be better to walk round the block , he executed this parade . and again hesitated at the gate , he could see into the brightly lighted hall . beyond the open double doors ; and it contained nothing except its usual furniture . once more he walked round the block , the hall was again in the same condition .
here i am at lock willow for the summer . for ever maybe , the board is cheap ; the surroundings quiet and conducive to a literary life . what more does a struggling author wish ? i am mad about my book . i think of it every waking moment , and dream of it at night . all i want is [male] and quiet and lots of time to work .
with an attention infinitely more accurate , mr [male] had returned his observations . the uneasiness of his mind was apparent , and the anxious watchfulness of his eyes plainly manifested whence it arose . from a situation , indeed , which permitted an intercourse the most constant and unrestrained with such an object as [male] . nothing less could be expected , and therefore he considered his admiration as inevitable . all that remained to be discovered , was the reception it had met from his fair enslaver .
but in respect of his age , the grand master . as permitted by the rules , wore his doublet lined and trimmed with the softest lambskin . dressed with the wool outwards , which was the nearest approach he could regularly make to the use of fur . then the greatest luxury of dress , in his hand he bore that singular `` abacus '' . or staff of office , with which templars are usually represented .
a tailor and a weaver lived in some of the smaller houses we possessed . we had no need of the help of strangers . my mother also provided me with a good winter overcoat . it was really a capital overcoat . which covered me down to the very heels , a real menshikov overcoat .
we have got to get back to tea , i will take the revolver for a bit . maisie would have wept on the least encouragement , but [male] 's indifference . albeit his hand was shaking as he picked up the pistol , restrained her . she lay panting on the beach while [female] methodically bombarded the breakwater . `` got it at last , '' he exclaimed , as a lock of weed flew from the wood .
she rose to her feet , swaying slightly , she turned to the door . and [female] could hear her sobbing as she left him . not until the silken flap of the tent had fallen behind jeanne did power of movement and speech return to [male] . he called her name and straggled to a sitting posture . then he staggered to his feet , he could scarcely stand .
why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness ? puerile they may be ; but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to saint [male] d'assisi and of [male] aurelius . one day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant . thus lived this just man , sometimes he fell asleep in his garden . and then there was nothing more venerable possible , in 1815 , as we think we have already said .
[female] tremouille reflected for an instant . then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal , he agreed to it . both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay . the latter , on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him , endeavored to raise himself up in his bed . but he was too weak , and exhausted by the effort , he fell back again almost senseless .
but , the greatest event of all , in the new life of mr and mrs [female] . was a visit from mr and mrs [female] . sadly wan and worn was the once gallant [male] , and walked resting on his wife 's arm . and leaning heavily upon a stick , but , he was daily growing stronger and better . and it was declared by the medical attendants that he might not be much disfigured by and by .
mrs. [female] , the name still rang in my ears . as if the housekeeper had only that moment surprised me by uttering it . while we were attending to the dog , the words of [female] caution to me returned to my memory . if ever [female] crosses your path . make better use of the opportunity , miss [female] .
all , now , this is the position : one was of low condition , the other a patrician . a many years ago , but , oh , bitter is my cup ! however could i do it ? i mixed those children up , and not a creature knew it , all . however could you do it ? some day . no doubt , you will rue it .
in the absence of any precise idea as to what railways were . public opinion in [female] was against them . for the human mind in that grassy corner had not the proverbial tendency to admire the unknown . holding rather that it was likely to be against the poor man , and that suspicion was the only wise attitude with regard to it . even the rumor of reform had not yet excited any millennial expectations in [male] .
`` no less , i trust , '' said i . `` for he pays me nothing . '' indeed , at this time i held no office save the honorary position of chamberlain to her majesty . any advice the king needed from me was asked and given unofficially . [male] went off , persuaded that he had scored a point against me .
one of her reasons for engaging patricia , for really mrs. [female] was responsible for the engagement . had been that she had decided that patricia was indifferent to men . and she decided that mr. [male] might safely be trusted with patricia brent for long periods of secretarial communion . mr. [male] , although not lacking in susceptibility . was entirely devoid of that courage which subjugates the feminine heart , once he had permitted his hand to rest upon patricia 's .
[female] did not answer , her eyes had been fixed in a rigid stare on the hind quarters of the horse . which were steaming in the light of the lamps , [female] lifted her down as he had lifted her up . then mrs. [female] took her by the hand , and saying , mind the step . ma'am -- this way , ma'am , led her through the gate and along the garden path .
off went mrs. [female] rather unwillingly ; for there were several things she had wanted to speak about . and she had not heard half of what she had expected to learn of the family gossip . but all chance was gone ; for when she came back from her fruitless errand . lady cumnor and the duchess were in full talk . lady cumnor with the missing letter in her hand .
there was no such misfortune , or at any rate no such discomfort . she further reasoned , as to be formed at once for being and for seeing . you always saw , in this case , something else than what you were . and you got , in consequence , none of the [female] of your condition . however , as she never really let [female] see what she was .
her manner was subdued , it was not the annoyed manner that one uses to a man when he has behaved ill . it was the explanatory tone one might adopt towards an incorrigible child . loder felt this ; but the gist of a remark always came to him first . its mode of expression later , the fact that it was [male] whom he had encountered . [male] to whom he had spoken with vague politeness .
after hearing , in a mist through which mr inspector [male] vague and large . that the officer took upon himself to prepare the dead man 's daughter for what had befallen in the night . and generally that he took everything upon himself . [male] lightwood stumbled in his sleep to a cab stand . called a cab , and had entered the army and committed a capital military offence and been tried by court martial and found guilty and had arranged his affairs and been marched out to be shot .
they spent two evenings getting an exact definition . the slicker was good-looking or clean looking ; he had brains . social brains , that is , and he used all means on the broad path of honesty to get ahead . be popular , admired , and never in trouble , he dressed well , was particularly neat in appearance . and derived his name from the fact that his hair was inevitably worn short .
up to this time there had been no reconciliation between the [male] and his younger daughter . carry would ask her father whether she should do this or that . and the [female] would answer her as a surly master will answer a servant whom he does not like . but the father , as a father , had never spoken to the child . nor , up to this moment , had he said a word even to his wife of his intended journey to salisbury .
the place of honour at the top of the table at the colmar inn was not in these days assumed by madame faragon . she had , alas , become too stout to do so with either [female] or comfort . and always took her meals , as she always lived . in the little room downstairs , from which she could see . through the apertures of two doors , all who came in and all who went out by the chief entrance of the hotel .
in the autumn , mr. [male] of durnmelling resolved to give a harvest home to his tenants . and under the protection of the occasion to invite also a good many of his neighbors and of the townsfolk of testbridge . whom he could not well ask to dinner : there happened to be a political expediency for something of the sort . [male] is not the only country in which ambition opens the door to mean doings on the part of such as count themselves gentlemen . not a few on whom lady [female] had never called , and whom she would never in any way acknowledge again , were invited .
some persons may have noticed how extraordinarily the striking of quarters seems to quicken the flight of time . it was hardly credible that the [male] had not got wrong with the minutes when the rattle began again . the puppet emerged , and the four quarters were struck fitfully as before , one could almost be positive that there was a malicious leer upon the hideous creature 's face . and a mischievous delight in its twitchings , then followed the dull and remote resonance of the twelve heavy strokes in the tower above . the women were impressed , and there was no giggle this time .
it was quite dark upon that wintry afternoon when the omnibus stopped at the cock at graybridge . and then there was more bumping about of the luggage before [female] was handed out upon the pavement to walk home with her husband , yes . they were to walk home , what was the use of a ten pound note spent upon splendour in [location] . when the honeymoon was to close in degradation such as this ? they walked home . the streets were [male] , and there was mud in the lane where [male] 's house stood .
as he stood before the fire , thinking how best he might do this . it occurred to him that a letter from a distance would have been the ready and simple way . but then it had occurred to him also , when at a distance . that a declaration of his purpose face to face was the simplest and readiest way . if you have to go headlong into the water you should take your plunge without hesitating .
the whole thing was too depressing for me to care to watch further , so i strolled aft and climbed the poop . in the lee of the chart house captain west and the pilot were pacing slowly up and down . passing on aft , i saw steering at the wheel the weazened little old man i had noted earlier in the day . in the light of the binnacle his small blue eyes looked more malevolent than ever . so weazened and tiny was he , and so large was the brass studded wheel , that they seemed of a height .
early as it was , the main street was no place for any but formal greetings . and archer longed to be alone with may , and to pour out all his tenderness and his impatience . it still lacked an hour to the late welland breakfast time . and instead of asking him to come in she proposed that they should walk out to an old orange garden beyond the town . she had just been for a row on the river .
mechanically [male] walked with the two older men , filled with a strange sinking of the heart . and at the same time with a vague elation , was he called home by his mother to help her sustain a new calamity ? had the impossible happened ? mr. [male] 's manner continued to be mysteriously deferential toward him . and something in his air reminded [male] of england and the atmosphere of his uncle 's stately home . had he ever seen the man before ? he really did not know .
she hesitated a moment , i think this manner would be [female] , ', she said . and she continued to let him feel the value of his support . so he walked with her through the devious ways of the west side of the town . and through the bustle of gathering nightfall in populous streets . to the quiet precinct of [location] , they lingered a moment at the foot of [female] sloper 's white marble steps .
[female] would have managed pretty well if it had not been for the dining room lunch . miss [female] was expecting some friends to play tennis with her . and , besides the roast chicken , there were the cotelettes à [female] soubise and a curry . there was for dessert a jelly and a blancmange , and [female] did not know where any of the things were . and a great deal of time was wasted , do not you move .
this child , with his innocent outlook upon life . was the compass that showed them the point to which they had departed from what they knew . but did not want to know , this time seryozha was not at home . and she was completely alone , she was sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son . who had gone out for his walk and been caught in the rain , she had sent a manservant and a maid out to look for him .
and gradually they all fell asleep , while thryng sat long before the fire and pondered until cassandra slept . once and again a deep quivering sigh trembled through her parted lips . as he watched beside her , a warm rose hue played over her still features . cast by the dancing red flames . and her hair in a dishevelled mass swept across the pillow and down to the floor .
all the joy of work , the sweetness of success . the dreams of greatness , the [male] flushes of love . and then -- the tortures of conscience , the visions . the horror , the secret shame , the self abandonment . and , last of all , the twofold existence as of husband with wife .
with much fumbling he succeeded at last in turning the key and drawing the bolt . and then he found himself at liberty in the street . before he even spoke a word to the policeman he went out into the road and looked up at the window . he could just see the figure of the dragon 's helmet as she was closing the shutters . it was the last he ever saw of lady demolines or of her daughter .
there was a marked emphasis on the word friend in this sentence . but mr. [male] only bowed his reply , and presently [male] returned . ushering in a short , stout man , dressed in a rough working suit . twirling his hat in his hand , and looking extremely embarrassed and out of place in the elegant parlor . mr. [male] turned toward him immediately .
the temptation to see what was hidden overcame him . and he turned the frame over , then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure . an hour had passed when he heard a low tap at the door . and [male] came in , in that time the half breed had undergone a transformation . he was dressed in an exquisite coat of [male] .
the landscape confronting the window might , indeed , have been part of the identical stretch of country which the youthful chatterton had in his mind . in this room sat she who had been the maiden [female] till the finger of fate touched her and turned her to a wife . it was two months after the wedding . and she was alone , [female] had walked out to see the abbey by the light of sunset . but she had been too fatigued to accompany him , they had reached the last stage of a long eight weeks
he found himself before the church of the scalzi . and pushing open the leathern door wandered up the nave under the whirl of rose and lemon angels in [male] 's great vault . it was not a church in which one was likely to run across sight seers . but he presently remarked a young lady standing alone near the choir . and assiduously applying her field glass to the celestial vortex , from which she occasionally glanced down at an open manual .
breakfast at that early hour seemed odd , and even [female] 's familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on . the big trunk stood ready in the hall , mother 's cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa . and mother herself sat trying to eat , but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution . meg 's eyes kept filling in spite of herself . jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once .
even the nearest village , a huddled collection of low adobe houses and wooden shacks on the rio grande ( `` furious river , '' as the indians called it ) , was ten miles distant . only the river was near , as the word `` near '' is used in that land of vast spaces . at night , if a great wind blew . [female] fancied she could hear the voice of the rushing water .
people are beginning to grumble about their meals , which at first seemed to them miracles of culinary art . `` same old desert things we have been eating ever since [male] , '' i heard [male] , and sir [male] is sick of [male] . i suppose he means hard-boiled , i should like to feed him on soft shell scarabs ! tea is the only incident in the desert which has palled on no one yet .
the squire was in great spirits , having just accomplished a purchase of land which was worth ten times what he gave for it . and this he did by a [male] trick upon old sir [male] . who never supposed him to be in earnest , as not possessing the money . the whole thing was done on a bumper of claret in a tavern where they met . and the old knight having once pledged his word , no lawyers could hold him back from it .
at the [organization] station miss mackenzie was met by her other lover , mr [organization] . mr [organization] , however , had never yet declared himself as holding this position . and did not do so on the present occasion , their conversation in the cab was wholly concerning her brother 's state . or nearly so , it seemed that there was no hope , mr [organization] said that very clearly . as to time the doctor would say nothing certain .
carlton , knew better than to move it when he found it there . he had learned to study his master since he had joined him in [location] . and understood that one photograph in the silver frame was entitled to more consideration than three others on the writing desk or half a dozen on the mantel piece . nolan had seen them come and go ; he had watched them rise and fall . he had carried notes to them .
mrs. [female] strictly obeyed the doctor 's injunctions . a girl of seventeen , the daughter of a small tenant farmer near the towers . had been a special favourite with [female] , who was not apt to make friends amongst strangers . this girl , [female] pollard . was sent for , and came willingly and gladly to watch her young patroness , she brought her needlework with her .
he is all joy , he will destroy our bonds . i can not but feel , again and again , that there are two persons in me . one recoils from [male] in his terrible aspect of chaos . the other feels that very vision to be sweetly alluring , the sinking ship drags down all who are swimming round it . [male] is just such a force of destruction .
but my proceedings , dear chrysale , have at least the merit of not binding [male] personally . i know that love has its illusions . and every illusion its tomorrow , that is why there are so many partings among lovers vowed to each other for life . the proof of love lies in two things . suffering and happiness , when , after passing through these double trials of life two beings have shown each other their defects as well as their good qualities .
these words of sandip echo in my heart beats like a war drum . they shame into silence all my conflicts with myself . what do i care what people may think of me ? of what value are that orchid and that niche in my bedroom ? what power have they to belittle me . to put me to shame ? the primal fire of creation burns in me .
thinking to myself that they would be more likely indeed to keep quiet about it . they had other things to talk of , and then remembering little fyne stuck upstairs for an unconscionable time . enough to blurt out everything he ever knew in his life . i reflected that he would assume naturally that captain [male] had nothing to learn from him about [male] barral . it had been up to now my assumption too , i saw my mistake .
do not tell me , i know what men are , i have seen the world . i have been looking at things with my eyes open . i knew what he was doing , and then he would tell of the sly deed of some official known well to them both . not denouncing it by any means , but affecting to take it for granted that the man in question was a rogue . [organization] would shrug his shoulders , and laugh gently , and say that , upon his word .
on the wednesday [female] was engaged to dine with mr. [male] , there was a dinner party in bedford square . and [male] met half a dozen barristers and their wives . men to whom he had looked up as successful pundits in the law some five or six years ago . but who since that time had almost learned to look up to him , and now they treated him with that courteousness of manner which success in life always begets . there was a judge there who was very civil to him ; and the judge 's wife whom he had taken down to dinner was very gracious to him .
but olivia [female] did not mean to be unmerciful ; she meant to be good to her stepdaughter . she did not love her ; but , on the other hand , she did not dislike her . her feelings were simply negative , [female] understood this . and the submissive obedience she rendered to her stepmother was untempered by affection . so for nearly two years these two people led a monotonous life .
`` send me some brandy , '' returned sir [male] . without deigning to make any further reply to the landlord 's apologetic speech . he followed the girl , who led the way to a door at the end of a passage . which she opened , and ushered sir [female] into a light and comfortable room . before a large , old-fashioned fire place sat a man , with his face hidden by the newspaper which he was reading .
[male] 's steed had answered every expectation . and proved himself very quiet ; so quiet , that without the admonition of a cudgel behind him . he could hardly be persuaded into the demurest trot , now , as sir [male] 's horse was of a very different mettle . he found it rather difficult not to step faster than his inamorata . and , let it him struggle as he would .
often , at some one 's suggestion of a new idea , we ran off to explore the house again in search of the key to the glenarm riddle . and always we came back to the library with that riddle still unsolved . bates had been into annandale to mail some letters , and i was staring out upon the park from the library windows when he entered . stoddard , having kept watch the night before , was at home asleep . and [male] was off somewhere in the house , treasure hunting , i was feeling decidedly discouraged over our failure to make any progress with our investigations , and bates
even as i looked a bursting sea filled the runway between the house and rail . and through the doorway in which i stood the freezing water rushed waist deep . i had to hold on to escape being swept inside the room , from a top bunk . lying on his side , andy fay regarded me steadily with his bitter blue eyes . seated on the rough table of heavy planks , his sea booted feet swinging in the water .
let the boys be boys , the longer the better , and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must . but mothers , sisters , and friends may help to make the crop a small one . and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest , by believing , and showing that they believe . in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest in good women 's eyes . if it is a feminine delusion , leave [female] to enjoy it while we may .
because [male] had danced with the well-built , soft youth , his companion . loerke , was more pettish and exasperated than ever , and would not even notice her existence in the room . this piqued her , but she made up to herself by dancing with the professor . who was strong as a mature , well seasoned bull , and as full of coarse energy . she could not bear him , critically , and yet she enjoyed being rushed through the dance .
nearly two months were passed ; and as yet no opportunity had been given to the prisoner 's wife to visit him . and during that time it had been impossible to go back into the hills and leave the girl alone . the heat of the summer had been stifling , down here in the valley . a huge plague of grasshoppers had ravaged all england . and there were times when even in the grass country outside derby .
[female] was left alone , stark saw her fight the rearing beast she rode and then flung herself out of the saddle and let it go . she came toward him , running , clad all in her [male] armor . the great axe swinging high , he turned then and saw them . coming out from the tower of stone , the pale . shining creatures that move so swiftly across the ice , so fleet and swift that no man living could outrun them .
so hughie arranged it all , and for an hour the singing went on . the favorite hymns of each being sung in turn , for the most part . mrs. [female] sat silent , but now and then she would join with the others . singing alto when she did so , by hughie 's special direction . her voice was not strong , but it was true , mellow , and full of music .
against the moonlit screen of the universe clung the [male] tower of that faraway monastery in the clouds . the home of the monks of saint [male] . out of the world , above the world , a part of the sky itself . it stood like the spectre of a sentinel whose ghostly guardian ship appalled and yet soothed . they were not twenty feet apart , he advanced to her side .
i would watched the sorrow of the evening sky . and smelt the sea , and earth , and the warm clover . and heard the waves , and the seagull 's mocking cry . and in them all was only the old cry , that song they always sing . the best is over , you may remember now , and think , and sigh .
though it was evidently in the grain of his character . and of his respect for his own case , that he should abstain from idle murmuring . it was evident that he had grown the older , the sterner . and the poorer , for his long endeavour , he could not but think what a blessed thing it would have been for this man . if he had taken a lesson from the gentlemen who were so kind as to take a nation 's affairs in charge .
he was clothed all in steel , in the beautifulest armor of the time . up to where his helmet ought to have been ; but he had not any helmet . he wore a shiny stove pipe hat , and was ridiculous a spectacle as one might want to see . it was another of my surreptitious schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it grotesque and absurd . sir [male] 's saddle was hung about with leather hat boxes .
as he dreamed , he turned round . and his eyes fell upon the brass knob of the door which separated him from the court of assizes . he had almost forgotten that door , his glance . calm at first , paused there , remained fixed on that brass handle . then grew terrified , and little by little became impregnated with fear , beads of perspiration burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples .
[female] repeated his assurances , but a sense of disappointment had come over him as [male] had been speaking . the adventure was not panning out as he had hoped , at the same time . he told himself that he would be paid for his services . perhaps liberally , and it might prevent him having to touch the little nest egg in the post office savings bank . when [male] parted with his late employer and left the grill room it was with the key of adderbury cottage .
this dialogue made [female] all uneasy , and me very uneasy . the dismal wind was muttering round the house , the tide was flapping at the shore . and i had a feeling that we were caged and threatened . a four oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that i could not get rid of . when i had induced provis to go up to bed .
`` i do not blame you , '' the brother rejoined . and then no more had been said between them , before [male] left the house . after the reading of the will , he again invited his sister to his own home . an hour or two had intervened since he had told her of her position in the world . and he was astonished at finding how composed and self assured she was in the tone and manner of her answer .
here the corner was torn off , and whether that was the end of the original sentence or not . it was the end to him . god sometimes uses very simple means with which to confound the wisdom of this world . such a sudden and extraordinary revulsion of feeling as swept over [male] he had never dreamed of before . he did not stop to question the strangeness of his state of mind .
the doctor explained away what he said as well as he could . he could not explain that what he had really meant was this , that sir [male] son was not a man fit to be trusted with the entire control of an enormous fortune , yes . he was christened [male] , after the king of the french . if one wishes to look out in the world for royal nomenclature , to find children who have been christened after kings and queens . or the uncles and aunts of kings and queens .
`` well , write her about it , '' he recommended , his eyes travelling on in search of the weather report . he had turned to the wrong page ; and suddenly a line of [male] characters leapt out at him as from an ambush . he had not known that it would be like this , after the first odious weeks . spent in preparing the letters for publication , in submitting them to flamel . and in negotiating with the publishers , the transaction had dropped out of his consciousness into that unvisited limbo to which we relegate the deeds we would rather not have done but have no notion of undoing .
there was only one room in the sycamores which was never tenanted by any one of that little household except [male] himself . who kept the key of the little chamber in his writing desk . and only allowed the servants to go in at stated intervals to keep everything bright and orderly in the apartment . the shut up chamber was the boudoir which [male] arundel had planned for his first wife . he had ordered it to be furnished with the very furniture which he had intended for [male] .
she had laughed in pure joy at his praise of her . for every bantering phrase had then been a caress . but now the words returned with a sinister meaning . she knew they were true as far as amherst was concerned . in the arts of casuistry and equivocation a child could have outmatched him .
the postscript , expressed in these terms , was shown to miss [female] when she arrived at limmeridge . there were also placed in her possession the clothes lady [female] had worn . and the other effects she had brought with her to her aunt 's house . they had been carefully collected and sent to [location] by madame [female] . such was the posture of affairs when miss [female] reached limmeridge in the early part of september .
this suffices me , my brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me . i understand him without his speaking , and we abandon ourselves to the care of providence . that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul . i have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the faux family . you are aware that he knows everything .
it so departed from type that it possessed a small but undeniable bath room . besides this miracle , there was a cosy sitting room , a larger bedroom on the floor above and next to this an empty room facing north . which had evidently served artist occupants as a studio , the remainder of the ground floor was taken up by kitchen and scullery . the furniture had been constructed by somebody who would probably have done very well if he had taken up some other line of industry . but it was mitigated by a very fine and comfortable wicker easy chair .
the trip home did bring another week with mrs. [female] . for after mature consideration she had decided to venture to [female] for a while . [location] and [location] were her destinations . and she hoped to see more of [female] , her presence was a good deal of a surprise to [female] . and it started her thinking again , she could see what the point was .
he turned the man about and rushed him toward the house . the revolver still serving as a prod , his speed gave heart to the wary invaders immediately behind him and two fellows urged and led by [male] charged our line at a smart pace . `` bolt for the front door , '' i called to [male] . and stoddard and i closed in after him to guard his retreat . we were now nearing the edge of the wood .
but much as he wished to be an exemplar in these things he could not get on . it was quite impossible , he found , to ask to be delivered from temptation when your heart 's desire was to be tempted unto seventy times seven . so he excused himself , `` after all , '' he said . it is not altogether an erotolepsy that is the matter with me . as at that first time , i can see that she is exceptionally bright .
some little compact on matters of business must have been arranged between them . for the captain was in funds again , he was in funds again through the liberality of his friend . and no payment of former loans had been made , nor had there been any speech of such . mr [organization] had drawn his purse strings liberally . and had declared that if all went well the hospitality of oileymead should not be wanting during the winter .
he exchanged a few words with his men . motioned to me that i would ride behind one of them . and then mounted his own animal , the fellow designated reached down two or three hands and lifted me up behind him on the glossy back of his mount . where i hung on as best i could by the belts and straps which held the martian 's weapons and ornaments . the entire cavalcade then turned and galloped away toward the range of hills in the distance .
`` you juggling villain , '' said the baronet . in whom these expressions awakened a suspicion that overcame his terrors . connected as it was with the sense of desperation arising from the apprehension of impending ruin -- you juggling mountebank , this is some legerdemain trick of yours to get off from the performance of your promise . as you have so often done before , but , before heaven , i will this night know what i have trusted to when i suffered you to fool me on to my ruin !
i quite understand that in education and habits of thinking you are my superior . but nobody can love you better than i do , i sometimes fancy that nobody could ever love you so well . [female] thinks that i ought to allow a time to go by before i say all this again . but what is the use of keeping it back ? it seems to me to be more honest to tell you at once that the only thing in the world for which i care one straw is that you should be my wife . `` miss [female] is coming here , to the castle , in a fortnight , ''
as time went on i found the points of superiority to decrease . those of inferiority rapidly to increase , i troubled myself little about them and their opinions . my joys and griefs , hopes and fears . lay so entirely outside their circle that i scarce noticed whether they noticed me or not . i felt and behaved coldly toward them , to the women because their voices never had the ring of genuine liking in speaking to me .
the russian army , only half the strength of the french , does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month . [male] 's position is most brilliant , he can either fall on the russian army with double its strength and destroy it . negotiate an advantageous [male] , or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on petersburg . or even , in the case of a reverse , return to smolensk or vilna . or remain in [location] ; in short , no special genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position the french held at that time .
all night i steered , without relief . the wind slowly and steadily increasing and the sea rising , at five in the morning maud brought me hot coffee and biscuits she had baked . and at seven a substantial and piping hot breakfast put new lift into me . but i had not reckoned upon the colossal task the reefing of three sails meant for one man . while running away from the wind i had not appreciated its force .
`` it 's just as i wish it , mrs. [female] , '' she said , in a low key of impassioned resolution . `` now , my conscience is at rest , and you have done this for me , mrs , [female] ! '' she stood timidly with the door in her hand . watching mrs. [female] 's slight smile .
so there were made letters in the pleasantest wise , according to king [male] 's desire . and ulfius and brastias , the messengers , rode forth well horsed and well armed . and so passed the sea and came to the city of benwick . here they had good cheer as long as they tarried . and received the answer that king ban and king [male] would come unto king [male] in all the haste they might .
he desired the punishment to be as full as he could make it . not content to kill the marquis as the marquis had killed [male] . he desired that he should first know himself as powerless to avert that death as [male] had been . nothing less would content andre louis , [male] le marquis must begin by tasting of that cup of despair . it was in the account ; part of the quittance due .
she would have none of surreptitious bliss . she began by declaring ; and she set forth her reasons with her usual lucid impartiality . in the first place , she should have to marry some day . and when she made the bargain she meant it to be an honest one . and secondly , in the matter of love , she would never give herself to anyone she did not really care for .
mr. [male] did consent to both propositions . and when the deputation withdrew , he felt himself to be himself once more . his courage had returned to him , and he would at once rebuke his wife for the impropriety of the words she had addressed to him . he would rebuke his wife , and would then proceed to meet mr. [female] the attorney . at the dragon , and to take the chair at the meeting .
the verdict had been pronounced : dislocation and fracture of the fourth vertebra . with consequent injury to the spinal cord , [female] and wyant came out alone to tell her . the surgeon ran over the technical details , her brain instantly at attention as he developed his diagnosis and issued his orders . she asked no questions as to the future . she knew it was impossible to tell , but there were no immediate signs of a fatal ending .
one comes out of prison in the same clothes one wore on the day of condemnation . no matter how long one has been put away there , oh , they last , they last ! but there is something which is preserved by prison life even better than one 's discarded clothing . it is the force , the vividness of one 's sentiments . a monastery will do that too ; but in the unholy claustration of a jail you are thrown back wholly upon yourself .
he took his way to her hotel on a bright day with a feeling such as he had often had going to visit an adored picture . no woman , so far as he remembered , had ever inspired in him this special sensuous and yet impersonal sensation . he was going to sit and feast his eyes , and come away knowing her no better . but ready to go and feast his eyes again tomorrow , such was his feeling . when in the tarnished and ornate little lounge of a quiet hotel near the river she came to him preceded by a small page boy who uttered the word .
reaching away from him , miles upon miles of it . east , west and south -- was a dead and char stricken world , up to the foot of the ridge itself had come the devastation of flame . and where it had swept , months ago , there was now no sign of the glorious spring that lay behind him . he looked for the timber on sucker creek where the little old missioner 's cabin lay . and where he had dreamed that nada would be waiting for him .
`` let it go on , '' he said to himself . as he took up his cap and stick . and went off to the woods , let it go on , if she finds today that she can not take him . i will never say another word to press her . he went up to the woods after breakfast .
she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration . that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance , and yet . she could not help rather anticipating something decisive , she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis . an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state . he was in high spirits ; as ready to talk and laugh as ever .
the murmur of the city , the chatter of the club . are hundreds of miles away , we rode downward under the towering trees . and dismounting , saw a little houseboat tethered to the bank . it was not of the richer sort that haunts the bund . where the native servants follow in a separate boat , and even the electric light is turned on as part of the luxury .
he alluded , of course , to lord fawn . and poor lord fawn , sitting up there on the seat of honour . visible to all the world , became very hot and very uncomfortable , then there arose a vehement dispute between sir gregory . assisted by sir [male] , and old mr. [male] . who rejected with disdain any assistance from the gentler men who were with him .
the clouds were gathering over [male] , too -- deep and dark , but of altogether another kind from those that enveloped [male] . no troubles are for one moment to be compared with those that come of the wrongness . even if it be not wickedness , that is our own , some clouds rise from stagnant bogs and fens . others from the wide , clean , large ocean , but either kind . thank god , will serve the angels to come down by .
his mind once made up , he had not to wait long for an opportunity . he was now quite recovered from his hurts , and accustomed to walk in the neighbourhood of the kraal . about two hundred yards from umgona 's huts rose a spring . and thither it was nanea 's habit to resort in the evening to bring back drinking water for the use of her father 's household . the path between this spring and the kraal ran through a patch of [male] .
`` tuesday week , '' said gradman , `` life or lives in bein '' and twenty one years afterward -- it 's a long way off . but i am glad he 's left it in the family ... just as he passed the seat of custom on his return to the outer air he met with a contingency which had not been entirely absent from his mind when he went into the gallery . [female] , herself , coming in , so she had not gone yet .
there came nothing to change the situation -- no new elements in the sketch . only a recurrence which engraved it , the may weeks went on into june . and still mrs. [female] was outwardly in the same place , presenting herself as she was expected to do in the accustomed scenes . with the accustomed [female] , beauty , and costume . from church at one end of the week .
the gypsy 's corsage slipped through his hands like the skin of an eel . she bounded from one end of the tiny room to the other . stooped down , and raised herself again , with a little poniard in her hand . before gringoire had even had time to see whence the poniard came . proud and angry , with swelling lips and inflated nostrils .
she was beautiful , and , from the point of view of figure . more beautiful than marguerite , i realized this fact still more clearly from certain glances which marguerite bestowed upon her while i was talking with her . the man who was the lover of such a woman might well be as proud as [female] . and she was beautiful enough to inspire a passion not less great than that which marguerite had inspired in me . at that moment she had no lover .
`` himself , he 's coming along to pay his respects . '' and as he finished these words the ex clerk of yonville entered the box . he held out his hand with the ease of a gentleman . and madame bovary extended hers , without doubt obeying the attraction of a stronger will . she had not felt it since that spring evening when the rain fell upon the green leaves .
as a set off against such discussions as these there had come an improvement in their pecuniary position . which earlier in their experience would have made them cheerful , jude had quite unexpectedly found good employment at his old trade almost directly he arrived . the summer weather suiting his fragile constitution . and outwardly his days went on with that monotonous uniformity which is in itself so grateful after vicissitude . people seemed to have forgotten that he had ever shown any awkward aberrancies .
in his execution of this mission , mr [male] perhaps expressed that mr [male] was in a raging fume . however that was , mrs general 's skirts were very speedily heard outside , coming along . one might almost have said bouncing along . with unusual expedition , albeit , they settled down at the door and swept into the room with their customary coolness . mrs general , with a graceful curve of acknowledgment , descended into the chair which mr [female] offered .
she turned a little away from him when she had ended this sentence . as if it had comprised all she could possibly have to say to him . but he exclaimed , `` you wo not know how to choose , '' and , seating himself on the counter . he swung himself over after the fashion of shop men . [male] took no notice of him .
at last i got to my [organization] ( as i had begun to call it ) . although i never should have known it but for what it looked on , and even to know this last again required all the eyes of love . soever sharp and vigilant , for all the beautiful glen doone ( shaped from out the mountains . as if on purpose for the doones , and looking in the summer time like a sharp cut vase of green ) . now was besnowed half up the sides , and at either end so .
lionel paid him the price agreed and dismissed him upon receiving the assurance that the swallow would put to sea upon the next tide . when it became known that sir [male] had been in treaty with master [male] for a passage overseas . and that it was but on that account that master [male] had tarried in that haven . even [male] began to doubt , gradually [male] recovered his tranquillity as the days flowed on . what was done was done , and , in any case , being now beyond recall .
but apropos of this latter boon , it is dawning upon me that [male] guest is receiving more attention than [male] . this strikes me as inexplicable , there are more men than women in our party . all young except sir [male] , general harlow , and mills of manchester . a soft , fat sort of fellow whose first name you can never remember . it occurred to me on starting , that the desire of so many unattached young men to spend a week in the desert and the fayoum .
having thus acquired learning , a man , with the wealth that he may have gained by gift . conquest , purchase , deposit , or inheritance from his ancestors . should become a householder , and pass the life of a citizen . he should take a house in a city . or large village , or in the vicinity of good men .
it was impossible for archer to discuss the necessity of may 's accompanying her father . the reputation of the mingotts family physician was largely based on the attack of pneumonia which mr. [male] had never had . and his insistence onaugustine was therefore inflexible , originally , it had been intended that may 's engagement should not be announced till her return from [location] . and the fact that it had been made known sooner could not be expected to alter mr. [male] 's plans . archer would have liked to join the travellers and have a few weeks of [male] and boating with his betrothed .
with such a mental habit a man could not help but wince at [male] . i drank my tea very slowly because i previsioned what must happen in the next five minutes . down there by the pond he would turn at the sound of those heavy boots on the path . and with one glance he would assess the age of her . the rubbed surface of her , the torn fine texture .
in the tavern , before which stood the doctor 's covered cart . there were already some five officers , [female] , a plump little blonde german . in a dressing jacket and nightcap . was sitting on a broad bench in the front corner . her husband , the doctor , lay asleep behind her .
dr. braithwaite came twice during the week to see us . each time making a hurried call , [male] appeared to wish to impress [male] with the importance of these visits from so busy and distinguished a man . but the noted surgeon himself was simple and unaffected in his manner . one thing troubled me , i had done nothing . said nothing to further miss sonnot 's desire to go to [location] as a nurse .
it was true that she had heard [female] colborne talked of amongst her church going acquaintance at graybridge . but it was quite untrue that she had ever felt the faintest desire to hear him preach . had not her whole life been bounded by a magic circle , of which [male] lansdell was the resplendent centre ? he could not go away , in vain , in vain he wrestled with himself . most bitterly did he despise and hate himself for his unmanly weakness .
still , i could not be sure that a slight gust of wind had not shaken them . but i was so convinced that i had heard close to me a real human laugh . or sound of some living creature that exactly simulated a laugh . that i carefully searched the ground about me , expecting to find a being of some kind . but i found nothing , and going back to my seat on the hanging branch .
a splendid marriage which presented itself within reach had shown a hideous flaw . the chances of roulette had not adjusted themselves to her claims . and a man of whom she knew nothing had thrust himself between her and her intentions . the conduct of those uninteresting people who managed the business of the world had been culpable just in the points most injurious to her in particular . [female] , with all her beauty and conscious force .
if my enemies had come on me then disposed to kill me . i could not have lifted a hand in defence of my life . but minutes passed and they came not , i rose and went on . at a fast walk now , and when the sheltering streamed ended , i stooped among the sere dwarfed shrubs scattered about here and there on its southern side . and now creeping and now running , with an occasional pause to rest and look back .
even his steed seemed to tread less lightly and blithely to the trumpet sound than the noble arab which was bestrode by sir [male] . and the spruch sprecher shook his head while he observed that . while the challenger rode around the lists in the course of the sun . that is , from right to left -- the defender made the same circuit widdersins . that is , from left to right -- which is in most countries held ominous .
being also quite aware how it would trouble her . he would again postpone , and thus another week passed away , [female] could not contest this belief of her lover 's . and remained silent ; but there had more than once occurred to her mind a doubt of its probability . yet she had only abandoned her opinion that [female] had schemed for [male] . to embrace the opposite error ; that , finding he had wronged the young lady .
i reached into a trunk that stood just beside me and took out a box that i had not looked into for years . his letters were all there , and his photographs , that were very handsome , i could hardly see them through my tears . but i knew that they were dim in places with being cried over when i had put them away years ago after aunt adeline decided that i was to be married . i kissed the poor little girl cry spots ; and with that a perfect flood of tears rose to my eyes . but they did not fall , for there , right in front of me .
papa offers to go to ramsgate for a fortnight . but he looks so wretched when he makes the offer . that i shall not have the heart to hold him to it . lady macleod very much wants me to go to cheltenham , i very much want not to go . simply because i can never agree with her about anything .
major grantly was as intimately acquainted with miss [female] as a man under thirty may well be with a lady nearer fifty than forty . who is not specially connected with him by any family tie . but of [male] he knew personally very much less , [male] , as has before been said . did not go out , and was therefore not common to the eyes of the silverbridgians . she did occasionally see her friends in her own house .
`` very provoking : it spoils the set , '' murmured [female] to herself . mournfully absorbed over the ruins of the broken cup , while these words were being spoken . [male] , happily and fussily unconscious of the irreparable wrong which the crockery had suffered at his hands . was dragging a large arm chair to the opposite end of the room . so as to command [male] all three , in the character of a public speaker addressing an audience .
she reached the gate and leaned over it . and as she did so someone in the shadow of a tall tree spoke her name . a man came into the light , and she saw that it was lord dawlish . lord dawlish had gone for a moonlight walk that night because . like claire , he wished to be alone to think , he had fallen with a [male] ease and smoothness into the rather curious life lived at [male] boyd 's bee farm .
i committed one error in trusting myself to such a blindfold calculation of chances as this . i committed another when [male] had paid the penalty of his own obstinacy and violence . by granting lady [male] a second reprieve from the mad house . and allowing mr. [male] a second chance of escaping me . in brief , [male] , at this serious crisis .
baisemeaux leaned back to ring for [female] , and by a very natural motion turned round towards the door . the order had remained on the table ; [male] seized the opportunity when [male] was not looking to change the paper for another . folded in the same manner , which he drew swiftly from his pocket . [male] , said the governor , let the [male] come up here with the turnkeys of the bertaudiere . [male] bowed and quitted the room , leaving the two companions alone .
gilbert fancied that mrs. [female] was by no means too favourably disposed towards [female] . she had sharp [female] eyes . very much like the jet beads with which her person was decorated . and with these she kept a close watch upon mrs. [male] and mr. [male] when the two were talking together . [female] saw how great an effort it cost her at these times to keep up the commonplace conversation which he had commenced with her .
in this manner the horse came bearing him home at sunrise . [male] was away on his beat , not uneasy over [male] 's absence . it was the exception for him to spend a night in the bunkhouse in that summer weather . so old [male] , jaded , scorched , bloody from his own and his master 's wounds . was obliged to stand at the gate and whinny for help when he arrived .
after a few minutes the worst suffering abated , and he sat down again in his chair . i got some water ; he drank . and let me bathe his face with it . his face , grey and death like . [male] 's face , a few heavy sighs .
lord belpher , meanwhile , in the library . had begun with the aid of a whisky and soda to feel a little better . there was something about the library with its sombre half tones that soothed his bruised spirit . the room held something of the [male] of a deserted city . the world , with its violent adventures and tall policemen .
[male] both disliked him , had it not been for his influence mrs. [female] felt sure her husband would never have returned to his vice . had it not been for mr. [female] mrs . [female] felt that her husband would never have taken to betting , legends and mystery had formed around mr. [male] and his pantry . and in esther 's unsophisticated mind this little room . with its tobacco smoke and glasses on the table .
alas , said the damosel , where shall i find him ? in such a place , said sir fergus , then sir fergus found queen isoud sick in her bed . making the greatest dole that ever any earthly woman made , and when the damosel found sir [female] she made great dole because she might not amend him . for the more she made of him the more was his pain . and at the last sir [male] took his horse and rode away from her .
with the letters pressed close against my tear wet cheeks i sat for a long time . busy with memories of my mother and debating whether or not i had the right to open the letter . i certainly was not in desperate straits , and i could not conscientiously say that i no longer harbored any resentment toward^the father of whom i had no recollection . i felt that never in my life could i fully pardon the man who had made my mother suffer so terribly . but the longing to know something of my father .
she liked her lover 's handwriting . it seemed to express character -- just such character as she imagined her knight 's to be . there were dash and determination , and an originality which would never let itself be bound by convention . one reason for feeling sure she could never care for the man was because his handwriting prejudiced her in advance . it was so stiff , so devoid of character , how different , she reflected now .
in [location] , as in [location] , [female] found the same atmosphere of gentleness and affection . he could not refuse the post , or rather the rank . that prince vasili had procured for him . and acquaintances , invitations , and social occupations were so numerous that . even more than in [location] , he felt a sense of bewilderment .
the charwoman soon came , her presence was at first a strain upon tess . but afterwards an alleviation , at half past twelve she left her assistant alone in the kitchen . and , returning to the sitting room , waited for the reappearance of angel 's form behind the bridge . about one he showed himself , her face flushed . although he was a quarter of a mile off .
percy had stopped and sought cover in the hedge because . as he rounded the bend in the road . he perceived , before he had time to check his gallop . that maud had also stopped , she was standing in the middle of the road . looking over her shoulder , not ten yards away , had she seen him ?
beverly and the faithful aunt [female] were driven to the castle . where the former bade farewell to her new knight until the following morning . when he was to appear before her for personal instructions , colonel quinnox escorted him to the barracks of the guards where he was to share a room with young haddan . a corporal in the service , the wild . untamed gentleman from the hills came without a word .
the next morning she looked at herself again . not by accident this time , and she was assailed with doubts . `` where did i get such an idea ? '' said she ; `` no , i am ugly . '' she had not slept well , that was all , her eyes were sunken and she was pale . she had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful .
the ridge loomed up at the edge of the level plain . and for a few moments jolly [male] paused , while he looked off through the eastward gloom . a mile in that direction , beyond the cleft that ran like a great furrow through the ridge . was jed hawkins cabin , still and dark under the faint glow of the stars . and in that cabin was nada , he felt that she was sitting at her little window .
a keener hand at scuttling a cunarder or cutting out a white star never shipped a handspike . [male] : yes , i have done my best for you , and why ? it was my duty under my indentures . and i am the slave of duty , as a child i was regularly apprenticed to your band . it was through an error -- no matter .
love is such a simple thing when we have only one and twenty summers and a sweet girl of seventeen trembles under our glance . as if she were a bud first opening her heart with wondering rapture to the morning . such young unfurrowed souls roll to meet each other like two velvet peaches that touch softly and are at rest . they mingle as easily as two brooklets that ask for nothing but to entwine themselves and ripple with ever interlacing curves in the leafiest hiding places . while [male] gazed into [male] 's dark beseeching eyes .
she looked round with a jump . and blushed , smiling and screwing up her little shoulders , when she recognised the two men who were coming towards her from the door of the lecture hall . the one who had called out was [female] mynors . morning superintendent of the sunday school and conductor of the men 's bible class held in the lecture hall on sunday afternoons . the other was [male] , usually styled willie price , secretary of the same bible class .
versailles broke the horizon to port and slipped astern . [location] closed up , telescoped its panorama , became a mere blur . a smoky smudge , but it was long before the distance eclipsed that admonitory finger of the eiffel . vauquelin manipulating the levers , the plane tilted its nose and swam higher and yet higher . the song of the motor dropped an octave to a richer tone .
from the first moment of their meeting it was noticeable that willie was strongly attracted by [male] sensitive and intelligent face . and had he not been , for [location] 's sake he would have made an effort to like the newcomer . fortunately , however , effort was unnecessary , for [male] won his way quite as uncontestedly with the little inventor as with [location] . there was no question that his aunt was delighted with him . one could read it in her affectionate touch on his arm .
the friendship existing between lady [male] and this young man was a queer . inconsistent sentiment enough , and yet was a friendship . and a mature one , the two had encountered each other some years ago , when [male] had been by no means in his palmiest days . in fact , my lady had picked him up when he stood in sore need of friends . and oglethorpe never forgot a favor , he never forgot to be grateful to lady [male] .
at least , mr [male] seemed perfectly satisfied when he descried them on board , probably . at least , [female] no sooner stepped ashore than she took mr [female] 's arm . without evincing surprise , and the two walked away together with an ethereal air of happiness which . as it were , wafted up from the earth and drew after them a [female] and glum old pensioner to see it out . two wooden legs had this [male] and glum old pensioner .
but the young man did not reply , he swung , with the same long . nervous stride , into the down river trail , until late that night the three men . for [male] insisted on accompanying them -- hurried through the forest . [male] walked tirelessly , upheld by his violent but repressed excitement . when his hat fell from his head , he either did not notice the fact .
continued abstention from speech , and constant avoidance of everything that might lead up to the subject . this halting on all sides at the boundary of what they might not mention . brought before their minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling . but pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy . princess [female] , in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew .
their eyes were upon armitage ; and in their intentness they failed to note the increasing pace of oscar 's horse . which was spurting slowly ahead , when they saw that he would first make the sweep which they assumed to be the contemplated strategy of the charging party . they leveled their arms at him . believing that he must soon check his horse , but on he rode . bending forward a little , his rifle held across the saddle in front of him .
it is not easy to imagine a lion hearted young cavalry officer . whose soldiership in the punjaub had won the praises of a napier and an outram . fainting away like a heroine of romance at the coming of evil tidings . but [male] arundel , who had risen from a sick bed to take a long and fatiguing journey in utter defiance of the doctors . was not strong enough to bear the dreadful welcome that greeted him upon the gate post at [male] towers .
he could be very jovial at dinner parties . he could make his little jokes about little pet wickednesses . a glass of wine , in season . he never refused , picnics he allowed . and the flirtation accompanying them , he himself was driven about behind a pair of horses .
so long as monseigneur held his [male] , she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom . but as soon as monseigneur began to speak , as we have seen , she obeyed passively like her [female] . mademoiselle baptistine did not even speak , she confined herself to obeying and pleasing him . she had never been pretty , even when she was young ; she had large . blue , prominent eyes , and a long arched nose ; but her whole visage .
this very exacting member of the fold appeared to be endowed with a sixth sense . in regard of knowing when the reverend [female] least desired her company . and with promptitude appearing in his little hall , consequently , when the reverend [male] had willingly engaged that he and his wife would accompany lightwood back . he said , as a matter of course . we must make haste to get out , [female] , my dear .
we shall hope to see you at matching on the 15th of august . the duke , as head of the family . expects implicit obedience , you will meet fifteen young gentlemen from the [organization] and [organization] . but they wo not incommode you , as they are kept at work all day . we hope mr. [male] will be with us .
... get her leg out , she will fall ... ah , they do not see it ! came identical shouts from the ranks all along the regiment . another time , general attention was attracted by a small brown dog . coming heaven knows whence , which trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by . when it yelped , tucked its tail between its legs .
[male] pondered for an instant in uncertainty . this shrewd man 's flattering words , the naïve . childlike affection shown her by liza merkalova . and all the social atmosphere she was used to , -- it was all so easy . and what was in store for her was so difficult , that she was for a minute in uncertainty whether to remain .
as far as person went , she answered point for point . both to my picture and mrs. [female] 's description . the noble bust , the sloping shoulders , the graceful neck . the dark eyes and [female] ringlets were all there . but her face ? her face was like her mother 's .
we did not stop at the first story , the `` show '' part of the house of the crocodile . but catching a glimpse of a latticed balcony off the landing . all lovely mushrbiyeh work , and a great room of persian tiled walls and coloured marble floor . beyond , we dashed up another flight of stairs to the story above . these stairs were of common wood , and somewhat out of repair .
`` you flatter me , '' says [male] . and they marched him off , [male] was kept a long time in a guard room . once or twice an officer came in and looked him over , but he was asked no questions . and he asked none , he was ill at ease . not , i believe , from any fear for himself , he knew .
so , controlling her tears , she rose , and clasping the child to her bosom . she bade him be of good cheer since he went with the gods . and that great saint took his hand from hers . and for the first time in the life of the queen he raised his aged eyes to her face . and she gazed at him ; but what she read .
that day at windsor [male] had all the honour and happiness that he could desire . three different joys and honours were his : one was the town which he captured . another was the present of the best kingdom in wales . which king [male] had promised to give him when the war was over . that very day he made him king in his hall .
before we reached the door of her own apartment she commanded me to stop . and she took a long , last look up and down the noble sala . `` oh , it 's a magnificent house , '' she murmured . after which i pushed her forward , when we had entered the parlor miss tita told me that she should now be able to manage . and at the same moment the little red haired donna came to meet her [female] .
`` you shall have it , of course , '' said the doctor ; `` but do not let the necessity for asking for more hundreds come oftener than you can help . '' [male] said that he would not , and then there was no further discourse about money . it need hardly be said that he told his father nothing of that bill which he had endorsed for laurence fitzgibbon . at last came the time which called him again to [location] and the glories of [location] life .
he conceived that this memory would be the extreme of his sufferings . till one sunday , the red haired girl announced that she would make a study of [male] 's head . and that he would be good enough to sit still , and -- quite as an afterthought . look at maisie , he sat . because he could not well refuse , and for the space of half an hour he reflected on all the people in the past whom he had laid open for the purposes of his own craft .
so [female] got into her white bed with the dotted swiss valance . and drew the covers to her chin , and looked a scant sixteen . aunt [female] , who was an unsentimental woman . childless and diffident , found her suddenly very appealing there in her smooth bed . and did an unexpected thing , she kissed her .
once or twice in the early morning a german plane , flying so low that one could easily see the [male] cross on each wing . reconnoitered the village for wagon trains or troops . always they found it empty , hope had almost fled now . in the afternoons [male] went to the ruined church . and there knelt before the heap of marble and masonry that had once been the altar , and prayed .
in his choice of the other two trustees he had been more prudent . the first of these , the honourable mr delvile , was a man of high birth and character . the second , mr briggs , had spent his whole life in business . in which he had already amassed an immense fortune , and had still no greater pleasure than that of encreasing it . from the high honour , therefore , of mr delvile .
he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference . he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover patch . prepared to hear the result of the proceedings , and very certain that [male] would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty . he was not mistaken ; peering through the crevices of the wooden partition . he soon discovered the young girl , who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier .
as she was in mourning princess [female] did not go out into society . and [female] did not think it the proper thing to visit her again . but all the same the governor 's wife went on with her matchmaking . passing on to [female] the flattering things princess [male] said of him and vice versa . and insisting on his declaring himself to princess [male] .
rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with boris that . when the latter looked in after supper , he pretended to be asleep . and early next morning went away , avoiding boris , in his civilian clothes and a round hat . he wandered about the town , staring at the french and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and french emperors were staying . in a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner .
then [male] sprang to his feet . the sense of manhood and mastery . the right of control , the joy of possession . arose within him , even in his blindness , he was the stronger . even in his helplessness , for the great essentials , [male] must lean on him .
my father was a sort of foreman of the slaves on the plantation . and my mother presided over the kitchen at the big house and my master 's table . and among her other duties were to milk the cows and run the loom . weaving clothing for the other slaves , this left her scant time to look after me . so i early acquired the habit of looking out for myself , the other members of father 's family were my sister sally .
first , and partly by accident , they struck on certain books . a definite type of biographical novel that amory christened [male] ', books . in the [male] book the hero set off in life armed with the best weapons and avowedly intending to use them as such weapons are usually used . to push their possessors ahead as selfishly and blindly as possible , but the heroes of the [male] books discovered that there might be a more magnificent use for them .
he started , his dreams gone from him like a covey of frightened quail . the fence was cut , for a hundred yards or more along the hilltop it was cut at every post . making it impossible to piece , [male] could not have felt his resentment burn any hotter if it had been his own fence . it was a fence under his charge . the defiance was directed at him , he rode along to see if any cattle had escaped .
the request had not been foreseen , but was very graciously received , and [female] 's day was likely to end almost as well as it began . [female] had made up her mind to something different . and was a little disappointed ; but her conviction of being really the one preferred comforted her under it . and enabled her to receive mr. [female] 's parting attentions as she ought . he was certainly better pleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending the box .
morning school at this time of the year at bowick began at half past seven . there was an hour of school before breakfast . at which the doctor did not himself put in an appearance . he was wont to tell the boys that he had done all that when he was young . and that now in his old age it suited him best to have his breakfast before he began the work of the day .
he saw many fine sights during the three or four days after his coming to [location] . for he had to wait there at least that time , until a party that was expected from the north should arrive with news of where he was to go . these were the instructions he had had from rheims . so he walked freely abroad during these days to see the sights . and even ventured to pay a visit to fathers [male] and southwell .
and then , also , the old-fashioned phaeton , of old-fashioned old dr century was seen to rumble up to the big house . and it became known that lady [female] was not very well . `` not very well , '' when pronounced in a low , grave voice about lady [female] . always meant something serious , and , in this case , something serious was meant . lady [female] was not only ill , but frightened , it appeared , even to her .
alexandra took off her shade hat and threw it on the ground , [female] picked it up and played with the white ribbons . twisting them about her brown fingers as she talked . they made a pretty picture in the strong sunlight . the leafy pattern surrounding them like a net . the swedish woman so white and gold , kindly and amused , but armored in calm .
so when the queen sent for him to speak with her . he went as true knight to the castle . and fell into the trap that was set for him , in the battle that followed he was hard bestead . but slew sir agravaine at the first buffet , and within a little while he laid the twelve chosen knights cold to the earth . also he wounded sir mordred , who , when he escaped from the noble sir [male] .
but now that more than a month has passed , i really do not mind it so much . i feel so strong and prancy all the time that i can not keep from bubbling . i have to smile at myself , then another thing that helps is [male] and his ball . i never could really play with him before , but now i can not help it . but an awful thing happened about that yesterday , we were in the garden playing over by the lilac bushes .
in a few moments my luggage had come upstairs . and when they who brought it had finally disappeared , i went to the window again and looked out . opposite , on the same etage , were two windows , corresponding to my two . wide open , letting me see into an empty room , in which there seemed to be books and many sheets of white paper . a music desk and a vase of flowers .
next they gauged it several times daily . and learned that the diminution , whenever it occurred , was first apparent immediately after meal time . this focussed their attention on two suspects -- the second mate and the carpenter . who alone sat in the after room , the rest was easy , whenever mr. [male] arrived ahead of the carpenter more alcohol was missing . when they arrived and departed together , the alcohol was undisturbed , the carpenter was never alone in the room .
she was pale as a statue , her hands were icy cold . her head and heart throbbed with the awful strain upon her nerves . oh , this was cruel , cruel , what had she done to have deserved all this ? her choice was made : had she done a vile action or one that was sublime ? the recording angel , who writes in the book of gold .
he had succeeded by this time in turning the key in the lock . one of the gates rolled slowly back upon its rusty hinges . creaking and groaning as if in hoarse protest against all visitors to the towers . and [male] arundel entered the dreary domain which [male] had inherited from his kinsman . the postillion turned his horses from the highroad without the gates into the broad drive leading up to the mansion .
one morning , about three days after mr [organization] visit . there came to her two letters , as to neither of which did she know the writer by the handwriting . lady macleod had told her , -- with some hesitation . indeed , for lady macleod was afraid of her , -- but had told her . nevertheless , more than once , that those noble relatives had heard of the treatment to which mr grey was being subjected .
meantime , roslein is living in a state of quarantine . she is not permitted to speak with any other children , or even to look out of window at one . for fear she may contract some sort of contagious disease . and spoil our beautiful visit to burnet , she sends you a kiss . and so do i ; and mother and sylvia and [location] and grandmamma .
a convulsive sob at the door brought me around . it was the maid , who had entered and was glaring at me with a face to which the growing darkness gave an added repulsiveness . the sob , which had more of anger than of sorrow in it . had burst from her involuntarily , called forth . no doubt , by her inability to hinder me in my investigations .
natasha went to the table and without a moment 's reflection wrote that answer to princess [female] which she had been unable to write all the morning . in this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were at an end . that availing herself of the magnanimity of prince [male] who when he went abroad had given her her freedom . she begged princess [female] to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward her . but that she could not be his wife , at that moment this all seemed quite easy .
`` no , dearest ; go into the drawing room , '' [female] obediently did as she was bid . and there she sat , for the next three hours , wondering , wondering , wondering . during the greater part of that time . however , she well knew that mr gresham . senior , and mr gresham , junior , were both with her uncle , below . at eleven o'clock the doctor 's visitors came , he had expected them somewhat earlier .
he had been listening to the dismal howling of the winds . threatening damage to neighbouring chimney pots of rickety constitution . and thinking idly of the men that had come and gone amidst those old buildings . and how few amongst them all had left any mark behind them . inclined to speculate too how many of them had been men capable of better work than they had done .
[male] on the sin incarnadined , , , ah , love ! still temporal . and still atmospheric , teleologically unperturbed , we share a [male] by no divine divined . an earthly garden hidden from any cleric , untrodden of god . by no eternal curbed , hand trembling towards hand . the amazing lights of heart and eye .
i was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around . and the beautiful soft blue overhead , when my young lady . who had run down near the gate to procure some [male] roots for a border . returned only half laden , and informed [male] that mr. [male] was coming in . `` and he spoke to me , '' she added .
[female] passed the chief of the night in her sister 's room . and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr. [male] by a housemaid . and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn . desiring her mother to visit [female] , and form her own judgement of her situation .
patricia bit her lip , [female] bent solicitously over the angry miss wangle . whilst mr. [male] threatened to report mr. [male] to the food controller . [male] created a diversion by arriving with the soup . his white cotton gloves , several sizes too large even for his hands . caused him great anxiety , every spare moment during the evening he spent in clutching them at the wrists .
the origin of the name [female] is curious . [female] alfonso was almost as distinguished in the struggle against the moors in the reign of alfonso vii as the cid had been half a century before in that of alfonso vi . and was rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood of toledo . on one of his acquisitions , about two leagues from the city . he built himself a castle which he called cervatos .
i deserved your reproach : a hundred times i have wished to tell you the whole story of my travels and adventures among the savages . and one of the reasons which prevented me was the fear that it would have an unfortunate effect on our friendship . that was precious , and i desired above everything to keep it , but i must think no more about that now . i must think only of how i am to tell you my story , i will begin at a time when i was twenty three . it was early in life to be in the thick of politics .
[female] smiled , wally was like a tonic to her during these days of overwork . he seemed to be entirely unaffected by the general depression , a fact which he attributed himself to the happy accident of being in a position to sit back and watch the others toil . but in reality [male] knew that he was working as hard as any one . he was working all the time , changing scenes . adding lines , tinkering with lyrics , smoothing over principals whose nerves had become strained by the incessant rehearsing .
[female] stood it all until she was pronounced complete . then she came and stood in front of the cheap little glass . and surveyed herself , there were blisters in the glass that twisted her head into a grotesque shape . the hairpins stuck into her head , [female] had tied a spotted veil tight over her nose and eyes . the collar of the silk waist was frayed .
among the friends of mrs [female] ( who piqued herself at once on being society . and on maintaining intimate and easy relations with that power ) . mrs [female] occupied a front row , true , the hampton court bohemians . without exception , turned up their noses at [male] as an upstart . but they turned them down again , by falling flat on their faces to worship his wealth .
`` in all my father 's realm there are no such bells as these ! '' it was the laughing jackass , `` who gave you your name ? '' `` my godfathers and my godmothers in my baptism . '' well , his will have that to answer for , however safely for the rest he may have eschewed the world . the flesh , and the devil , poor bird .
`` take her away to the red room , and lock her in there , '' four hands were immediately laid upon me . and i was borne upstairs , i resisted all the way . a new thing for me , and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion bessie and miss abbot were disposed to entertain of me . the fact is , i was a trifle beside myself . or rather out of myself , as the french would say : i was conscious that a moment 's mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties .
`` the rain will be over soon , '' i said , but doubted if he heard me . what could he be thinking of so intently ? -- a poor working lad . whom few would have given credit for thinking at all , he pulled out his great silver watch . the dread of our house , for it was a watch which seemed to imbibe something of its master 's character . remorseless as justice or fate , it never erred a moment .
`` all as right as a trivet , '' said the captain ; and then he was off . `` i promised mamma that i would be home by seven , '' said [female] , rising from her chair , it can not be supposed that she had any wish to oblige mr [organization] . and therefore this movement on her part must be regarded simply as done in kindness to mrs greenow . she might be mistaken in supposing that mrs greenow would desire to be left alone with mr [organization] .
he rose up at last , cursing that wanton at malpas who had come to fling this fresh and terrible difficulty where already he had to face so many . he stood leaning upon the overmantel , his foot upon one of the dogs of the fender . and considered what to do , he must bear his burden in silence . that was all , he must keep this secret even from [male] , it split his heart to think that he must practise this deceit with her . but naught else was possible short of relinquishing her , and that was far beyond his strength .
i was filled with vague fears of some impending disaster . suddenly , with a shiver , i recognized cullen , scarcely a couple of yards away . also watching , wedged in among the throng , his lips were drawn closely together . his opera hat was well over his forehead . his eyes never left mr. [male] , he looked to me there like a lean faced rat preparing for its spring .
but he spoke of the day when [female] should come herself to the throne of england . and take that which was already hers ; when the night should roll away , and the morning star arise . and the faith should come again like the flowing tide , and all things be again as they had been from the beginning . it was rank treason that he talked . such as would have brought him to tyburn if it had been spoken in [location] in indiscreet company .
at night they returned , the boat glided along the shores of the islands . they sat at the bottom , both hidden by the shade , in silence . the square oars rang in the iron thwarts . and , in the stillness , seemed to mark time , like the beating of a metronome . while at the stern the rudder that trailed behind never ceased its gentle splash against the water .
indeed from this point , owing to the jutting out of the rocks , the land path was the shortest . and this way lay by the water side at an angle right below the cliff to which hepburn 's steps were leading him . he knew that on this long level field path he might easily be seen by any one following . nay , if he followed any one at a short distance , for it was full of turnings . and he resolved , late as he was , to sit down for a while till kinraid was far enough in advance for him to escape being seen .
after we had both recovered ourselves a little , and were able to talk , he told me how things stood . as to what i had written to his father , he told me he had not showed my letter to his father . or told him anything about it . that what his grandmother left me was in his hands . and that he would do me justice to my full satisfaction .
for an hour or more , after the rest had scattered to their respective duties . she was left alone , then mrs. [female] sent for her . when she entered her room . she found her occupied with the cook . and was allowed to stand unnoticed , `` when shall i be able to see mrs. redmain , ma'am ? ''
fain , the discovery of your sham addresses to her . to conceal your love to her niece , has provoked this separation . had you dissembled better , things might have continued in the state of nature , mira . i did as much as man could , with any reasonable conscience . i proceeded to the very last act of flattery with her .
`` with pet ? '' repeated mr [male] in his injured vein . pet , however , being close behind him , touched him on the shoulder . and mr [male] immediately forgave marseilles from the bottom of his heart . pet was about twenty , a fair girl with rich brown hair hanging free in natural ringlets . a lovely girl , with a [female] face .
[female] was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot . she was as much convinced of his meaning to gain [male] in time as of his deserving her . and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood . and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing . she would not speak to [female] with half the certainty she felt on the subject .
i never read mother goose or [male] copperfield or ivanhoe or [male] or blue beard or robinson crusoe or [male] eyre or [male] in wonderland or a word of rudyard kipling . i did not know that [male] the eighth was married more than once or that [male] was a poet . i did not know that people used to be monkeys and that the garden of eden was a beautiful myth . i did not know that [male] stood for [male] or that [male] eliot was a lady . i had never seen a picture of the `` mona lisa ''
pia went about his work as usual , and [male] mooned rather unhappily about the big room . to the duke this enforced imprisonment was no hardship . and he would sit in the little window seat watching galva as she flitted gracefully here and there in the performance of her tasks . no news came to them from the palace . and as it grew dusk and the lights of corbo shone in the sky .
all active services necessary for the comfort of the invalid were performed by olivia or her own special attendant . an old servant who had lived with the rector ever since his daughter 's birth . and had only left him to follow that daughter to [female] towers after her marriage . so [male] pollard had nothing to do but to keep very quiet . and patiently await the time when [female] might be disposed to talk to her , the farmer 's daughter was a gentle .
`` i do not see why she need know it all , '' and he dropped the two letters and the small envelope upon the dead logs and touched a match to their edges . then he carried three wine glasses out to the pantry . and carefully washed them , pouring again a few drops of clear wine . like residue , into their bottoms , `` coroners are inquisitive , '' he told himself musingly .
they returned within the time [male] had allotted them . they entered by the kitchen door . mr.john , when he saw me . merely bowed and passed through ; the two ladies stopped : [female] , in a few words . kindly and calmly expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to come down .
then finding him so good and kind , and anxious to improve the age . i told him almost everything ; how much i paid the fellmonger . and all the things i had been to see ; and how i longed to get away . before the corn was ripening ; yet how i felt myself bound to walk up and down . being under a thing called `` recognisance , '' in short , i told him everything .
this one , a thin stemmed goblet , he had won in a regimental steeple chase at colchester . he could remember the day with its clouds and grey sky and the dull look of the ploughed fields between the hedges . that pewter , which stood upon his writing table and which had formed a convenient holder for his pens . when pens had been of use , he had acquired very long ago in his college `` fours , '' when he was a freshman at oxford .
while he was thinking dully of this in some less sensitized part of his brain . his acuter faculties were going over and over the cries he had heard in the orchard . terror was the only thing that kept him from going back to her . terror that she might still be she . that she might still be suffering , a woman , mutilated and bleeding in his orchard .
bradley headstone and [male] duly got to the surrey side of westminster bridge . and crossed the bridge , and made along the middlesex shore towards millbank . in this region are a certain little street called church street . and a certain little blind square , called smith square . in the centre of which last retreat is a very hideous church with four towers at the four corners .
horses , yes , they have pretty good claret . here , eh , [male] ? he could never hit off his familiarity quite right . he had my lorded his young friend at first , and now brought out the name with a hesitating twang . which the young nobleman appreciated , but then the young nobleman was quite aware that the [male] was a friend for club purposes . and sporting purposes , and not for home use .
without waiting for a reply she left the room . presently returning with a box and a doll that seemed to mickey quite as large as peaches . it had a beautiful face , hair , real hair that could be combed . and real clothes that could be taken off , [female] had dressed it for a birthday gift for the little daughter of one of her friends . but by making haste she could prepare another , [male] in bewilderment .
it can also be fairly commended to the student of social science and of humanity . and above all to the student of those early ideas , which have gradually filtered down through the sands of time . and which seem to prove that the human nature of today is much the same as the human nature of the long ago . as a collection of facts , told in plain and simple language . it must be remembered that in those early days there was apparently no idea of embellishing the work .
[female] bent her tall form against the rain and gale . and fought her way through them , at first she had no clear idea as to where she was going . but presently , perhaps from custom , she took the path that ran across the fields to [female] church . it was a beautiful old church , particularly as regards the tower . one of the finest in the county , which had been partially blown down and rebuilt about the time of [female] i .
this was the right spirit , he said it so simply . so seriously , so innocently , that [male] was quite sure he really meant it . he was prepared , if necessary , to pay sixty odd pounds a week in rent . now , a man like that is the proper kind of man for a respectable neighbourhood . he will keep a good saddle horse , join the club .
this had been her picture , now she could not suppress a laugh as she noted the contrast between it and the original . she was even two inches shorter than ester herself . with a manner much more like a fairy 's than a queen 's . instead of heavy coils of [female] hair . there were little rings of brown curls clustering around a fair , pale forehead .
how master bore the news , when he first heard it . is more than i can tell , not having been present , when i did see him he looked awfully overcome by it . to be sure , he sat quiet in a corner , with his fat hands hanging over his thick knees . and his head down , and his eyes looking at nothing . he seemed not so much sorry , as scared and dazed like , by what had happened .
for this reason the ladies themselves were interesting to ruthven smith . and he might have been equally so to them if he would have told them picturesquely all he knew about the history of their wonderful diamonds . pearls , emeralds , and rubies . it was too bad that he would not , for there was not a famous jewel in england or [location] of which ruthven smith had not every ancient scandal in connection with it at his tongue 's end . but on his tongue 's end it stayed .
and poor job too , his presentiment had come true , and there was an end of him . well , he has a strange burial place -- no norfolk hind ever had a stranger . or ever will ; and it is something to lie in the same [location] as the poor remains of the imperial she . we looked our last upon them and the indescribable [female] glow in which they lay . and then with hearts far too heavy for words we left them .
they did not speak of kedsty , or the tragedy . or again of the death of [male] , but kent told of his days in the north . of his aloneness , of the wild , weird love in his soul for the deepest wildernesses . and from that he went away back into dim and distant yesterdays . alive with mellowed memories of boyhood days spent on a farm .
and as the deep , tawny brown eye of the man bending before her flashed into her own . for the first time in her life [female] 's lids fell . and as she swept her curtsey of stately obeisance her heart struck like a hammer against her side . the effort had , in sooth , been in vain . and he had passed many a sleepless night ; and when , as time went on .
at the two extremities of the port , in order that their fires should converge upon the great axis of the ellipse formed by the basin . in the first place , two batteries had been raised , evidently destined to receive flank pieces . for [male] saw the workmen finishing the platform and making ready the demi circumference in wood upon which the wheels of the pieces might turn to embrace every direction over the epaulement . by the side of each of these batteries other workmen were strengthening gabions filled with earth . the lining of another battery , the latter had embrasures .
it was a june sunday in the boarding house bedroom . and for that matter it was not the boarding house bedroom at all . it was the old orthodox church on tory hill in edgewood . the windows were wide open , and the smell of the purple clover and the humming of the bees were drifting into the sweet . wide spaces within , [male] was sitting in the end of the peabody pew .
hoofs were heard , kutuzov and his suite were returning to the town . the commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease . and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men . in the second file from the right flank , beside which the carriage passed the company . a blue eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice , it was dolokhov marching with particular [male] and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company .
which had descended to him through successive generations , he did not move as i advanced . or manifest the slightest emotion of surprise , merely saying , `` hullo , [male] , '' as if he expected me to remark that mother had sent me over to see if he had any ice cream left over from dinner . it probably did not occur to [male] that i had been absent twenty five years . if it had occurred to him , he would have considered such a trifling flight of time not worth mentioning .
nevertheless he had gone to reside there , hunting a good deal and farming a little . making himself popular in the district , and keeping up the good name of grantly in a successful way . till -- alas , -- it had seemed good to him to throw those favouring eyes on poor [male] crawley . his wife had now been dead just two years , and as he was still under thirty . no one could deny it would be right that he should marry again .
she seated herself at a small table alone . and an attentive waiter at once approached to take her order , she did not want a profusion . she craved a nice and tasty bite -- a half dozen blue points . a plump chop with cress . a something sweet -- a creme frappee , for instance .
through the humming , fevered city they slipped . merely one of many vehicles , the streets were filled with walking people . without destination or object , walking only from consuming restlessness or excitement . the murmur of countless voices rose above the throbbing voice of the automobile as it wound in and out among the crowds . on every corner men were collected in groups .
but her heart kept on sinking , what hotel should she go to ? if she told a cabman to drive to an hotel . any hotel , what would he do -- or say ? he might drive to something dreadfully expensive . and not at all the quiet sort of thing she required . finally she decided that even for an hotel she must look round .
lady monk took an occasion to introduce mr [male] to [male] fitzgerald . with what object it is difficult to say , unless she was anxious to make mischief between the men . [male] scowled at him ; but mr [male] did not notice the scowl . and put out his hand to his late rival most affably , [male] was forced to take it . and as he did so made a little speech , i am sorry that we have not the pleasure of seeing lady [male] with you , ', said he .
he could hear bathsheba 's voice immediately inside the canvas . she was conversing with a man , a warmth overspread his face . surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in a fair , he wondered if . then , she reckoned upon his death as an absolute certainty . to get at the root of the matter , troy took a penknife from his pocket and softly made two little cuts crosswise in the cloth .
mrs. [female] was silenced , in growing discomfort they drove homewards . the city seemed satanic , the narrower streets oppressing like the galleries of a mine . no harm was done by the fog to trade , for it lay high . and the lighted windows of the shops were thronged with customers . it was rather a darkening of the spirit which fell back upon itself .
`` do not be in a hurry or let anything slip , '' levin said to himself , feeling a greater and greater flow of physical energy and attention to all that lay before him to do . having ascertained that the doctor was not getting up , levin considered various plans , and decided on the following one . that [location] should go for another doctor , while he himself should go to the chemist 's for opium . and if when he came back the doctor had not yet begun to get up .
the bare trees , the sand . the bricks and roofs of the houses . the green church spire , and the corners of [organization] in the distance . all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness . near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half burned mansion occupied by the french .
hailing a cab , he drove to grosvenor square . all the exaltation of an hour ago had turned to ashes . his excitement had found its culmination in a sense of futility and premonition . he met no one in the hall or on the stairs of [organization] 's house . and on entering the study he found that also deserted , greening had been among the most absorbed of those who had listened to his speech .
pa sloane drove back home . with the sorrel mare still unshod , the baby . and the baby 's meager bundle of clothes . the baby did not trouble him much . it had become well used to strangers in the past two months .
the bride and bridegroom were at breakfast when the paper came . there were also three letters , all for knight , the first which either had received since their marriage . knight cut open the envelopes slowly . one after the other , and made no comment , [female] could not help wondering if the countess had written . for an involuntary glance had made her sure that one of knight 's letters was from a woman .
at the end of september the timber had been carted for building the cattleyard on the land that had been allotted to the association of peasants . and the butter from the cows was sold and the profits divided . in practice the system worked capitally , or , at least , so it seemed to levin . in order to work out the whole subject theoretically and to complete his book . which , in levin 's daydreams , was not merely to effect a revolution in political economy .
but some inner voice seemed to whisper to her that [female] was no more , [female] drove to pos'ham several times to learn if the captain 's sisters had received any more definite tidings than these flying reports . but that family had heard nothing which could in any way relieve the [female] 's anxiety . when at last , at the end of november , there appeared a final and revised list of killed and wounded as issued by admiral [female] . it was a useless sheet to the lovedays . to their great pain it contained no names but those of officers .
when the legs of both the male and the female are stretched straight out over each other . it is called the `` clasping position , '' it is of two kinds . the side position and the supine position . according to the way in which they lie down , in the side position the male should invariably lie on his left side . and cause the woman to lie on her right side .
if after leaving the gilded saloons aforesaid you should happen to wander through the [location] streets . you may meet another character in this history . you may see a sweet pale face , still stamped with a child-like roundness and simplicity . but half hidden in the coarse hood of the nun , you may see her . and if you care to follow you may find what is the work wherein she seeks her [female] .
business on sir [male] 's part . and a violent cold on her own , prevented their calling in [location] street . the invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near . necessary as it was in common civility to mrs. [female] . that they should both attend her on such a visit , [female] had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go .
beloved , you have the yes and no to all this : i have not . and can not have , something that you have not chosen for me to know . you know : it should be a burden on your conscience . surely , not to have shared it with me , maybe there is something i know that you do not . in the way of sorrow , i think and wish -- yes , in the way of love .
when [male] arrived in the neighborhood , fauchelevent , an ex notary and a peasant who was almost educated . had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way , fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich . while he , a lawyer , was being ruined , this had filled him with jealousy . and he had done all he could , on every occasion . to injure [male] , then bankruptcy had come ; and as the old man had nothing left but a cart and a horse .
[female] had been ill , and was abroad on leave in an effort to shake off the lingering effects of typhoid fever contracted in the [location] . he was under orders to report for duty at [location] on the first of april . and it was now late march , he and his sister had spent the morning at their brother 's school and were enjoying a late dejeûner at the monte [male] . there existed between them a [male] comradeship that was in no wise affected by divergent tastes and temperaments . [male] had just attained his captaincy , and was the youngest man of his rank in the service .
this he said in the teeth of the words which had fallen from him unawares in the presence of mr. [male] . but they could not punish him for a lie . not even for such a lie as that , he was not upon oath . and they could not make him responsible to the law because he had held his tongue upon a matter as to which it was manifest to them all that he had known the whole history during the entire period of mr. [male] 's persecution . they could only call upon him to account for his possession of the cheque .
his reflections were not very cheerful , from the time of his arrival in [location] . he had been mixed up with public affairs ; but his own private affairs had made no great progress . either in love or fortune , as to love , the only woman he could have loved was [female] , [female] , and [male] . [male] had disappeared , without his being able to discover what had become of her . as to fortune , he had made -- he , humble as he was .
he talked to her an hour or more , of the children . and a hundred little things , till the carriage came round to take her home . and when she had gone he went back to his chair . and sat there smoothing his face and chin , dreaming over the day . when he had sealed and stamped the envelope , he went back to the window and drew in a long breath .
she would smile at his eccentricities , his intolerance . his supreme belief in himself , and his almost fanatical determination to `` ginger up '' any and every one in the british empire whose misfortune it was to exist outside the dominion of [location] . at odd moments he told her much about [location] . and how little that country was understood in england , how blind british statesmen were to the fact that the eyes of many canadians were turned anxiously towards the great republic upon their borders . how in the rapid growth of the u.s.a. they saw a convincing argument in favour of a tightening of the bonds that bound the dominion to the old country .
the train stopped in a blaze of [female] at framlynghame admiral . which is made up entirely of the name board , two platforms , and an overhead bridge . without even the usual siding , i had never known the slowest of locals stop here before . but on sunday all things are possible to the [location] and southwestern , one could hear the drone of conversation along the carriages . and , scarcely less loud , the drone of the bumblebees in the wallflowers up the bank .
pent up rains dissolve in mists , yonder sea appears a fiery furnace in which the rains are falling . flames seem to issue from the waves , the white gleam of the ocean under the shower is reflected to marvellous distances . the different masses transform themselves into uncouth shapes . monstrous whirlpools make strange hollows in the sky . the vapours revolve , the waves spin .
then he went to his door , unbolted it . and walked downstairs to find the landlord , it was not until ten days later . soon after dawn , that robin set out on his melancholy errand . he rode out northward as soon as the gates were opened , with young `` mr. [male] , '' a priest ordained with him in rheims .
it is not to be marvelled at that amid such place as this , for the first time visited . the horses were a little skeary ; and their riders partook of the feeling . as all good riders do , in and out of the tufts they went . with their eyes dilating , wishing to be out of harm , if conscience were but satisfied . and of this tufty flaggy ground , pocked with bogs and boglets .
`` the fact that we drink it does not explain what it is , '' he would retort , you ask your teacher what water is ', . and then he would leave her with this irritating problem troubling her young soul . food , [location] , her dress . anything was apt to be brought back to its chemical constituents .
i slung down on him time enough to blow him in two . and pulled on my trigger , not aimin to hurt the old sooner , only to snap a bullet between his toes . but she would not work , old [male] he was so rattled at the sight of that gun in my hand he banged loose . slap through the winder into that box of plug back of the counter . i pulled on her and pulled on her .
at school , her studies of her sister 's adopted tongue had been confined to dry lesson books . but when she had been free to choose her own literature , in [location] and [location] . she had read more widely , people whom she had told of her sister 's marriage . and her own mission , had sent her several rare volumes , -- among others a valuable old copy of the koran . and she had devoured them all , delighting in the facility which grew with practice .
i am sure he does not , molly , you need not defend him on my account . but i am [male] still looks upon me as `` an encumbrance , '' as the advertisements in the times always call [female] unfortunate children . but i have been an encumbrance to her all my life . i am getting very much into despair about everything , molly .
[female] , and running into her own room for her parasol . attended her noble guest downstairs , as they passed through the hall . lady [female] opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room . and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on . her carriage remained at the door , and [female] saw that her waiting woman was in it .
he kissed her lips . but the night that surrounded them was rent asunder . they fled as at the approach of a storm and their eyes . filled with dread of [female] , showed them . before they disappeared , high up above them , an immense night bird that stared at them with its blazing eyes and seemed to cling to the string of [female] 's lyre .
the heralds quite agreed with me that a ridd might have been there , or thereabouts . and if he was there , he was almost certain to have done his best . being in sight of hearth and home . and it was plain that he must have had good legs to be at the same time both there and in athelney . and good legs are an argument for good arms .
it was asking a great deal of those men to give up their established diversion . no matter how distinguished the man in whose favor they were requested to stand aside . that sunday afternoon race had become as much a fixed institution in the bad lands as the railroad itself . with some argument , some bucking and snorting . a considerable cost to [male] for liquor and cigars .
she had better luck than so rash an enterprise deserved . mr. [female] came up to her expectations , age had not withered him . nor could custom stale his infinite variety in half an hour , his [male] neatness and compactness . his small hands and feet , his teeming ready brain . his unaffected accessibility , and a certain fine apprehensiveness which stamped him as susceptible from his topmost hair to his tipmost toe , proved irresistible .
this man perfectly comprehended that he hated his rival with his strongest and worst forces . and that if he tracked him to [male] . his so doing would never serve himself with her , or serve her . all his pains were taken , to the end that he might incense himself with the sight of the detested figure in her company and favour . in her place of concealment , and he knew as well what act of his would follow if he did .
they were fair haired girls , very like each other , of whom i have before my mind 's eye a distinct portrait . which i fear i shall not be able to draw in any such manner as will make it distinct to others . they were something below the usual height . being slight and slender in all their proportions , [female] was the shorter of the two . but the difference was so trifling that it was hardly remembered unless the two were together .
my sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us . that never varied , first , with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard and fast against her bib . where it sometimes got a pin into it . and sometimes a needle , which we afterwards got into our mouths . then she took some butter on a knife and spread it on the loaf .
one shot struck a french soldier 's foot . and from behind the screens came the strange sound of a few voices shouting . instantly as at a word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the french general . officers , and men changed to one of determined concentrated readiness for strife and suffering . to all of them from the marshal to the least soldier .
trembling all over , he looked at his watch ; it was a quarter to nine . he rose stiffly to his feet and sank into his chair . after a moment he lighted a cigar . the handkerchief lay at his feet ; he could just see the ring over the edge of his knees . for a long time he sat staring , the striking of a church clock nearby roused him .
ah , his confidence in a fatherhood more omniscient than his own had not been misplaced . loving hands had borne his [male] safely through the waves to a home where . in an atmosphere of devotion , the beauty that had been in her from the beginning had perfected in its maturity . even the homely surroundings of the environment into which she drifted could not stifle her native fineness of soul . bred up a fisherman 's daughter she had lived and moved among plain .
came days of storm , days and nights of storm . when the ocean menaced [female] with its roaring whiteness . and the wind smote our struggling boat with a titan 's buffets . and ever we were flung off , farther and farther , to the north east , it was in such a storm . and the worst that we had experienced , that i cast a weary glance to leeward .
the father , as by some strange final illusion , felt as if all his fate depended on his ensuring to [female] her happiness . she who could never suffer , because she never formed vital connections . she who could lose the dearest things of her life and be just the same the next day . the whole memory dropped out , as if deliberately , she whose will was so strangely and easily free . anarchistic , almost nihilistic , who like a soulless bird flits on its own will .
he had broken his collar bone and three of his ribs . they got a farmer 's trap from wissindine and took him into oakham . when there , he insisted on being taken on through [location] to the willingford bull before he would have his bones set . picking up , however , a surgeon at [location] , [male] remained with him for a couple of days . losing his run with the fitzwilliams and a day at the potted peas .
and dropping his head in his hands as he sat on his low bed . [male] would mourn over all he had lost in tearless misery . till merciful sleep would comfort him with dreams of the happy days when the boys played together . or those still later and happier ones when all smiled on him , and plumfield seemed to have gained a new and curious charm . there was one poor fellow in [male] 's shop whose fate was harder than his .
and all this had been accomplished in the stamping ground of storm , at the end of the world . by a handful of wretched weaklings , under the drive of two strong mates . with behind them the placid will of the samurai . it had taken thirty minutes to wear ship . and i had learned how the best of shipmasters can lose their ships without reproach .
i shall never know whether it was the journey in the train . the air and cooking of meadowvale . or the visits to the burying ground , that upset me . but for the first time in a dozen years i found myself dissatisfied with my home . i remarked to malachy that the roses seemed to be in a most discouraging condition .
these evils were in a great measure counterbalanced by the stern resolution and restless activity of king [male] . who , with some of his best knights , was ever on horseback , ready to repair to any point where danger occurred . and often not only bringing unexpected succour to the christians , but discomfiting the infidels when they seemed most secure of victory . but even the iron frame of coeur [male] lion could not support without injury the alternations of the unwholesome climate . joined to ceaseless exertions of body and mind .
if [male] really kept to his intention of staying away for a few days she must trump up some explanation of his absence . but her mind refused to work , and the only thing she could think of was to take strefford into her confidence . she knew that he could be trusted in a real difficulty . his impish malice transformed itself into a resourceful ingenuity when his friends required it . the maid stood looking at her with a puzzled gaze .
[male] , he cried . stung by the remembrance of his exacting and dictatorial ways with her . `` what a brute i have been to you ! '' `` katharine , katharine , '' he said aloud , and then , looking round . saw [male] walking slowly away from him , tearing a long spray of ivy from the trees as she passed them .
on a late summer day swithin stepped from the train at warborne . and , directing his baggage to be sent on after him , set out on foot for old welland once again . it seemed but the day after his departure . so little had the scene changed , true , there was that change which is always the first to arrest attention in places that are conventionally called unchanging . a higher and broader vegetation at every familiar corner than at the former time .
[female] is uppermost in my memory , and he passes first in the shadowy procession of my absent friends . i received a few lines from him . after the landing of the expedition in [location] . written more cheerfully and hopefully than he has written yet , a month or six weeks later i saw an extract from an [male] newspaper . describing the departure of the adventurers on their inland journey .
[female] opened her lips and drew in her breath . as if to reply with equal vigor , when the shutting of a door in the next room withdrew her attention . and they both became conscious that the voices , which had been rising and falling round the tea table . had fallen silent ; the light , even , seemed to have sunk lower , a moment later mrs. [female] appeared in the doorway of the ante room . she stood looking at them with a smile of expectancy on her face .
instantly he unlocked a small gate at his right . i passed in and , with professional sang froid , proceeded to take my way to the house through the double row of evergreens bordering the semicircular approach . as these trees stood very close together and were , besides , heavily laden with fresh fallen snow . i failed to catch a glimpse of the building itself until i stood in front of it . then i saw that it was brilliantly lighted and gave evidence here and there of some festivity .
at a quarter past ten the chief justice was on the bench . with a second judge to help him , and with lords and distinguished commoners and great city magnates crowding the long seat between him and the doorway . the court was full , so that you would say that another head could not be made to appear . and [male] finn , the member for tankerville . was in the dock , [male] , who was there to see , -- as one of the great ones .
the view of this building revived in the mind of the beholder the memory of past ages . the manners and characters which distinguished them arose to his fancy . and through the long lapse of years he discriminated those customs and manners which formed so striking a contrast to the modes of his own times . the rude manners , the boisterous passions . the daring ambition , and the gross indulgences which formerly characterized the priest .
the senora went her usual rounds of inspection , fed her birds . spoke to every one in her usual tone , sat in her carved chair with her hands folded . gazing out on the southern sky , ramona busied herself with her usual duties . dusted the chapel , put fresh flowers before all the madonnas . and then sat down at her embroidery , ramona had been for a long time at work on a beautiful altar cloth for the chapel .
but how was he to get at violet effingham ? from the moment at which he had left saulsby he had been angry with himself for not having asked lord brentford to allow him to remain there till after the baldock party should have gone on to loughlinter . the earl , who was very lonely in his house , would have consented at once . [male] , indeed , was driven to confess to himself that success with violet would at once have put an end to all his friendship with lord brentford . as also to all his friendship with lord [male] , he would .
as i lay there thinking , i naturally dwelt upon myself and my situation . it was unparalleled , undreamed of , that i , [female] , a scholar and a dilettante . if you please , in things artistic and literary , should be lying here on a bering sea seal hunting schooner , cabin boy ! i had never done any hard manual labour , or scullion labour . in my life , i had lived a placid .
going up to him i asked whether he had seen my servant . he could give me no news of him . i had no luggage ticket . for mine had been in bauer 's hands . but i prevailed on him to allow me to look at the baggage which had arrived .
he knew that he could not stay in his room . that it would be impossible for him to sleep , and he was not in a condition to rejoin adare and his wife . he wanted to walk -- to find relief in physical exertion . of a sudden his mind was made up , he extinguished the light . then he reopened the window , and dropped out into the night again .
he had supposed he should find her with her pupil in the school room . but he learned from a servant that [organization] had gone to francheuil with her step brother . and that miss viner was still in her room , darrow sent her word that he was the bearer of a message from the lodge . and a moment later he heard her coming down the stairs . darrow lingered on in the hall , not knowing if she meant to return .
the first fall -- kuzovlev 's , at the stream . agitated everyone , but [male] saw distinctly on [male] 's pale . triumphant face that the man she was watching had not fallen . when , after mahotin and vronsky had cleared the worst barrier . the next officer had been thrown straight on his head at it and fatally injured .
but this aggravated him more than before , that she should put so far upon him . and run things such a length upon no other authority than a hearsay . and then , turning to me again , said very honestly , he was afraid we were both undone . `` for , to be plain , my dear , i have no estate , '' says he . `` what little i had , this devil has made me run out in waiting on you and putting me into this equipage . ''
the man reported that baldos had been seen on the balcony alone . evidently on watch , rashly he made his way to the castle front . a bright moon cast its mellow glow over the mass of stone outlined against the western sky . for an hour he glowered in the shade of the trees . giving but slight heed to the guards who passed from time to time .
rodney resumed his seat , with his manuscript on his knee . and from time to time he glanced at denham . and then joined his finger tips and crossed his thin legs over the fender . as if he experienced a good deal of pleasure . at length denham shut the book .
mrs. silver was not of these , true , she sometimes professed herself averse to all `` animals , '' but this meant nothing more than her unwillingness to have her work increased by their introduction into the atwater household , no . the appearance of the dog had stirred something queer and fundamental within her . all coloured people look startled the first time they see a french poodle . but there is a difference , most coloured men do not really worry much about being coloured .
as thus the king with his foresters frolicked it among the shepherds . [male] came in with a fair mazer full of cider . and presented it to [male] with such a clownish salute that he began to smile . and took it of the old shepherd very kindly , drinking to [female] and the rest of her fair maids . amongst whom [female] was the foremost , [male] pledged the king .
it was like a house with a high , thick roof of oak tree tops . the shelter they found , no sun penetrated it . a tiny trickle of water still remained , and some grass along its rims was still green . spite of the long drought , -- a scanty meal for baba and benito . but they ate it with relish in each other 's company .
abruptly , then , at ban cruach 's feet , he slipped and fell . for a second it seemed that he could not move , his back was turned toward the ice folk . his body was bent forward , and shielded so , his hands worked with feverish speed . from his cloak he tore a strip of cloth . from the iron boss he took the glittering lens .
and it was even so , the entire council was present with the exception of [male] . who was home ill. his running mate yates was heartily in favour of doing all and sundry of those things which would aid and encourage the building of the much to be desired railroad and offered no objection to the motion to grant a sixty day temporary franchise . however , he always played ball with the absent [male] and he was fairly well acquainted with his other colleagues on the council . where they were concerned he was as suspicious as a rattlesnake in august . in consequence of which he considered it policy to play safe pending [male] 's recovery .
there was something almost divine in this man . who was thus august , without being himself aware of it , [male] was in the shadow . and stood motionless , with his iron candlestick in his hand . frightened by this luminous old man , never had he beheld anything like this . this confidence terrified him , the moral world has no grander spectacle than this .
meanwhile a circumstance occurred which increased the general discord , and threatened emilia with the loss of her last remaining comfort . the advice and consolation of madame [female] menon . the marchioness , whose passion for the count [female] vereza had at length yielded to absence . and the pressure of present circumstances , now bestowed her smiles upon a young italian cavalier . a visitor at the castle , who possessed too much of the spirit of gallantry to permit a lady to languish in vain .
he sent for the carpenter , who , according to his orders . ought to have been at work at the thrashing machine , but it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows . which ought to have been repaired before lent , this was very annoying to levin . it was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farm work against which he had been striving with all his might for so many years . the hurdles , as he ascertained , being not wanted in winter .
it is very heavy and is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night shirt . yet plenty used it for that -- tax collectors . and reformers , and one horse kings with a defective title . and those sorts of people ; then you put on your shoes . flat boats roofed over with interleaving bands of steel .
she was sitting , therefore , quite alone , and as stiff as a man in armour . when lady milborough was shown up to her , and lady milborough herself was not at all comfortable as she commenced the interview . she had prepared many wise words to be spoken . but was not so little ignorant of the character of the woman with whom she had to deal . as to suppose that the wise words would get themselves spoken without interruption .
she wept painfully , violently , with the resistance of strong natures unused to emotional expression . till at length , through the tumult of her tears . she felt her husband 's reassuring touch . [male] , he said , speaking once more in his natural voice . she raised her face from her hands .
this gave colville consolation which no religion or philosophy could have brought him . and his pleasure was not marred , but rather heightened , by the little pangs of expectation . bred by long custom , that from moment to moment imogene would appear . she did not appear , and a thrill of security succeeded upon each alarm . he wished her well with all his heart .
and now about the final parting ; for i may as well rush at it at once . i need hardly tell you that no care for father or mother shall make me put off my marriage . of course i owe everything to you now . and as they have approved it , i have no right to think of them in opposition to you . and you must not suppose that they ask me to stay .
they were in [location] , now , they had saved up six dollar and twenty cents . despite the fact that father had overborne her caution and made her dine at a lunch room . now and then , or sleep at a hotel , while he cheerfully scavenged in the neighborhood . the shoes he had bought in [location] were impossible . they had been mended and resoled , but the new soles had large concentric holes .
their foster mothers may not even have had an egg in the incubator . as was the case with sola , who had not commenced to lay , until less than a year before she became the mother of another woman 's offspring . but this counts for little among the green martians , as parental and filial love is as unknown to them as it is common among us . i believe this horrible system which has been carried on for ages is the direct cause of the loss of all the finer feelings and higher humanitarian instincts among these poor creatures . from birth they know no father or mother love .
they now crossed mellstock bridge . and went along an embowered path beside the froom towards the church and vicarage . meeting voss with the hot mead and bread and cheese as they were approaching the churchyard . this determined them to eat and drink before proceeding further , and they entered the church and ascended to the gallery . the lanterns were opened , and the whole body sat round against the walls on benches and whatever else was available .
such a box had [female] seen , in the first of her dreams . going out of the old house in the dead of the night under double 's arm . this , [female] put on the ground at her old master 's feet . this , [female] fell on her knees by , and beat her hands upon . crying half in exultation and half in despair .
but the child [female] , it seemed . was of lustier stock than her older sisters , and this those about her soon found out to their grievous disturbance . when mother posset had drawn her from under her dead mother 's body she had not left shrieking for an hour . but had kept up her fierce cries until the roof rang with them . and the old woman had jogged her about and beat her back in the hopes of stifling her .
but that necessity , which pressed me to a settlement suitable to my condition . was my authority for it ; and certainly his affection to me . and the goodness of his temper , however they might argue against using him ill . yet they strongly argued to me that he would better take the disappointment than some fiery tempered wretch . who might have nothing to recommend him but those passions which would serve only to make a woman miserable all her days .
she felt that he was waiting for her to speak , and at last she turned to him . `` i shall see you tomorrow before you go ... '' she moved toward the door and he held it open for her . she saw his hand on the door . and his seal ring in its setting of twisted silver .
for some distance their course dipped downward at a gentle angle . while the ceilings and sides dripped with moisture . soon they heard the sound of running water . and entering a wider room saw sparkling in the lantern 's light a stream that came from under the rocky wall . crossed their path , and disappeared under the other wall of the chamber .
he did not tire , at times he wanted to run on ahead of jean and the dogs . yet he saw that no such desire seized upon jean . steadily -- with a precision that was almost uncanny -- the half breed led the way . he did not hurry , he did not hesitate , he was like a strange spirit of the night itself . a voiceless and noiseless shadow ahead , an automaton of flesh and blood that had become more than human to [male] .
our annie looked rather queer at this , having no pretensions to be one . but she conquered herself , and said , `` yes , [female] ; and many of them liked you . '' as i finished very sternly a speech which had exhausted me more than ten rounds of wrestling . but i was carried away by the truth , as sometimes happens to all of us . [male] had not a word to say ; albeit his mind was so much more nimble and rapid than ever mine was .
he had gone to his room after luncheon to get some belated letters off his conscience . and when he had left her she had continued to sit in the same place . her hands crossed on her knees . her head slightly bent , in an attitude of brooding retrospection . as she looked back at her past life , it seemed to her to have consisted of one ceaseless effort to pack into each hour enough to fill out its slack folds .
house at booth 's edge that the priest had been taken . and it was freely rumoured that although mr. [female] had once been betrothed to her . yet that she had released and sent him herself to rheims . and all to end like this , and yet she could bear to come and see him again . and , it was said , would be present somewhere in the crowd even at his death .
the count threw away his cigarette , and joined [male] at the table . with his hands carelessly thrust into the scarlet belt of his blouse . and his eyes steadily fixed on sir [male] 's face . [male] , who was on the other side of her husband . with the pen in her hand , looked at him too .
nettle seed needs no digging , the ruin of this countryside by railroads was discussed . not only at the `` weights and scales , '' but in the hay field . where the muster of working hands gave opportunities for talk such as were rarely had through the rural year . one morning , not long after that interview between mr. [male] and [male] . in which she confessed to him her feeling for [female] .
the other a brunette , with a fierce and haughty expression , and as straight as a poplar . it is unnecessary to state that , in the eyes of the young man . [female] did not suffer by the contrast , in about half an hour the girls went away . and maximilian understood that mademoiselle danglars visit had at last come to an end . in a few minutes [female] re entered the garden alone .
for so are our false steps turned back to good by the evil to which they lead us . turnbull was ready to take every safe advantage to be gained from his partner 's comparative carelessness about money . he drew a larger proportion of the profits than belonged to his share in the capital . justifying himself on the ground that he had a much larger family . did more of the business , and had to keep up the standing of the firm .
as he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now always occupied his mind . about life and death , and chiefly about death . he felt himself nearer to it . once again it pushed from outside , his last superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened . it entered , and it was death .
no one hated him , but they attacked the younger branch of the divine right in [male] as they had attacked its elder branch in [male] . and that which they wished to overturn in overturning royalty in [location] . was , as we have explained , the usurpation of man over man . and of privilege over right in the entire universe . [location] without a king has as result the world without despots .
she turned away as in shame and indignation . she would gladly have thrown something at his head . she fled , re entered the house , and shut herself up in her chamber to peruse the manuscript once more . to learn it by heart , and to dream , when she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her bosom . all was over , [female] had fallen back into deep , seraphic love .
i do hope that i may see you sometimes . i can not explain to you how very much out of your line `` we '' shall be . for of course there is a `` we , '' people are more separated with [male] than they are . i suppose , with you , and my `` we '' is a very poor man . who works hard at writing in a dingy newspaper office , and we shall live in a garret and have brown sugar in our tea .
his style of paying compliments , charming to superficial people . seemed insulting to others of more delicacy , by its triteness and the cool assurance of its cut and dried flattery . as a matter of fact , melchior lied like a courtier . he remarked without blushing to the duc [male] chaulieu . who made no impression whatever when he was obliged to address the chamber as minister of foreign affairs .
these tunnels of cells usually terminated in a sack of a lowest dungeon . with a vat like bottom , where dante placed [male] . where society placed those condemned to death , a miserable human existence . once interred there ; farewell light , air , life . ogni speranza -- every hope ; it only came forth to the scaffold or the stake .
the corporate decay , however , of the forsytes , their dispersion rather . of which all this was symptomatic , had not advanced so far as to prevent a rally when [female] died in 1899 . it had been a glorious summer , and after holidays abroad and at the sea they were practically all back in [location] . when [male] with a touch of his old originality had suddenly breathed his last at his own house in princes gardens . at [male] 's it was whispered sadly that poor [male] had always been eccentric about his digestion .
who had sent her to school , had never been anything but kind and just to her and to everybody . who had taught her life and , thank god , love . was she really the june tolliver who had gone out into the world and had held her place there . who had conquered birth and speech and customs and environment so that none could tell what they all once were . who had become the lady , the woman of the world . in manner , dress , and education .
such was the home which was to put mansfield out of her head , and teach her to think of her [female] with moderated feelings . on the contrary , she could think of nothing but mansfield . its beloved inmates , its happy ways , everything where she now was in full contrast to it . the elegance , propriety , regularity , harmony . and perhaps , above all , the [female] and tranquillity of mansfield .
all the great courts were quiet in the sun , and full of vacant echoes . moss had grown over the glassy pavement , and begun to creep within the dusty council halls . an idle wind blew round an empty throne and stirred the heavy curtains on the walls . how fair this cool deep silence to a wanderer deaf with the roar of winds along the open skies ! sweet , after sting and bitter kiss of sea water .
the sense of the distance to which her [female] past had been removed was never more present to him than when . a day or two later , he went with his mother and sisters to return her visit . the region beyond the river existed , for the durham ladies . only as the unmapped environment of the bon marche . and nannie durham 's exclamation on the pokiness of the streets and the dulness of the houses showed durham .
and the honeymoon was in keeping with the engagement , the roar of cannon and the clash of swords was the music that played at my wedding . and the answer ? ah , the heart alone can feel it . the lips can not express it , that was our honeymoon . with the shame of lost battles in our hearts . and despairing even of divine justice , those who can love under such circumstances must love dearly indeed !
then , as the question he asked and the answer he received were heard only by the elfin sprites dancing in the brook beside them . so we will leave it to those fairies to tell if they choose . suffice it to say it was such as filled his heart so full of happiness it could no longer hold a secret . and there , where the moonlight fell in little rifts upon them . and the music of running water echoed their feelings .
it happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose between estella and miss [organization] . it was the first time i had ever seen them opposed . we were seated by the fire , as just now described , and miss [organization] still had estella 's arm drawn through her own . and still clutched estella 's hand in hers . when estella gradually began to detach herself , she had shown a proud impatience more than once before .
he turned on his heel and strode away , [location] kept on spatting her butter . the little perpendicular wrinkle had come between her brows again , at that moment an odd . almost uncanny resemblance to the old portrait of her great-great-grandfather . which hung on the parlour wall at home . came out on her girlish face , the fortnight passed by , [male] was silent and sullen .
then he got out a serviette , also old and ragged , but possessing some measure of cleanliness . and with this he carefully wiped the glasses , spoons and plates . which he put on the table , marguerite could not help smiling to herself as she watched all these preparations . which brogard accomplished to an accompaniment of muttered oaths , clearly the great height and bulk of the englishman . or perhaps the weight of his fist , had overawed this free born citizen of [location] .
he has a bad malignant fever , caught no one can tell how . unless among some poor emigrants whom he met wandering about quite forlorn in a strange city . he understood portuguese and sent them to a proper place when they had told their story . but i fear he has suffered for his kindness . for this fever came on rapidly , and before he knew what it was i was there .
carrigan found that he could peer between his pack and the rock to where the other warbler was singing . and where his enemy lay watching for the opportunity to kill , it was taking a chance . if a movement betrayed his loophole , his minutes were numbered . but he had worked cautiously , an inch at a time . and was confident that the beginning of his effort to fight back was , up to the present moment , undiscovered .
alice could not help looking around and catching miss [female] 's eye . miss [female] was standing with her foot on the fender . but was so placed that she could see [female] , she made a slight sign with her head . as much as to say that lady [female] must have no opportunity of writing from the latter place . but she said nothing , then the carriage was announced .
[female] began to hate the very name of pete . she grew angry with [female] also , why could not he guess ? concealment was eating her heart out , the next time she saw [male] . he passed her in the market place on the market day . as she stood by the tipped up gig , selling her butter .
if not joy , hope had come in the morning . and , at any rate , he could be up and be doing , for the late wintry light was stealing down the hill side . and he knew that , although coulson lay motionless in his sleep . it was past their usual time of rising , still , as it was new year 's day . a time of some licence , [male] had mercy on his fellow shopman .
if alexandra had had much imagination she might have guessed what was going on in [female] 's mind . and she would have seen long before what was going on in emil 's , but that . as emil himself had more than once reflected , was alexandra 's blind side . and her life had not been of the kind to sharpen her vision . her training had all been toward the end of making her proficient in what she had undertaken to do .
the blow had fallen , and it was to be borne , inside the letter to herself had been a very small note addressed to [female] . give her the enclosed , crosbie had said in his letter , if you do not now think it wrong to do so . i have left it open , that you may read it . mrs [female] , however , had not yet read it . and she now concealed it beneath her handkerchief .
then king mark took a sword in his hand and came to sir [male] . and called him false traitor , and would have stricken him . but sir [male] ran under his sword . and took it out of his hand , and then the king cried . `` where are my knights and my men ? i charge you slay this traitor . ''
so the winter was getting on , and the days were beginning to lengthen , without bringing with them any of the brightness of hope which usually accompanies the rays of a february sun . mrs. [female] had of course entirely ceased to come to the house . mr. [male] came occasionally , but his visits were addressed to her father . and were confined to the study , mr. [male] spoke of him as always the same . indeed , the very rarity of their intercourse seemed to make mr. [male] set only the higher value on it .
some weeks passed after this conversation before the question of the chaplaincy gathered any practical import for [male] . and without telling himself the reason , he deferred the predetermination on which side he should give his vote . it would really have been a matter of total indifference to him . that is to say , he would have taken the more convenient side , and given his vote for the appointment of [male] without any hesitation . if he had not cared personally for mr. [male] .
blakeney , with much deliberation , finished his plate of soup . drank his glass of wine , and , momentarily , it seemed to marguerite as if he glanced all round the room . `` quite well , thank you , '' he said at last , drily . there was a pause , during which marguerite could watch these two antagonists who . evidently in their minds , were measuring themselves against one another , she could see [female] almost full face where he sat at the table not ten yards from where she herself was crouching .
a man can not fight against himself for long , that deadly enemy is certain to slay . when [male] was six years old his father lay sick of his last sickness . the wife had fallen into habits of intemperance by this time . and stage by stage she had descended to the condition of an utterly degraded woman . there was something to excuse her , she had been disappointed in the great stakes of life .
but very frequently all she could do in the morning , after her late sitting up at night . was to run with the work home , and receive the money from the person for whom it was done . she could not stay often to make purchases of food . but gave up the money at once to her father 's eager clutch . sometimes prompted by a savage hunger it is true .
i promptly pulled up and raised my hat , which , according to the custom of the cowboy country . gave him to understand i was a cowboy from the western cow ranges . he then motioned me to come on , riding up to the cabin he asked me to dismount and we shook hands . he said , when i saw you coming i said to myself that must be a lost cowboy from some of the western cow ranges . i told him i was lost all right .
katharine looked at her again , as if her first glance must have been deluded . for , surely , there must be some outward sign that [female] was talking in an excited . or bewildered , or fantastic manner , no ; she still frowned , as if she sought her way through the clauses of a difficult argument . but she still looked more like one who reasons than one who feels , she had nerved herself to do what some large and imperious instinct demanded her doing . she had been swept on the breast of a wave beyond her reckoning .
the private carriage was only a hired brougham taken by the month . and as to that boy in buttons whom she had lately established . why should she not keep a young servant , and call him a page . if it gave her any comfort to do so ? if mr [organization] had also known that she had lent the fairstairs family fifty pounds to help them through with some difficulty which [male] had encountered with the norwich tradespeople .
she was afraid of miss [organization] , it is disquieting to fulfil a prophecy , however superficially . she was glad to see no watching figure as she drove past the farm . but only little [male] , turning somersaults in the straw . the tragedy began quietly enough , and like many another talk , by the man 's deft assertion of his superiority . [female] heard her arguing with the driver .
at supper time [female] came home much excited , she had been in hot water all the afternoon . the girls had said at lunch time that the manager was angry with bessie . and had discharged her , she found her coat and hat . and had brought them home , the pocketbook was missing . there was only fifteen cents in it ; but [female] was much [female] .
above all , he was responsible for that thing called the tone of the school . and few realise with what passionate devotion a certain type of boy throws himself into this work . home was a faraway country , full of ponies and fishing and shooting . and men visitors who interfered with one 's plans ; but school was the real world . where things of vital importance happened , and crises arose that must be dealt with promptly and quietly .
quite indifferent , and shutting his eyes because he could not bear the daylight in his throbbing eye balls . jude seemed to doze again , [male] took his purse . softly left the room , and putting on her outdoor things went off to the lodgings she and he had quitted the evening before . scarcely half an hour had elapsed ere she reappeared round the corner . walking beside a lad wheeling a truck on which were piled all jude 's household possessions .
i do not know much about his birth , but i believe it was as good as [male] 's . he was not ignorant , or a fool ; -- whereas i rather think [male] was a fool . [organization] had made his own way in the world . but [male] would certainly not have made himself a banker if his father had not been a banker before him . nor could the bank have gone on and prospered had there not been partners there who were better men of business than our friend .
he refused to tell her , he could not explain to her that he was offering up consciously all his happiness to her . and wished , absurdly enough , to pour every possession he had upon the blazing pyre . even his silver and gold , he wished to keep this distance between them . the distance which separates the devotee from the image in the shrine . circumstances conspired to make this easier than it would have been , had they been seated in a drawing room .
this sweetness of sensation pierced through her old desires . and these , like grains of sand under a gust of wind . eddied to and fro in the subtle breath of the perfume which suffused her soul . she opened wide her nostrils several times to drink in the freshness of the ivy round the capitals . she took off her gloves , she wiped her hands .
`` i could not have stood it much longer without you , dicky , '' i whispered , and then , forgetting everything else in the world but our happiness . my husband 's lips met mine in a long kiss of reconciliation . a half choked little cry startled me . and i saw [female] draper get to her feet unsteadily and start for the door .
the darkness was profound for a moment : the lightnings paused . a sort of sinister connivance . the cloud and the sea became one : there was a dull peal . this was followed by a terrible outburst , the frame which formed the front of the barriers was swept away . the fragments of beams were visible in the rolling waters .
but at the time feeling ran strongly against them ; and all means of expressing itself in action being prevented . men brooded sullenly in their own houses , [male] , as the representative of the family . the head of which was now suffering for his deeds in the popular cause . would have met with more sympathy , ay , and more respect than he imagined . as he went along the streets , glancing from side to side .
mrs. [female] had left a home she loved to come at her brother 's urgent call for help to save his boys . the tutor had only a few hours of his position . and thus far his salary seemed the attractive feature , [male] and [male] were too dazed to be natural for a short time . they had been picked up bodily , and carried kicking and screaming to this place . where they had been dressed in plain durable clothing .
mrs. [female] was sorry for what she had said . but it gave [female] pleasure . as it produced a reply from [male] so expressive of confidence in willoughby and knowledge of his intentions . amongst the objects in the scene , they soon discovered an animated one . it was a man on horseback riding towards them .
he looked about him at the swirling chaos outside the rim of light made by his fire and listened to the moaning of the wind over the treetops . beyond the circle of light the dry snow , which crunched like sand under his feet . was lost in ghostly gloom , it was forty degrees below zero . and he was glad , even with this sickness of despair in his heart . that she was not a fugitive with him tonight .
after that she no longer tried to laugh or argue her husband out of his convictions . they were convictions , and therefore unassailable , nor was any insincerity implied in the fact that they sometimes seemed to coincide with hers . there were occasions when he really did look at things as she did . but for reasons so different as to make the distance between them all the greater . life , to mr. [male] , was like a walk through a carefully classified museum .
it was quite at the other end of the house . but i knew my way ; and the light of the unclouded summer moon . entering here and there at passage windows , enabled me to find it without difficulty . an odour of camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when i came near the fever room . and i passed its door quickly , fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me .
[female] said that i was probably right , i lay awake for a long time after i went to bed that night . thinking of [organization] and [female] . as a general rule , i do not concern my head about other people 's affairs . but [organization] was such a helpless creature i could not get her off my mind . twenty years ago [female] had tried to go with [organization] strong .
all this the goggle eyed mate had said in a resentful and melancholy voice , with pauses . to the gentle murmur of the sea , it was for him a bitter sort of pleasure to have a fresh pair of ears . a newcomer , to whom he could repeat all these matters of grief and suspicion talked over endlessly by the band of captain [male] 's faithful subordinates . it was evidently so refreshing to his worried spirit that it made him forget the advisability of a little caution with a complete stranger . but really with mr. [male] there was no danger .
a few days later , when the king sat in hall before the great fire . for it was passing cold and the wintry wind snarled at the windows . the great door was flung open , and into the hall came three men bearing a wounded knight in armour upon his shield . when they had set him down , the knights that were with the king knew him for sir [male] the seneschal . and sir [male] looked sourly about him , and bade those that carried him take him to his pallet and [male] a leech .
vacancies such as these had always been pre occupied long beforehand by ambitious parents . these very four places had been pre occupied , but now they were all vacant , there would be nine empty beds in the school when it met again after the holidays . and the doctor well understood that nine beds remaining empty would soon cause others to be emptied . it is success that creates success . and decay that produces decay , gradual decay he knew that he could not endure .
[male] noticed the amusement in his eyes when [male] . reddening , said to him : `` will you have some more bread and butter , [male] ? '' it seemed to be tacitly understood afterwards that [female] and her father would attend chapel . while [male] and [male] kept house . no one was ingenious enough to detect an impropriety in the arrangement .
the rumbling thither in the cab after the stillness of the water seemed long . happily his charge had been quiet since her fit of weeping , and submitted like a tired child . when they were in the cab , she laid down her hat and tried to rest her head . but the jolting movement would not let it rest . still she dozed , and her sweet head hung helpless .
but it was too late , the study door flew open . the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold , joy put strength into the feeble limbs . and beth ran straight into her father 's arms . never mind what happened just after that , for the full hearts overflowed , washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present . it was not at all romantic , but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again .
but thus time went , and it was nearly five in the morning before i bade them farewell and mounted my horse . they took theirs and led them away to the stables behind the lodge . i waved my hand and galloped off on my return to the castle . day was dawning , and the air was fresh and pure . the new light brought new hope ; fears seemed to vanish before it .
there was nothing to be said against poor [female] pope . only this , that she had been in [female] 's house on the night of the murder . and had for awhile been suspected by the police of having communicated to her lover the tidings of the farmer 's box of money . evil things had of course been said of her then , but the words spoken of her had been proved to be untrue . she had been taken from the farmer 's house into that of the vicar .
`` i will guarantee that , '' said the duchess , whereupon the duke laughed . and then left her , the duchess had spoken with absolute truth when she told her husband that she had not said a word to mr. lopez about [male] . but it was not long before she did say a word . on that same day she found herself alone with him in the garden . or so much alone as to be able to speak with him privately , he had certainly made the best use of his time since he had been at the castle .
`` he 's gone up by the hoist , '' said the sergeant . running up the ladder in the corner to the next floor . and elevating the light just in time to see [male] 's suspended figure ascending in the same way through the same sort of trap into the second floor . the second trap also fell together behind him , and he was lost to view as before . it was more difficult to follow now ; there was only a flimsy little ladder .
such a wound as that received by [female] was one from which recovery could not be quick . and it was felt by all the family that a weight was upon them which made gaiety impracticable . as for [female] herself it may be said that she bore her misfortune with all a woman 's courage . for the first week she stood up as a tree that stands against the wind . which is soon to be shivered to pieces because it will not bend , during that week her mother and sister were frightened by her calmness and endurance .
early in the winter the glennards took possession of the little house that was to cost them almost nothing . the change brought glennard the immediate relief of seeing less of his wife . and of being protected , in her presence , by the multiplied preoccupations of town life . alexa , who could never appear hurried , showed the smiling abstraction of a pretty woman to whom the social side of married life has not lost its novelty . glennard , with the recklessness of a man fresh from his first financial imprudence .
many a time , nevertheless , during the evening she despaired of fate and of herself . she did not invoke god , we very well know . but she had faith in the genius of evil . that immense sovereignty which reigns in all the details of human life . and by which , as in the arabian fable , a single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world .
while waiting with her baby in her arms for the hotel boy to call her cab . she observed another lady , young and graceful , enter a cab . and a maid following her wearing a pretty cap , and carrying a child . eager , for [female] 's sake . to draw no adverse comment upon herself , she took note of everything .
now , at least , she could not say that she did not understand , if the question was ever asked plainly . [male] had asked it plainly , shall we be man and wife ? few men , i fancy . dare to put it all at once in so abrupt a way . and yet i do not know that the english language affords any better terms for the question .
they had been asked before mrs. [male] 's call had been made . or , i fear , their chance of coming to the party would have been small . there was one young [male] , a man very terrible in his vulgarity . loud , rampant , conspicuous with villainous jewellery , and odious with the worst abominations of perfumery . he was loathsome even to the [male] girls .
father 's business , which has very much increased lately , and business . which we think of starting elsewhere , it has very much increased lately , and we expect next year to keep a extra couple of horses , we have already our eye on one . brown as a berry , neck like a rainbow . fifteen hands , and not a gray hair in her -- offered [female] at twenty five want a crown .
he cried , `` or you are a dead man ! '' the musket fell from the soldier 's hands . who yielded on the instant , [male] summoned one of his grooms . and delivering the prisoner into his charge , with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape . he leaped from his horse and approached [male] .
well ; -- i have , i should have said it before . only that that other man was here , he was blushing now , -- up to the roots of his hair . and felt that he was in a difficulty , there are men . to whom such moments of their lives are pleasurable , but [male] burgess was not one of them . he would have been glad to have had it done and over , -- so that then he might take pleasure in it .
she gazed about her on all sides , not a single passer-by . the quay was absolutely deserted , she heard no sound . she felt no people moving save in the tumultuous and glowing city . from which she was separated only by an arm of the seine . and whence her name reached her .
a chaise cart , driven by a boy , came clattering along the road . and seated in it , in a chair , with a large well saturated umbrella spread out to dry behind her . was the plump figure of a matronly woman , with her bare arms folded across a basket which she carried on her knee . several other baskets and parcels lying crowded around her . and a certain bright good nature in her face and contented awkwardness in her manner .
in the meantime trevelyan was roaming about the station moodily by himself . and the place is one not apt to restore cheerfulness to a moody man by any resources of its own . when the time for departure came mr. [male] sought him and found him . but trevelyan had chosen a corner for himself in a carriage . and declared that he would rather avoid the ladies for the present , `` do not think me uncivil to leave you , ''
amid the hardships and scant diversions of this life . [male] spent his first winter in the bad lands . drinking in the noisy revels at misery . riding the long , bitter miles back to the ranch , despising himself for being so mean and low . it was a life in which a man 's soul would either shrink to nothing or expand until it became too large to find contentment within the horizon of such an existence .
whilst the unknown was viewing these lights with interest . and lending an ear to the various noises , master cropole entered his apartment . followed by two attendants , who laid the cloth for his meal . the stranger did not pay them the least attention . but cropole approaching him respectfully , whispered , [male] .
`` yes , i have them , '' she answered promptly . rising and standing with her arms thrust down and her fingers threaded , while [female] sat still . she had expected the topic , and made her resolve about it . but she meant to carry out her resolve , if possible , without exasperating him . during the hours of silence she had longed to recall the words which had only widened the breach between them .
cutting corners -- the words began to fall apart , forming curious phrasings . little illuminated pieces of themselves , they resolved into sentences . each of which had a strangely familiar ring , cutting corners meant rejecting the old childhood principles that success came from faithfulness to duty . that evil was necessarily punished or virtue necessarily rewarded -- that honest poverty was happier than corrupt riches . this phrase appealed to him and he repeated it over and over .
there was worse than this , as time went on , the first impulse of gratitude and admiration that he had felt towards mr. [male] died away . he came to brood more and more on what had passed while he was a prisoner . he was possessed not only by a haunting dread of rupert of hentzau . at whose hands he had suffered so greatly , but also by a morbid . half mad jealousy of mr. [male] .
d'artagnan took the letter , touched his hat with his hand . turned round upon his heel like a drill sergeant , and a moment afterward was heard . in his dry and monotonous tone , commanding four men and an escort . a carriage and a horse , five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard .
madame [female] villefort made no further reply . her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who . from the first instant she saw him . had made so powerful an impression on her , during the evident preoccupation of madame [male] villefort . monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms .
he had been working at [male] the day the new music teacher had come . and what crooked [male] could not find out about any person in one whole day . at least as far as outward life went -- was hardly worth finding out , next to discovering things did he love telling them . and it would be hard to say which enjoyed that ensuing half hour more -- crooked [female] or the old lady . crooked [female] 's account , boiled down , amounted to this ; both miss gray 's parents had died when she was a baby .
he simply transferred his estimating to the forest by the stream . once he met one of the men ; but was fortunately in a country that lent itself to his pose of hunter . the other he did not see at all , but one day he heard him . the two up river men were following carefully but noisily the bed of a little creek . [male] happened to be on the side hill , so he seated himself quietly until they should have moved on down .
he therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the dauphin d'or . there he ascertained that the bracieux estate was four leagues distant . but that [male] was not at bracieux , [male] had . in fact , been involved in a dispute with the bishop of noyon in regard to the pierrefonds property . which adjoined his own , and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his comprehension .
the instant her son approached mrs. [female] . madame mere grew anxious , and leaving octavia to her friends and lover . she watched [female] , but her surveillance availed little . for she could neither see nor hear anything amiss , yet could not rid herself of the feeling that some mutual understanding existed between them . when the party broke up for the night , she lingered till all were gone but her son and nephew .
when a girl of the same caste , and a virgin . is married in accordance with the precepts of holy writ . the results of such an union are : the acquisition of dharma and artha . offspring , affinity , increase of friends . and untarnished love , for this reason a man should fix his affections upon a girl who is of good family .
we are taking portraits now ; we shall be allowed . therefore , we hope , to sketch the two last of this chapter , the one who was leaning in the chair . that is to say , the joyous , laughing one -- was a beautiful girl of from eighteen to twenty . with brown complexion and brown hair , splendid , from eyes which sparkled beneath strongly marked brows . and particularly from her teeth , which seemed to shine like pearls between her red coral lips .
here lived , with his wife and child , a species of town bandit . a man who had been clerk to an attorney practising at the châtelet . he figured somewhat later at the assize court ; the name of this family was rantaine . on a mahogany chest of drawers in the old house were two [location] cups . ornamented with flowers , on one of which appeared , in gilt letters , the words .
the houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of the wine shop . the large barricade , and the flag from him . then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post . folded his arms , and fell to thinking about his father , he said to himself that his day had also come now . that his hour had struck , that following his father , he too was about to show himself brave .
came a whistle from the distance , the breast of an engine was descried . and a long train curving after it . under a flight of smoke , it grew and grew . louder and louder , its noise foreran it . it became a furious , enormous monster , and , with an instinct for safety .
the chamber seemed to swim round before our hero 's eyes . mr. [male] was still going on with his clear , loud , unpleasant voice . but there was no knowing how long he might go on , upon [male] , if he should now consent . might devolve the duty , within ten minutes , within three minutes . of rising there before a full house to defend his great friend , mr. [male] .
[male] was the only child of a man of large property . who , at the age of eighteen , left her independent [female] of an unincumbered income of seven hundred a year . she was a girl of a lively disposition . and humane , susceptible heart : she resided in [location] with an uncle . who loved her too well , and had too high an opinion of her prudence .
the plan worked very well , the competition for the places was hot . the conductor of the 4.33 express was a duke . there was not a passenger conductor on the line below the degree of earl . they were good men , every one , but they had two defects which i could not cure . and so had to wink at : they would not lay aside their armor , and they would `` knock down ''
to save an unhappy jewess from drowning herself , would not have seemed a startling variation among police reports . but to discover in her so rare a creature as [female] , was an exceptional event which might well bring exceptional consequences . [male] would not let himself for a moment dwell on any supposition that the consequences might enter deeply into his own life . the image of [female] had never yet had that penetrating radiation which would have been given to it by the idea of her loving him . when this sort of effluence is absent from the fancy a man may go far in devotedness without perturbation .
but the last was impossible , mrs. [female] would not hear of the old gentleman 's undertaking the long journey . yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it . for anxiety ill fits one for traveling , he saw the look . knit his heavy eyebrows , rubbed his hands , and marched abruptly away , saying he would be back directly . no one had time to think of him again till .
biscarrat remained silent , `` tell us , or die ! '' cried the wounded man , raising himself upon one knee . and lifting towards his companion an arm bearing a useless sword . [male] rushed towards him . opening his breast for the blow , but the wounded man fell back not to rise again .
after this the householder , having put on his clothes and ornaments . should , during the afternoon , converse with his friends . in the evening there should be singing , and after that the householder , along with his friend . should await in his room , previously decorated and perfumed , the arrival of the woman that may be attached to him . or he may send a female messenger for her , or go for her himself .
a rather long legged young man , in canvas puttees . a buoyant and irrepressible light in his face which the fatigues and disappointments of the long road had not dimmed . a light haired man , with his hat pushed back from his forehead . and a speckled shirt on him , and trousers rather tight . that was what the camp cook saw .
is there in the life of man a more delightful moment than that of a first rendezvous ? are the sensations then hidden at the bottom of our hearts and finding their first expression ever renewed ? can we feel again the nameless pleasures that we felt when . like [male] briere , we looked up our sharpest razors . our finest shirt , an irreproachable collar , and our best clothes ?
it occurred to her that her husband should have taken lunch with her . but he was generally so hurried at noon , she told [female] all about him . he was a little smaller than [male] , but , oh , much better looking . he was a book keeper and not making a lot of money . but they were very happy and expected to be rich within three or four years .
captain arundel went back into the hall . and summoned [female] , the woman replied with rather a sulky air to his numerous questions . but she told him that miss [female] had left her ball dress upon the bed . and had put on a gray cashmere dress trimmed with [female] ribbon . which she had worn as half mourning for her father .
there was no light in the room , and hardly more than a spark of fire showed itself in the grate . the father was sitting on one side of the hearth . in an old arm chair , and there he had sat for the last hour without speaking . his daughter had been in and out of the room , and had endeavoured to gain his attention now and again by a word . but he had never answered her , and had not even noticed her presence .
the conviction that a trap had been laid for me . and the vexation of knowing that i had fallen into it . fortunately restrained me from making my position still worse by an unavailing struggle with two men . one of whom would , in all probability , have been more than a match for me single handed . i repressed the first natural movement by which i had attempted to shake them off .
for the rest , mischievous and inclement as the rain had been , he had contrived to derive some benefit from it . he had in part replenished his stock of fresh water . but his thirst was inextinguishable , and he emptied his can as fast as he filled it . one day -- it was on the last day of april or the first of may . all was at length ready for his purpose .
she added , informed [male] that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow . and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . he acknowledged the truth of it all . and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . `` they will join me early tomorrow , ''
all young girls , romantic or otherwise , can imagine the impatience in which [female] lived for the next few days . the air was full of tongues of fire . the trees were like a plumage , she was not conscious of a body . she hovered in space , the earth melted away under her feet . full of admiration for the post office , she followed her little sheet of paper on its way .
adele and i had now to vacate the library . it would be in daily requisition as a reception room for callers . a fire was lit in an apartment upstairs . and there i carried our books , and arranged it for the future schoolroom . i discerned in the course of the morning that thornfield hall was a changed place .
of course i could stay if i chose , papa would not refuse to find a home for me here . but i do agree with mr. [male] that something should be done to stop the tongues of ill conditioned people . the idea of having my name dragged through the newspapers is dreadful to me . but if this must be done one way or the other , it will be better that it should be done with truth . there is nothing that i need fear .
the valley of the stour is beyond , unaccountable stream . dirty at blandford , pure at wimborne . the stour , sliding out of fat fields , to marry the avon beneath the tower of christchurch . the valley of the avon -- invisible , but far to the north the trained eye may see clearbury ring that guards it . and the imagination may leap beyond that on to salisbury plain itself , and beyond the plain to all the glorious downs of [location] .
would not all these names , including her own , be blazoned to the world in the columns of the next day 's morning post ? there was no absolute danger here , as lady [male] knew ; and lady [male] . who was tolerant and begrudged nothing to madame [organization] except the one thing . was quite willing to meet the lady at such a grand affair as this , but the duke . even should he become ever so childish a child in his old age .
mrs. mosscrop smythe glanced significantly at [organization] , who , however , was too occupied in watching patricia with hawk like intentness to be conscious of anything but the quarry . suddenly patricia remembered , and her face changed , the flowers faded , the chocolates lost their sweetness and the smile vanished . the parted lips set in a firm but mobile line . what had before been a tribute now became in her eyes an insult . men sent chocolates and flowers to .
letting her have the last word of it i stood in the court . and wondered awhile at the glory of the harvest moon . and the yellow world it shone upon , then i saw . as sure as ever i was standing there in the shadow of the stable , i saw a short wide figure glide across the foot of the courtyard . between me and the six barred gate , instead of running after it .
on the next morning , at the appointed hour , lady [female] walked down to the doctor 's house . she never walked about the village without making some little disturbance among the inhabitants . with the squire , himself , they were quite familiar . and he could appear and reappear without creating any sensation ; but her ladyship had not made herself equally common in men 's sight . therefore , when she went in at the doctor 's little gate .
so they wrestled swiftly , rapturously , intent and mindless at last . two essential white figures working into a tighter closer oneness of struggle . with a strange , octopus like knotting and flashing of limbs in the subdued light of the room . a tense white knot of flesh gripped in silence between the walls of old brown books . now and again came a sharp gasp of breath , or a sound like a sigh .
in the white wool robe she wore . the kind of loose dressing gown affected by turkish women . she looked more like a circassian than an [female] girl . always she had seemed to her would be rescuers a charming doll . a feminine thing of exactly the type which would appeal to a turk .
he could not ask where she lived , for he did not know her name . nothing but [female] , and they had called her bessie . he could not go from house to house asking for a girl named bessie . they would think him a fool . as he was , for not finding out her name , her precious name , at once .
sir [male] would quit kellynch hall . and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision . the great question of whither he should go was settled . and the first outline of this important change made out , there had been three alternatives . [location] , bath , or another house in the country .
i will not continue the conversation , although they did a little longer . [organization] 's father had been a preacher among the followers of whitefield . and [organization] was a follower of her father . she laid hold upon the garment of a hard master . a tyrannical god , happy he who has learned the gospel according to jesus .
he was no common rogue ; i felt the quality in him with a certain admiration for his scoundrelly talents— a fellow . i reflected , who was best studied at the point of a pistol . i continued at his heels , and poked the muzzle of the revolver against his back from time to time to keep him assured of my presence . —a device that i was to regret a second later . we were about ten yards from the end of the corridor when he flung himself backward upon me .
the family gathering broke up , each going his way . and [male] returned to his sister 's house . he wanted to get out of the city quickly , gave business as an excuse to avoid lunching with any one . and caught the earliest train back to [location] , as he rode he meditated . when [male] returned to his home , after the funeral , [male] saw at once that something was amiss with him .
fool that i am , i can scarcely hold the pen with which i write to you of this wild dream of my heart . whatever happens , i loved you well , armand , and i would have died long ago if i had not had the memory of your love to help me and a sort of vague hope of seeing you beside me again . the comte [male] g. has returned . his [male] has been unfaithful to him , he is very sad . he was very fond of her , he came to tell me all about it .
this room was not frequented by the young people at night . there were two or three elderly people in the party , notably the husband and the brother of the lady of the house . and to their use the room was more or less given up after nightfall , [male] wished to show me the cabinet where the box had been . there was a fire in the grate , for the evenings were now more or less chilly . when the door had closed behind [male] we found that this same fire made all the light there was in the room .
for any sake hurry back , make an excuse to leave your pilgrims the minute you get this . and take the first train to [location] , surely the late conductor can be your understudy . and trot the people round [location] for a day ? we need you more than they do . i picture you reading this early in the morning .
the question ceased to be a tea table talk , and became suddenly tragically real for [organization] . there he sat , cheerfully friendly in his sex 's freedom . the man she loved , the one man she cared should unlock the way to the wide world for her imprisoned feminine possibilities . and he seemed regardless that she stifled under his eyes . he made a jest of all this passionate insurgence of the souls of women against the fate of their conditions .
this was a little gate round the corner of the street . well known to [female] both in those brief `` courting days , '' when we came to tea of evenings , and found mrs. [location] and ursula march in the garden watering the plants and tying up the roses . nay , we passed out of it into the same summer parlour . where -- i can not tell if [male] ever knew of the incident , at all events he never mentioned it to me .
he should embrace her first of all in a way she likes most . because it does not last for a long time , he should embrace her with the upper part of his body because that is easier and simpler . if the girl is grown up , or if the man has known her for some time . he may embrace her by the light of a lamp . but if he is not well acquainted with her , or if she is a young girl .
but when i came home in the evening . late and almost weary , there was no annie cooking my supper , nor [female] by the fire reading . nor even little [female] huckaback watching the shadows and pondering . upon this , i went to the girls room , not in the very best of tempers . and there i found all three of them in the little place set apart for annie .
it was liquid , it was alive , again the white eyelid closed upon it for a fraction of a second . and the next moment it was gone , there could be no mistake . the live eye that had been watching him through a hole in the tapestry was gone . the firelight no longer shone on a reflecting surface , and instantly [male] awoke to the terrors of his position . hatch 's warning , the mute signals of the priest .
each table was closely surrounded by its own crowd , made up of players . embryo players , and simple lookers on , so that they could not see much as they walked . but this was not enough for lady [female] , she was anxious to know what these men and women were doing . to see whether the croupiers wore horns on their heads and were devils indeed . to behold the faces of those who were wretched and of those who were triumphant .
the bayou curved like a crescent around the point of land on which [male] folle 's cabin stood . between the stream and the hut lay a big abandoned field . where cattle were pastured when the bayou supplied them with water enough . through the woods that spread back into unknown regions the woman had drawn an imaginary line . and past this circle she never stepped , this was the form of her only mania .
the ideal is nothing but the culminating point of logic . the same as the beautiful is nothing but the summit of the true . artistic peoples are also consistent peoples , to love beauty is to see the light . that is why the torch of [location] , that is to say of civilization . was first borne by [male] , who passed it on to [location] .
she was a remarkable looking woman , well advanced in the sixties . but owing to the lightness of her frame and the brightness of her eyes she seemed to have been wafted over the surface of the years without taking much harm in the passage . her face was shrunken and aquiline , but any hint of sharpness was dispelled by the large blue eyes . at once sagacious and innocent , which seemed to regard the world with an enormous desire that it should behave itself nobly . and an entire confidence that it could do so , if it would only take the pains .
the very last village where i spoke on the subject of my [female] . albeit now without hope , was about a league from the western extremity of the range . in the midst of a high broken country of forest and savannah and many swift streams . near one of these , called the curicay , the village stood , among low scattered trees . a large building , in which all the people , numbering eighteen .
these pages are not the record of my wanderings and my dangers away from home . the motives which led me from my country and my friends to a new world of adventure and peril are known . from that self imposed exile i came back , as i had hoped . prayed , believed i should come back -- a changed man , in the waters of a new life i had tempered my nature afresh . in the stern school of extremity and danger my will had learnt to be strong .
he hesitated , and i had the impression that he felt himself about to yield to a stealing tide of inertia . then , `` thank you -- i will take it , '' he answered shortly , i hoped that this incident might set up some more direct communication between us . frome was so simple and straightforward that i was sure his curiosity about the book was based on a genuine interest in its subject . such tastes and acquirements in a man of his condition made the contrast more poignant between his outer situation and his inner needs .
`` hush , '' said [male] , rising , for mr. [male] had made a little startled movement as he reached the gate and caught sight of her . and now , straw hat in hand , he was coming up the brick walk that led to the veranda . his eyes were fixed upon [male] with an intensity that seemed to affect his breathing . there was a hushedness about him , and [male] . in [male] , watched [male] 's expression and posture take on those little changes that always seemed demanded of her by the approach of a young or youngish man .
molly cried a little , but checked her tears as soon as she remembered how annoyed her father would have been at the sight of them . it was very [female] driving quickly along in the luxurious carriage . through the pretty green lanes , with dog roses and honeysuckles so plentiful and rathe in the hedges . that she once or twice was tempted to ask the coachman to stop till she had gathered a nosegay . she began to dread the end of her little journey of seven miles .
[female] out of his hammock , ran to the window . lifted the sash , leaned out , and recognised it , its four chains supported it . made fast to the bulwarks of a vessel in which . beneath the funnel , he could distinguish a dark mass of irregular outline . [male] , turned his back to the window .
miss stanbury , however , was not so precipitate or uncharitable as to act strongly upon information such as this . before she even said a word to [female] . she made further inquiry , she made very minute inquiry . writing even to her very old and intimate friend mrs. [female] . of lessboro ' , -- writing to that lady a most cautious and guarded letter .
nor are our three horn gypsies , the storm visitors with the dreaming . topaz eyes , spunkless , held in superstitious abhorrence by the rest of the crew . aliens by lack of any word of common speech . nevertheless they are good sailors and are always first to spring into any enterprise of work or peril . they have gone into mr. [male] 's watch .
they were like the almond in the shell of the [male] . like a flame enclosed in a dark lantern , [male] held the left arm of [male] closely pressed to him . they walked with the same step , almost of the same stature . she a trifle taller , twittering in a halfvoice . their figures quite close together ; he would have liked to kiss the little moist round on her veil .
without appetite he ate his breakfast , as he did so he heard voices from a stable yard in the street . he lifted his head and looked out mechanically , a four wheeled dogcart was coming down the archway behind a mettlesome young horse with silver mounted harness . the man driving it was a gorgeous person in a light melton overcoat . one of his spatted feet was on the break , and he had a big cigar between his teeth . it was ross [male] , the last time [male] had seen the man he had fought him for the honour of [male] .
[female] returned to her father 's room . now silent again with the air of that which is not , she took from the table the old silver watch . it went on measuring the time by a scale now useless to its owner . she placed it lovingly in her bosom . and sat down by the bedside , already , through love , sorrow , and obedience .
it was a bad beginning of his visit of happiness that [male] saw him some minutes before he came into her father 's house . she was sitting at the end of the dresser . with the little window blind drawn on one side , in order that she might see the passers-by . in the intervals of reading her bible , which lay open before her , so she watched all the greeting a friend gave [female] . she saw the face of condolence .
you love me , you love me . you are wonderful , we are both wonderful , you and i . well , it is good for you to know i have waited and wished . long before the thing came true , but to see you waiting and wishing . when the thing was true all the time : -- oh , that was the trial !
i was glad we had both got over our excitement and were sitting decorously drinking tea . when the judge drew the greys up to the gate . and we both went out to the kerb to ask him and the lovely long lady to come in . they could not ; but we stood and talked to them long enough for mrs. [female] to get a good look at [female] from across the street . and i was afraid i should find aunt adeline in a faint when i went into the house .
the shock was like that of a suicide , if the disaster had been wilfully sought . it could not have been more terrible , the durande had rushed upon her fate as if she had attacked the rock itself . a point had pierced her sides like a wedge . more than six feet square of planking had gone ; the stem was broken . the prow smashed , and the gaping hull drank in the sea with a horrible gulping noise .
only two things indicated the social condition of [location] . the rabble , that is the poor people , and the price of commodities . an enormous crowd of factory hands . house [male] , and peasants . with whom some officials , seminarists , and gentry were mingled .
this action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on prince vasili 's face so out of keeping with his dignity that [male] stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide . [female] evinced no surprise , she only smiled faintly and sighed . as if to say that this was no more than she had expected , be a man , my friend . i will look after your interests , said she in reply to his look . and went still faster along the passage , [male] could not make out what it was all about .
in such cases the outward presentment easily becomes what the image is to the worshipper . it was not long before the two became aware that each was interesting to the other . but the `` how far '' remained a matter of doubt , [female] did not conceive that miss [female] was likely to think of him as a possible lover . and she was not accustomed to think of herself as likely to stir more than a friendly regard . or to fear the expression of more from any man who was not enamored of her fortune .
on the wrong side of one which miss [female] foot turned up . that filled me with renewed alarms , hastily i laid the rug straight . placed a chair upon it , and persuaded everybody to have tea before inspecting their bedroom tents . while they drank draughts and dabbed jam on an egyptian conception of scones . i hurried like a haggard ghost from tent to tent .
lydgate said to himself that the clergyman whose abilities were so painful to mr. [male] . appeared to have found an agreeable resort in this certainly not erudite household , he could half understand it . the good humor , the good looks of elder and younger . and the provision for passing the time without any labor of intelligence . might make the house beguiling to people who had no particular use for their odd hours .
the analysis of such a nature as hers . with her story to set it forth , would require a book to itself . and i must happily content myself with but a fact here and there in her history . in one of her rambles on his ground she had her desire . and met [male] wardour , he lifted his hat .
at last it became a fact proved to her mind that colonel osborne had been at the clock house . had been received there , and had remained there for hours , -- had been allowed access to mrs. trevelyan . and had slept the night at the inn at lessboro ' . the thing was so terrible to miss stanbury 's mind . that even false hair , [male] , and penny newspapers did not account for it .
he took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom . he had been contented , for the convenience of the house . to lodge in the fourth story ; and truth obliges [male] even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof . his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money . and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table .
its special feature was a foregone family confidence and sympathy . when young [male] appeared at half past one without the ivory hand and waistcoat of golden sprigs . the sun shorn of his beams by disastrous clouds . mr [male] presented him to the yellow haired ruggs as the young man he had so often mentioned who loved miss [male] . `` i am glad , '' said mr [male] , challenging him specially in that character .
even [female] seemed to sense the argument and condemnation that was passing behind mckay 's unsmiling eyes . he did not move , but lay squatted on his belly , with his nose straight out on the ground between his forepaws . it was his attitude of self immolation . his acknowledgment of the other 's right to strike with lash or club . yet in his eyes , bright and steady behind his mop of whiskers .
but such things have their end ; and left to herself in the large , vacant , old apartment . she grew quieter , and at last calm . at length she took the candle and ascended to her bedroom . where she bathed her eyes and looked in the glass to see if she had made herself a dreadful object . it was not so bad as she had expected , and she went downstairs again .
the danger was over in a moment , and he was about to utter his last speech . when the excited young scene shifter , who had flown up a ladder to repair the damage . leaned over to whisper all right ' , and release demi from his spread eagle attitude . as he did so , a hammer slipped out of his pocket . to fall upon the upturned face below , inflicting a smart blow and literally knocking the baron 's part out of his head .
but the owls , and the porcupine , and the fiery eyed fox that had run away from him . had put into [male] something which was not in him yesterday . and he did not slink on his belly when he came to the edge of the cup between the broken ridge . but stood up boldly on his crooked legs and looked ahead of him , at the far edge of the cup . under the western shoulder of the ridge , was a thick scattering of tall cedars and green poplars and white birch .
was she so very exceptionally bad , however ? you who hate your brother or your sister . you do not think yourself at all bad , but you are a murderer . and she was only a murderer , you do not feel wicked ? how do you know she did ? besides , you hate . and she did not hate ; she only wanted to take care of herself .
this little passage came back to him the next morning . as he opened his hotel window on the early roar of the northern terminus . the girl was there , in the room next to him . that had been the first point in his waking consciousness . the second was a sense of relief at the obligation imposed on him by this unexpected turn of everts .
he raised his hand and gently stroked the gleaming hair . but he did not look at her , he gazed out at the garden . which grew dark and dreary in the gathering gloom . his lips were tight set and his face pale and drawn . i watched him for a moment , then i drew my wife away .
however , there was one way she could force mr. [male] into his proper place and save the situation . she could say she herself intended to invite a friend . it was her right , they had all said so . apart from propriety , it was monstrous that mrs. [female] should want to monopolise the one spare room . when in her own room was everything necessary for her husband .
they drew swiftly nearer to the light , for it was not far from the knoll to kedsty 's place . kent 's mind leaped ahead , a little west by north from the inspector 's bungalow was [female] 's bayou and it was undoubtedly to the forest trail over which she had gone at least once before . on the night of the mysterious assault upon mooie . that marette was leading him , questions began to rush upon him now . immediate demanding questions , they were going to the river .
there , nevertheless , we insist upon it , is life . palpitation , human tremor , petty details . as we think we have already said , are , so to speak , the foliage of great events . and are lost in the distance of history , the epoch . surnamed `` of the riots , '' abounds in details of this nature .
a deer -- a tiger , i have forgotten . let me go , he ran off and she sat alone with her doubts and fears . yet triumph coloured them too , she saw a dead woman . a dead child , and herself bending above them . she hid the vessel in her bosom and went out among her women .
very quietly he rose and climbed over the low partition which separated his compartment from that in which the woman was . she was seated in the corner , her head leaning back . so that the feeble light from the lamp fell on it . and her eyes were closed , she was asleep , he slid himself along the seat till he was opposite to her . then paused to look at the fierce wicked face on which drink and paint and years of evil thinking and living had left their marks .
`` i shall never see her more , '' murmured [male] , and he directed his steps towards the door . he laid his hand on the knob . the latch yielded , the door opened , [male] pushed it open far enough to pass through . stood motionless for a second , then closed the door again and turned to marius . he was no longer pale , he was livid .
therefore i left her also ; for [female] would i be eaten myself than have nothing to eat . and so i came back to my old furrier ; the which was a thoroughly hearty man . and welcomed me to my room again , with two shillings added to the rent . in the joy of his heart at seeing me . being under parole to master stickles .
but mounted horsemen were in that case forbidden to assail him . when any knight could force his antagonist to the extremity of the lists . so as to touch the palisade with his person or arms . such opponent was obliged to yield himself vanquished , and his armour and horse were placed at the disposal of the conqueror . a knight thus overcome was not permitted to take farther share in the combat .
there are well-known grand meets in england , in the parks of noblemen . before their houses , or even on what are called their lawns ; but these magnificent affairs have but little of the beauty of which i speak . such assemblies are too grand and too ornate , and , moreover , much too far removed from true sporting proprieties . at them , equipages are shining , and ladies dresses are gorgeous , and crowds of tradesmen from the neighbouring town have come there to look at the grand folk .
after staggering into smolensk which seemed to them a promised land . the french , searching for food , killed one another , sacked their own stores . and when everything had been plundered fled farther , the movements of the russian and french armies during the campaign from [location] back to the niemen were like those in a game of russian blindman 's bluff . in which two players are blindfolded and one of them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his whereabouts . first he rings his bell fearlessly , but when he gets into a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can .
1817 is the year which [female] xviii. . with a certain royal assurance which was not wanting in pride . entitled the twenty second of his reign , it is the year in which [male] bruguiere [male] sorsum was celebrated . all the hairdressers shops , hoping for powder and the return of the royal bird . were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs de lys , it was the candid time at which count lynch sat every sunday as church warden in the church warden 's pew of saint germain des pres .
here within the walls of a destroyed house he disappeared . the place was evidently familiar to him , for he moved without hesitation . broken furniture still stood in the roofless rooms . and in front of a battered bureau [male] paused . still whistling under his breath , he took off his uniform and donned a strange one .
the stakes had been high , the struggle keen . the edge of passion had been sharpened , and the seeds of enmity sown . yet [male] , having struck for the crown , had paid for the blow with his life . should there not then be an end ? [female] was dead , the princess her [female] 's wife . the story in safe keeping , and mr. [male] 's face seen no more in ruritania .
i could only preach and preach , so i mused , and get my effigy burnt for my pains . i had not yet been able to bring back a single soul from the path of death . they who have the power , can do so by a mere sign . my words have not that ineffable meaning , i am not a flame . only a [male] coal , which has gone out , i can light no lamp .
as the horse trotted on , [male] made out something lying in the road which looked . at that distance , like the body of a man . closer approach proved this to be the case , indeed , whether the man was alive or dead . it was impossible to determine from the saddle , but he lay in a huddled heap as if he had been thrown from a horse . his hat in the road some feet beyond .
if he could make her happy again , he did not care , an owl flew . queeking , queeking ; a bat flitted by ; the moonlight brightened and broadened on the water . how long was she going to roam about like this , he went back to the window . and suddenly saw her coming down to the bank , she stood quite close . on the landing stage , and soames watched , clenching his hands .
with my hat long since stripped from my head and launched into darkness and space . my hair lashed about me in all directions . my petticoats twisted round me like ropes . i was utterly and completely bewildered by the thunder and roar of all around . i no longer knew which way i had come nor where to turn .
`` billie the kid '' was another sort of a man and there has never been another man like him and i do not think there ever will be again . writers claim that he was a man all bad . this i doubt as i knew him well and i have known him to do deeds of kindness . he had many traits that go to make a good man . but fate and circumstances were against the kid .
my dear mother , -- do not weep , these tender proofs of affections at length dispelled the grief of [female] tour . she took [female] and [location] in her arms . and , embracing them , said , you are the cause of my affliction . my children , but you are also my only source of delight ! yes , my dear children , misfortune has reached me .
as he paced the deck with a chafed step . vexed at one or two little mistakes on the part of the mate . and suffering himself from the pain of separation from wife and children . but showing his suffering only by his outward irritation , he heard a hail from the shabby little river boat that was striving to overtake his winged ship . for the men fearing that , as the ship was now fairly over the bar .
loder made no answer , moving into the room . he paused by the oak table that stood between the fireplace and the door . they made an unconscious tableau as they stood there . he with his hard , set face , she with her heightened color . her inexplicably bright eyes , they stood completely silent for a space .
now after all my labouring to pay every man to a penny . and to allow the women over , when among the couch grass ( which is a sad thing for their gowns ) . to be charged like this , i say , so amazed me that i stood . with my legs quite open , and ready for an earthquake , and the scornful way in which he said `` sir [male] , '' went to my very heart , reminding me of my littleness .
it was wonderful , again , how she grasped what he was doing in the mills . and saw how his whole scheme hung together , harmonizing the work and leisure of the operatives . instead of treating them as half machine . half man , and neglecting the man for the machine . nor was she content with utopian generalities .
there was a start of surprise in [male] before he could raise his hat and pass on . the moment did not seem to favor any closer greeting , and the circumstances under which they had last parted made him doubtful whether [male] would be civilly inclined to him . as he sat taking his coffee at a convenient angle for observing her . he discerned something which he felt sure was the effect of a secret delight . some fresh ease in moving and speaking , some peculiar meaning in her eyes .
[female] said that the necklace was made , he would answer for it . in [location] , two or three hundred years ago , long before [location] jewellers had begun to meddle with diamonds . and on the gold clasp he found some letters . done in some inverted way , the meaning of which was beyond him . also a bearing of some kind , which he believed was a mountain cat .
she went on writing ; from time to time she tore up what she had written . [organization] softly took a book from the table . and perching herself on a stiff , high chair . bent over it and began to read , imogene sat by the hearth . where a small fire was [female] in the indoor chill of an italian house .
at this moment there was a stir in the other room . the voice of mrs. [female] was heard talking of proof sheets rescued by miraculous providence from butcher 's ledgers in [location] . the curtain separating one room from the other was drawn apart , and mrs. [female] and [female] stood in the doorway . mrs. [female] stopped short , she looked at her daughter . and at the man her daughter was to marry , with her peculiar smile that always seemed to tremble on the brink of satire .
but we loved the science of things . we wished to know , we wished to know about all the things which make the earth around us . we asked so many questions that the teachers forbade it . we think that there are mysteries in the sky and under the water and in the plants which grow . but the council of scholars has said that there are no mysteries .
who can say of a particular sea that it is old ? distilled by the sun . kneaded by the moon , it is renewed in a year . in a day , or in an hour , the sea changed . the fields changed , the rivers , the villages . and the people changed , yet egdon remained , those surfaces were neither so steep as to be destructible by weather .
but [female] 's confidence lay chiefly in herself . she felt well equipped for the mastery of life . with regard to much in her lot hitherto . she held herself rather hardly dealt with , but as to her `` education , '' she would have admitted that it had left her under no disadvantages .
she was very fond of singing , he could sing a little himself . she believed he was very clever , and understood every thing . he had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them . he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country . she believed every body spoke well of him .
his health improved day by day . hour by hour , from the day of his parting from [male] . the low fever had left him before he had been ten days in [location] . the perpetual thirst , the wearisome debility , left him also . he began to be his old self again ; and to him this recovery was far more terrible than the worst possible symptoms of disease could have been .
molly now appeared with the empty basket , and when it had been filled from the heap on the grass . [female] went home with her . bidding [female] a frigid adieu , the same evening . when [female] was absent , the [female] proposed that they should all three go to an upper window of the house . to get a distant view of some rockets and illuminations which were to be exhibited in the town and harbour in honour of the king .
mrs [female] earnestly , for , knowing dan better than anyone else . she saw that her colt was not thoroughly broken yet , and feared while she hoped . knowing that life would always be hard for one like him , she was sure that before he went away again . in some quiet moment he would give her a glimpse of his inner self . and then she could say the word of warning or encouragement that he needed .
but it was , as surgeons say , an inoperable case . so i just gloomed at it and wished i had not let this doctor interpose his plumpness between [male] and [male] . who since that afternoon seemed to me as not only a woman whom it was good to love . but , as a patron saint must appear to a catholic . as an intercessory being whose kindliness could be daunted only by some special and incredibly malicious decision of [organization] .
immediately she felt a rising rage against him mingling with her shame for herself . and the words , `` you might at least have raised your hat to her , '' flew impetuously to her lips -- but did not pass them , if as her husband . in her company , he chose to ignore these creatures whom she herself had excluded from the place she was filling . how could she be the person to reproach him ?
news of the double tragedy had swept through the camp . and there was a crowd in front of the supply house . [female] passed close to [location] 's house to avoid discovery . ran a hundred yards up the trail over which jeanne had fled a short time before . and then cut straight across through the thin timber for the head of the lake .
the girl 's second great discovery was that , so far from having been for mrs. lowder a subject of superficial consideration . the blighted home in [location] had haunted her nights and her days . [female] had spent , all winter , hours of observation that were not less pointed for being spent alone . recent events , which her mourning explained , assured her a measure of isolation . and it was in the isolation above all that her neighbour 's influence worked .
she turned quite pale , even in that light he could see her pallor . and her hands fell heavily on the keys , the echo of the crashing notes rolled round the room and slowly died away . but still she said nothing , `` it is stifling in here , '' she said , `` let [female] go out , '' she rose . took up a shawl that lay beside her on a chair , and stepped through the french window into the garden .
from the foregoing events of the winter time let [female] press on to an october day . more than eight months subsequent to the parting of clare and tess . we discover the latter in changed conditions . instead of a bride with boxes and trunks which others bore . we see her a lonely woman with a basket and a bundle in her own porterage .
in a very short time stone court was cleared of well brewed featherstones and other long accustomed visitors . another stranger had been brought to settle in the neighborhood of middlemarch . but in the case of mr. [male] there was more discontent with immediate visible consequences than speculation as to the effect which his presence might have in the future . no soul was prophetic enough to have any foreboding as to what might appear on the trial of [male] . as to any provincial history in which the agents are all of high moral rank .
in the course of the day , too , [male] looked through the whole house . dull and dark he found it . the gaunt rooms , deserted for years upon years . seemed to have settled down into a gloomy lethargy from which nothing could rouse them again . the furniture , at once spare and lumbering , hid in the rooms rather than furnished them .
if she accepted his love , he felt courageous about all other consequences . and as her betrothed husband he would gain a protective authority which might be a desirable defense for her in future difficulties with her father . [male] had not observed any signs of growing restlessness in [male] . or of diminished desire to recommend himself ; but he had forebodings of some future struggle . some mortification , or some intolerable increase of domestic disquietude in which he might save [male] and [male] from being helpless victims .
all of these would be excellent arguments to use in favour of mr gazebee as a suitor . had his proposals been made to any one in his own rank of life . but you , in considering the matter , should , i think , look on it in a very different light . the very fact that you pronounce him to be so much superior to other attorneys . shows in how very low esteem you hold the profession in general .
[female] gave the open letter to [female] . who at first was unable to comprehend it , but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time . she could scarcely believe in her happiness ; and [female] was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written . and whatever might be -- considering the violent character of [female] -- the danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her [female] . she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her .
why passengers for turin , who reach susa dusty . tired , and sleepy , should be detained at that place for an hour and a half instead of being forwarded to their beds in the great city . is never made very apparent , all travelling officials on the continent of [location] are very slow in their manipulation of luggage . but as they are equally correct we will find the excuse for their tardiness in the latter quality . the hour and a half , however , is a necessity .
the talk among the rest went on unrestrainedly , for nothing [male] 's absorption except shaking the table when he was writing . two letters of the nine had been for [female] , after reading them . she had passed them to her mother . and sat playing with her tea spoon absently , till with a sudden recollection she returned to her sewing . which she had kept on her lap during breakfast .
in cool , fresh weather mrs. [female] would have found no inconvenience in walking to alderworth . but the present torrid attack made the journey a heavy undertaking for a woman past middle age . and at the end of the third mile she wished that she had hired fairway to drive her a portion at least of the distance . but from the point at which she had arrived it was as easy to reach clym 's house as to get home again . so she went on , the air around her pulsating silently .
when the servant opened it the rays of the candle fell upon the form of fairway . at eleven o'clock he went to bed himself . smoked for some time in his bedroom , put out his light at half past eleven . and then , as was his invariable custom , pulled up the blind before getting into bed . that he might see which way the wind blew on opening his eyes in the morning .
for answer she went to him and taking his face in her hands . she kissed him on either cheek and whispered : `` wait till tomorrow ! '' `` i am trying hard to feel happy , '' she answered , `` and harder still to make you feel so as well . '' and then , drawing her chair close to him , she sat down and rested her face against his shoulder . it was one of her odd ways , and it must be now stated that when this winsome girl most earnestly desired to reach her father 's heart .
he had never felt satisfied to become a farmer like his father . but what else to apply himself to he had no idea . he knew this was to be his last term at the academy . and that he must then turn his attention to some real occupation in life . he had been in the habit of calling upon liddy nearly every sunday evening for the past year .
low and covered with brown tiles , there hung outside it . beneath the dormer window of the garret , a string of onions . faggots upright against a thorn fence surrounded a bed of lettuce . a few square feet of lavender , and sweet peas strung on sticks . dirty water was running here and there on the grass , and all round were several indefinite rags .
like a tawny ribbon trailed upon the green , the road wound down the hill . she followed it until she reached the side path on the right . and went down into the woods , the great boughs arched over her head like the nave of a cathedral . and the little people of the forest , in feathers and fur . scattered as she approached , bright eyes peeped at her from behind tree trunks .
how well he knew [female] , as she sat there . erect and silent and somewhat bemused , and yet so potent , so powerful , he knew her statically . so finally , that it was almost like a madness , it was difficult to believe one was not mad . that one was not a figure in the hall of kings in some egyptian tomb . where the dead all sat immemorial and tremendous , how utterly he knew [male] , who was talking in his harsh .
i that was a great fortune , and passed for such , was above being asked how much my estate was . and my false friend taking it upon a foolish hearsay . had raised it from # 500 to # 5000 , and by the time she came into the country she called it , 15,000 . the irishman , for such i understood him to be , was stark mad at this bait . in short , he courted me , made me presents .
the appointment was one certainly not popular with any of the prime minister 's friends . with some , such as lord drummond , it indicated a determination on the part of the duke to declare his freedom from all those bonds which had hitherto been binding on the heads of government . had the duke selected himself , certainly no offence would have been given . had the marquis of [male] been the happy man . excuses would have been made , but it was unpardonable to lord drummond that he should have been passed over and that the garter should have been given to lord earlybird .
this time it was not a murmur but a low thunder of voice that answered . [male] and [male] forged ahead to his side . shoulder to shoulder they led the way . from the camp at the forks it was eighteen miles to the devil 's nest . where hung on the edge of a chasm the log buildings that sheltered [male] and his crew .
he was never a racing engineer . and took special pride in saying as much before the liverpool men ; but he had a thirty two years knowledge of machinery and the humours of ships . one side of his face had been wrecked through the bursting of a pressure gauge in the days when men knew less than they do now . and his nose rose grandly out of the wreck , like a club in a public riot .
it was late before [female] laid herself down by her sister 's side that night . `` carry , '' she whispered when her sister was undressed . `` will you kneel here and say your prayers as you used to ? '' carry , without a word , did as she was bidden . and hid her face upon her hands in her sister 's lap .
well , i reckon you ai not , you are jes goin to take a snack right here . [female] hesitated , but the little girl was looking at him with such unconscious eagerness in her dark eyes that he sat down again . `` all right , i will , thank you . '' at once she ran to the kitchen and the old man rose and pulled a bottle of white liquid from under the quilts . `` i reckon i can trust ye , '' he said .
the stone was always rolling back upon the labourer ; the water was perpetually pouring out of the perforated buckets . he cultivated the working man , and founded a club for him . where he might have lectures upon geology and astronomy . and where , after twelve hours bricklaying or road making . he might improve his mind with the works of stuart mill or [organization] .
the archdeacon certainly had no longer any doubt as to lady lufton 's innocence when he looked at her face as she heard these tidings . she had predicted that [female] crawley would `` make havoc , '' and could not , therefore , be altogether surprised at the idea that some gentleman should have fallen in love with her . but she had never supposed that the havoc might be made so early in her days . or on so great a quarry , you do not mean to tell me that [female] grantly is in love with [female] crawley ? ', she replied .
brilliant in blue and gold the dawn opened over the capital . scarcely a breath of wind rippled the warm clear air of the spring morning . a morning designed for a country bridal among the scented fields or the waking of wild furry creatures in the woods . and which man was seizing for such different use , from the first deafening salute of cannon that ushered in the emperor 's seventeenth birthday . the city was in a tumult indescribable , cavalry officers galloped through the swarming .
but it is so sadly out of repair as to be altogether unfit for the residence of a gentleman and his family . it stands not in a park , for the land about it is divided into paddocks by low stone walls . but in the midst of lovely scenery , the ground rising all round it in low irregular hills or fells . and close to it , a quarter of a mile from the back of the house . there is a small dark lake , not serenely lovely as are some of the lakes in westmorland .
as the boat ascended on a sea , her feet touched and i released her hands . i cast off the tackles and leaped after her , i had never rowed in my life . but i put out the oars and at the expense of much effort got the boat clear of the ghost . then i experimented with the sail , i had seen the boat steerers and hunters set their spritsails many times . yet this was my first attempt , what took them possibly two minutes took me twenty .
baldos went alone and swiftly , the note to colonel quinnox had been imperative , he was to serve as an inner guard until further orders . someone , it was reported , had tried to enter miss [organization] 's room from the outside during the rainstorm of the previous night . and a special guard was to be stationed near the door , all of this was unknown to baldos . but he did not ask for any explanations , he was half way to the castle when the sharp report of a gun startled him . a bullet whizzed close to his ear , baldos broke into a crouching run .
doubly , however , she rejoiced at the generosity of mr rupil . as it rendered wholly unnecessary her further interference : for she now saw with some alarm the danger to which benevolence itself . directed towards a youthful object , might expose her , [female] returned home so late . that she was summoned to the dining parlour the moment she entered the house . her morning dress , and her long absence .
for them , the idea of the man is not separated from the idea of darkness . the night is called [male] sorgue . man , l'orgue , man is a derivative of the night . they have taken up the practice of considering society in the light of an atmosphere which kills them . of a fatal force , and they speak of their liberty as one would speak of his health .
at breakfast , and during the walk to church . fenwick said not a word to his friend about bullhampton . he talked of church services . of ritual , of the quietness of a sunday in [location] . and of the sunday occupations of three millions of people not a fourth of whom attend divine service .
i really have a regard for him , he is so easily imposed upon ! the house is a good one , the furniture fashionable , and everything announces plenty and elegance . [male] is very rich i am sure ; when a man has once got his name in a banking house he rolls in money . but they do not know what to do with it , keep very little company . and never go to [location] but on business , we shall be as stupid as possible .
ranks of beautiful vetches and purple lupines . escholtzias , like immense sweeps of golden sunlight ; wild sweet peas . trumpet shaped blossoms whose name no one knew . all flung broadcast over the face of the land . and in such stintless quantities that it dazzled the mind to think of as it did the eyes to behold them .
a gentleman from the beginning , and a gentleman to the end . what the devil , a gentleman must be waited on , i hope ? it 's a part of my character to be waited on ! he half filled the tumbler as he said it . and drank off the contents when he had done saying it .
the mountain village of yacoua had no suburbs . no outlying houses , the one story mud huts with their pointed red roofs . utterly unlike arab dwellings , were huddled together , with only enough distance between for a man and a mule or a donkey to pass . the best stood in pairs , with a walled yard between . and as [male] and nevill searched anxiously for some one to point out the home of mouni .
she would go away somewhere , and live as best she might upon her jointure . it was not very much , but it would be sufficient , she did not see . she said , how she could live with her sister . because she did not wish to be dependent , [female] , of course . would live in a style to which she could make no pretence .
it was a long table , having , of course . four corners , and at the corner appropriated by them they were partly opposite to the man who dealt the cards . the corner answering to theirs at the other end was the part of the table most removed from their sight . and that on which their eyes fell last , as lady [female] stood she could hardly see . indeed , at first she could not see , -- one or two who were congregated at this spot .
[female] smiled happily ; but [female] looked alarmed , lady tanagra went over to her and bending down kissed her lightly on the cheek . [female] looked up , and [female] saw that her eyes were suspiciously moist . with a murmured apology about a note he was expecting he left the room . that night the three dined at the quadrant , `` to get to know each other , '' as lady tanagra said , when [female] reached galvin house .
come , [female] , girls never notify the family in advance when they plan elopements . it 's not done , [female] is right , [female] will bring her to her senses . he has a deep religious nature , if you offer yourself on such terms to the man who loves you honorably . he will never look at you again , except that you deserted me . dear , just when i needed you most , [male] , [male] !
he put his guns away , and was seized suddenly with a desire to disregard his blindness . to pretend that it was no hindrance and to pretend so hard that it should prove not to be one . the desire grew and shook him like a passion and carried him winged out of the countries of dim stars straight to the east . the smell of the east and its noises and the domes of its mosques . the hot sun , the rabble in its streets , and the steel blue sky overhead .
i do not understand her wishing to conceal her visit to this place from sir [female] 's knowledge . and i do not feel half so sure , as the housekeeper seems to do . that her daughter [male] is not in the neighbourhood after all . what would [male] have said in this emergency ? poor , dear [male] ! i am beginning to feel the want of his honest advice and his willing help already .
but he found himself wholly mistaken , mrs. [male] was sorry to say that the little girl 's staying with them . at least as things then were , was quite out of the question , poor mr. [male] 's indifferent state of health made it an impossibility . he could no more bear the noise of a child than he could fly . if , indeed , he should ever get well of his gouty complaints . it would be a different matter : she should then be glad to take her turn .
i could catch glimpses of the ravages of the storm raging over this . behind the scenes , all i can say is , that nikhil is a curious creature . quite out of the common , the upshot was , that after this bee began to send for me to the sitting room . for a chat , without any contrivance , or pretence of its being an accident . thus from bare suggestion we came to broad hint .
if she did not -- as amherst afterward recalled -- put all this specifically into words . she contrived to convey it in her manner . in her allusions , above all in her recovered composure , she had the demeanour of one who has gone through a severe test of strength . but come out of it in complete control of the situation . there was something slightly unnatural in this prompt solution of so complicated a difficulty .
the tale of mrs. lowder 's disgust at her elder niece 's marriage to mr. [male] had lost little of its point . the incredibly fatuous behaviour of mr. [male] . the parson of a dull suburban parish . with a saintly profile which was always in evidence , being so distinctly on record to keep criticism consistent . he had presented his profile on system .
as the rogue sat , ever and again nodding himself off his balance . his recovery was always attended by an angry stare and growl . as if , in the absence of any one else , he had aggressive inclinations towards himself . in one of these starts the cry of `` lock , ho ! lock ! '' prevented his relapse into a doze , shaking himself as he got up like the surly brute he was .
`` do promise , do promise , vasili , '' cried [male] as he went . with the smile of a coquettish girl , which at one time probably came naturally to her . but was now very ill suited to her careworn face , apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts . but as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold , artificial expression . she returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking .
who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march . and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion ? we know not , who does know ? himself , perhaps , however , gavroche was well up in all the popular tunes in circulation . and he mingled with them his own chirpings . an observing urchin and a rogue , he made a potpourri of the voices of nature and the voices of [location] .
the [male] 's man attended to mrs. [female] 's piece of the garden as well as to the larger portion . digging , planting , and weeding indifferently in both , the [male] observing with reason that it was not worth while for a helpless widow lady to hire a man for her little plot when his man . working alongside , could tend it without much addition to his labour . the two households were on this account even more closely united in the garden than within the mill . out there they were almost one family , and they talked from plot to plot with a zest and animation which mrs. [female] could never have anticipated when she first removed thither after her husband 's death .
helen , who had been glad to get back to the moraine during the ascent . was ready to breathe a sigh of relief when she felt her feet on the ice again . those treacherous rocks were affrighting , they bereft her of trust in her own limbs . she seemed to slip here and there without power to check herself . she expected at any moment to stumble helplessly on some cruelly sharp angle of a granite boulder .
those nearest the piano -- and nobody more quickly than [male] hubbard . now observed that the white face of the man on the stool had grown whiter still . his eyes gazed out glassily from under his damp brow . he looked like a man who was seeing some ghastly sight , the audience sympathised with him . they felt like that , too , there was a rustle at [location] 's side as [male] hubbard rose and followed him .
she had seated herself a little away from him . and he did not attempt to draw near to her again till at her bidding he rose to leave her . he sat there for nearly an hour , and during that time much more was said by her than by him . she endeavoured to make him understand that he was as free as air . and that she would hope some day to hear that he was married .
and therein lay a temptation that sat closer at his side -- the temptation to turn his face and fly away . it was midnight , the moon was shining on the boundless plain of the sea . he was in the slack water of the soul . when the ebb is spent , before the tide has begun to flow , oh , to leave everything behind . the shame and the glory together , it was the moment when the girls on [male] quay were pulling the rope for the men on the boats who were ready to vote for [male] .
ruth : one moment , let me tell you who they are . they are no members of the common throng . they are all noblemen who have gone wrong , all : they are all noblemen who have gone wrong . general : no englishman unmoved that statement hears . because , with all our faults , we love our house of peers .
an answer came so quickly that it startled him . not one voice , but two -- three -- and one of them the shrill agonized cry of a woman . they came toward him as he continued to shout . until a few feet away he could make out a gray blur moving through the gloom . he went to it , staggering under the weight of the man he had found in the snow .
thus andre louis to himself in his self contempt , and whilst he trifled away his time and played scaramouche . and centred all his hopes in presently becoming the rival of such men as chenier and mercier . [male] tour d'azyr went his proud ways unchallenged and wrought his will . it was idle to tell himself that the seed he had sown was bearing fruit . that the demands he had voiced in nantes for the third estate had been granted by [male] .
whether it really was will -- more potent than the bark of barks and wiser than the physicians . or merely the vis medicatrix with which nature helps our weakness even when the will is suspended . that saved me i can not say ; but it is certain that i gradually recovered health . physical and mental , and finally reached the coast comparatively well , although my mind was still in a gloomy . desponding state when i first walked the streets of georgetown .
it had not seemed to matter to her before if he were a fool or no . but now , just where they were , she liked his not being ; and it was all moreover none the worse for coming back to something of the same sound as mrs. lowder 's so recent reminder . she too wished to take care of her -- and was not it . à peu près what all the people with the kind eyes were wishing ? once more things melted together -- the beauty and the history and the facility and the splendid midsummer glow .
she could not , as yet , bear to think deliberately of darrow ; but she kept on repeating to herself `` by and bye that will come too . '' even now she was determined not to let his image be distorted by her suffering . as soon as she could , she would try to single out for remembrance the individual things she had liked in him before she had loved him altogether . no `` spiritual exercise '' devised by the discipline of piety could have been more torturing . but its very cruelty attracted her , she wanted to wear herself out with new pains ...
people expected that [female] would surely show herself in her mourning at meeting the sunday after the squire died . but she did not , moreover , it began to be gradually discovered that she never went out in the village street nor crossed the boundaries of her own domains after her father 's death . she lived in the great house with her three servants . a man and his wife , and the woman who had been with her mother when she died . then it was that [female] 's garden began .
over in the coppice the nightingale sang exultantly as if he knew of the wonder that his song had revealed to the lovers who listened to him with their lips together . she got out of bed again and dressed methodically , this time she was not going to put up with any condition that detracted from her dignity . so , having done her hair afresh and satisfied herself that all traces of her breakdown had disappeared . she set out with a high degree of confidence to gabrielle 's room . there was no light in it , but while she stood at the door she heard gabrielle softly singing to herself inside , singing !
only [female] returned the manager 's gaze . she was seated on the outer rim of the semi circle . and she stared frankly at mr. [male] , she had never seen anything like him before . and he fascinated her , this behaviour on her part singled her out from the throng . and mr. [male] concentrated his attention on her .
one might come to fruit in death , she had had enough , for where was life to be found ? no flowers grow upon busy machinery , there is no sky to a routine . there is no space to a rotary motion , and all life was a rotary motion . mechanised , cut off from reality , there was nothing to look for from life . it was the same in all countries and all peoples .
`` by the head of the prophet , a most wonderful blow ! '' said the soldan , critically and accurately examining the iron bar which had been cut asunder . and the blade of the sword was so well tempered as to exhibit not the least token of having suffered by the feat it had performed . he then took the king 's hand . and looking on the size and muscular strength which it exhibited .
she was silent for a time , with her nose on the pillow . and that brought her to : what 's the good of pretending ? i love him , she said aloud to the dim forms of her room . and repeated it , and went on to imagine herself doing acts of tragically dog like devotion to the biologist . who , for the purposes of the drama , remained entirely unconscious of and indifferent to her proceedings .
there was a terrible cowardice in this , olivia arundel shrank from marrying a man she did not love . prompted by no better desire than the mad wish to [female] herself away from her hated life . she wanted to fling the burden of responsibility in this matter away from her . let another decide , let another urge her to do this wrong ; and let the wrong be called a sacrifice . so for the first time she set to work deliberately to cheat her own conscience .
it was here , she said -- here , on this very balcony . that i first rebelled against you , and now you have brought me here that i should confess and submit on the same spot . i do confess , how am i to thank you for forgiving me ? on the following morning they went on to baden baden , and there they stopped for a couple of days . [female] had positively refused to stop a day at basle .
the moment had come for the [female] moreno to find out . to her surprise and cost , of what stuff this girl was made . this girl , who had for fourteen years lived by her side . docile , gentle , sunny , and uncomplaining in her loneliness . springing to her feet , and walking swiftly till she stood close face to face with the [female] .
[female] felt herself more deeply in love with him than ever when she read them . but her heart never gave the queer , quick , painful bound at sight of his letters which it had given one day when mrs. [female] sloane had handed her out an envelope addressed in [female] 's [female] , upright handwriting . [female] had hurried home to the east gable and opened it eagerly . to find a typewritten copy of some college society report -- only that and nothing more , [female] flung the harmless screed across her room and sat down to write an especially nice epistle to roy .
it seemed to her , later , in looking back upon all this , that for days afterwards not a word had been exchanged between them . the scene had been a strange one , but it had not permanently affected her feeling towards her father . for it was natural , after all , that he should occasionally make a scene of some kind . and he had let her alone for six months . the strangest part of it was that he had said he was not a good man .
but the asides of [female] were always loud enough to be heard by everybody . his murmurs were in the diapason of ordinary roaring . [male] heard him . and uttered an exclamation which made [male] start . the latter took [male] by the arm , and , after having asked [male] 's permission to say a word to his friend in private .
i have a beautiful play that i invented a long time ago when i first learned to read . i put myself to sleep every night by pretending i am the person in the book i am reading at the moment . at present i am [male] -- and such a sensible [male] ! i keep [male] amused all the time , and pet him and scold him and make him wrap up his throat when he has a cold . i have entirely cured him of being melancholy , the king and queen are both dead .
all this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling . and by that of an excellent fire , near which i sit in my cloak and bonnet . my muff and umbrella lie on the table . and i am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours exposure to the rawness of an october day .
on new year 's day a thaw set in . and during the night torrents of rain fell . in the morning , the morning of [male] 's departure for england . the river was streaked with fog and the rain drove hard against the windows of the breakfast room . [male] had finished his coffee and was pacing up and down , his wife sat at the table , watching him .
at one in the morning marguerite got into her carriage with her three friends . i took a cab and followed them . the carriage stopped at no , 9 , rue d'antin . marguerite got out and went in alone , it was no doubt a mere chance . but the chance filled me with delight .
the fifth day kent rose from his cot with hope still not quite dead in his heart . but that day passed and the sixth , and the missioner brought word that fingers was the old dirty fingers again . sitting from morning till night on his porch . on the seventh day came the final crash to kent 's hopes . [male] 's program had changed , he , kent .
because that to the left ran towards a suburb . that is to say , towards inhabited regions , and the right branch towards the open country . that is to say , towards deserted regions , however , they no longer walked very fast . [male] 's pace retarded [male] . he took her up and carried her again , [female] laid her head on the shoulder of the good man and said not a word .
as mr. [male] , by reason of his fatness and natural slowness . would perhaps be specially averse to walking about in the slush and mud , it might be that they would gain something . so after breakfast they started with umbrellas . [male] , [male] , mr. [male] the curate . mr. [male] the conservative attorney .
when sir [male] met her . he was the junior member of our embassy at naples . and she the distinguished leader of fashion in that city . we are not about to busy ourselves with the various narratives which professed to explain her influence at court . or the secret means to which she owed her ascendency over royal highnesses .
all her senses seemed to have become suddenly more acute , she was intensely alive to small details . then , abruptly , the whole world condensed itself into two eyes that were fastened upon hers . compelling eyes which she felt a panic desire to avoid . she turned her head away . and looked out into the restaurant , it seemed incredible that all these people .
finally , and before lanyard had finished dressing , the man from [organization] began placidly to snore . of course , he might well be bluffing ; for lanyard had taken pains to let roddy know that they were neighbours . by announcing his selection in loud tones close to the communicating door . but this was a question which the adventurer meant to have answered before he went out ... it was hard upon twelve o'clock when the mirror on the dressing table assured him that he was at length point device in the habit and apparel of a gentleman of elegant nocturnal leisure .
m. [female] , after the luxuries of such a repast . which he called an excess , felt the want of a siesta . [male] began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting . and in that same locality ; but the procurator would listen to nothing . he would be taken to his room , and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest .
`` let dead men go , mack , '' he cried . but even as he spoke lenoir , seeing his opportunity . sprang at him and with a backward kick caught macdonald fair in the face and lashed him hard against the wall . it was the terrible french `` lash '' and was one of lenoir 's special tricks . [male] hugh , stunned and dazed , leaned back against the wall , spreading out his hands weakly before his face .
but abruptly it stopped , as if on a signal , for an instant there was a silence of waiting and suspense . which roused interest and piqued curiosity , then there began a delicate symphony which could mean nothing but spring in a forest . and on that the curtain went up , the prophecy of the music was fulfilled . for the scene was a woodland in april . with young leaves a flicker and blossoms in birth .
his eye travelled over the length and breadth of that distant country . over the bay of rainbows , the sombre sea of crises . the ocean of storms , the lake of dreams . the vast walled plains , and the wondrous ring mountains . till he almost felt himself to be voyaging bodily through its wild scenes .
i found my own room delightful . [male] had unpacked and stored away my entire outfit of clothing . and had filled numerous shelves with the library i had brought along . everything was in order and place . from my shaving outfit in the drawer beside [location] .
he led [male] through the narrow stairway by which he had entered . which had been built between false walls , and we played ghost for one another . to show just how the tread of a human being around the chimney sounded , there was much to explain . and my grandfather 's contrition for having placed me in so hazardous a predicament was so sincere . and his wish to make amends so evident , that my heart warmed to him .
sonya read painstakingly in her high pitched voice . the count listened with closed eyes , heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages . [female] sat erect , gazing with a searching look now at her father and now at [female] . [female] felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round . the countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in the manifesto .
she paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment . then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man . and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak . lest she might wound marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement . not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils .
but day followed day , and no letter came from [male] . ten evenings running he smoked over the gate . leisurely , largely , almost languidly , hut always watching for the peak of the postman 's cap as it turned the corner by the court house . and following the toes of his foot as they stepped off the curb . to see if they pointed in his direction -- and then turning aside with a deep breath and a smothered moan that ended in a rattle of the throat and a pretence at spitting .
mr. [male] considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear . and here would be a ninth -- and emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for forty eight hours without falling in with a dinner party . the event was more favourable to mr. [male] than to emma , [male] came . but mr. [male] was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day . he might be able to join them in the evening .
when he had almost demolished the dish of shrimps he stopped . looked a little regretfully at the debris on his plate , then straightened himself in his chair . and began to take an interest in what was going on around him , he smiled benignly on his sisters . teased his daughter , and looked with shy curiosity at [male] . to whom he did not dare to address any remarks until nearly the end of lunch .
we learned how to bleed men to cure them of all ailments . all of the great modern inventions come from the home of the scholars . such as the newest one , which was found only a hundred years ago , of how to make candles from wax and string . also , how to make glass , which is put in our windows to protect [male] from the rain . to find these things , the scholars must study the earth and learn from the rivers .
after that last reply i waited a little , to reconsider what i had heard . if i unreservedly accepted the story so far , it was now plain that no approach . direct or indirect , to the secret had yet been revealed to me , and that the pursuit of my object had ended again in leaving me face to face with the most palpable and the most disheartening failure . but there was one point in the narrative which made me doubt the propriety of accepting it unreservedly . and which suggested the idea of something hidden below the surface .
the canon , the curate , and the barber told him he would act very wisely in doing as he said . and so , highly amused at [male] 's simplicities , they placed [male] in the cart as before . the procession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road . the goatherd took his leave of the party . the officers of the brotherhood declined to go any farther .
barth 's ax rang out again , the vibrations of each lusty blow could be felt distinctly along the solid ice wall . after a last downward step he would begin to notch his way up the other side . where the angle was much more favorable to rapid progress , spencer stole another glance over his shoulder . [male] had fully ten feet of the rearmost section of rope in hand . his head was thrown well back , standing with his face to the ice .
for several minutes after that last swift movement of jolly [male] 's . [male] lay where his master had left him . his eyes fairly popping from his head in his eagerness to see what was happening . he heard voices , and then the wild thrill of jolly [male] 's laughter . and restraining himself no longer he trotted cautiously to the open door of the cabin .
yes , i marvelled more since i knew more of the girl than mr. [male] . if only her true name ; and more of captain [male] . if only the fact that he was the son of a delicate erotic poet of a markedly refined and autocratic temperament . yes , i knew their joint stories which mr. [male] did not know . the chapter in it he was opening to me .
`` i used to have nice hair , '' she mourned . `` but these last few years i have let myself go , '' she made half hearted attempts to smooth the straggling tendrils on her temples . but presently laid down her brush and clicked her tongue against her teeth . `` i hope that man 's not worrying [female] , '' she said . there was no reassurance ready , so i went to the other side of the room to put her hat down on a chair .
her conjectures , however , were not intently carried on , and she was watching the light quite idly . when it gradually changed color , and at length shone blue as sapphire . thus it remained several minutes , and then it passed through violet to red . her curiosity was so widely awakened by the phenomenon that she sat up in bed . and stared steadily at the shine , an appearance of this sort .
just here was the wayside shop of a smith . and now arrived a landed proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back . deliverable here where her irons could be taken off , they were removed . then there was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to which should pay the blacksmith . the moment the girl was delivered from her irons .
the fine hostelry was closed to him ; he was seeking some very humble public house . some hovel , however lowly , just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets . a pine branch suspended from a cross beam of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight . he proceeded thither , it proved to be , in fact . a public house , the public house which is in the rue [male] chaffaut .
a few evenings after his dismissal from the church repairs . and before he had obtained any more work to do , he went to attend a meeting of the aforesaid committee . it was late when he arrived : all the others had come . and as he entered they looked dubiously at him . and hardly uttered a word of greeting , he guessed that something bearing on himself had been either discussed or mooted .
it would , perhaps , be difficult to decide , -- between lord [female] and miss [female] . which had been most wrong , or which had been nearest to the right , in the circumstances which had led to their separation . the old lord , wishing to induce his son to undertake work of some sort . and feeling that his own efforts in this direction were worse than useless . had closeted himself with his intended daughter in law .
the magic charm of the moon was breaking , had broken : a crash of cymbals and the studio was dark . then light began to glimmer once more , but it was the chill light of dawn . and growing from purple to blue , from blue to [female] day . it showed the marble statues fast locked in marble sleep again . on the platform stood the girl with uplifted arm .
together they entered the [male] , the road was well beaten and the horses were keen to go . so that before many minutes were over they were half through the [male] . [male] 's spirits rose and he began to take some interest in his companion 's observations upon the beauty of the lights and shadows falling across their path . `` look at that very dark shadow from the spruce there , [female] , '' she cried , pointing to a deep , [female] turn in the road .
[female] hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very low tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand . the man left the room , and returned almost immediately , accompanied by three others . the four men , four porters with broad shoulders . went and placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention . behind the table on which the man of the rue des billettes was leaning with his elbows .
what , in such case , would it behove him to do ? should he pack up his all , his lancet cases , pestle and mortar . and seek anew fresh ground in a new world . leaving behind a huge triumph to those learned enemies of his , fillgrave , century , and rerechild ? better that than remain at greshamsbury at the cost of his child 's heart and pride .
on the fine days at this time of the year . and earlier , certain ephemeral operations were apt to disturb , in their trifling way . the majestic calm of egdon heath , they were activities which . beside those of a town , a village , or even a farm . would have appeared as the ferment of stagnation merely , a creeping of the flesh of somnolence .
`` nay , '' interposed madame [male] villefort . on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression . `` nay , but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own . '' his life , madame , belongs not to him . it is mine , in return for my having myself saved him from death .
[male] 's convalescence progressed apace when once his course of action was decided upon . it had been a severe blow to [female] 's happiness that she was so soon to lose the little friend whom she had come to love . a blow that was not softened by [male] 's asking permission to accompany him . that her guardian was not sufficiently well to travel alone , however , made the woman 's request a perfectly natural one . and when at last [male] and his self appointed nurse , the farewells over .
the proceedings began on the first morning with the entrance of mr. [male] . the musical director , a brisk , busy little man with benevolent eyes behind big spectacles . who bustled over to the piano , sat down , and played a loud chord . designed to act as a sort of [male] blast . rallying the ladies of the ensemble from the corners where they sat in groups , chatting .
it would be useless to chronicle the events of the three years that followed . events and experiences by which the family grew from an abject condition of want to a state of comparative self reliance . based , of course , on the obvious prosperity of [female] and the generosity of her distant husband . [female] was seen now and then , a significant figure , visiting [male] . and sometimes coming out to the house where he occupied with [male] the two best rooms of the second floor .
porthos swallowed the second glass with the same [male] with which he had imbibed the first . took his beaver and followed [male] , as for [male] . he remained bewildered with what he had seen , having been forbidden by [male] to leave the room until the tumult was over . [male] had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him . and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he .
but at present one might fancy the house in the early stage of a chancery suit . and that the fruit from that grand double row of walnut trees on the right hand of the enclosure would fall and rot among the grass . if it were not that we heard the booming bark of dogs echoing from great buildings at the back . and now the half weaned calves that have been sheltering themselves in a gorse built hovel against the left hand wall come out and set up a silly answer to that terrible bark . doubtless supposing that it has reference to buckets of milk .
de winter , stupefied , looked on while the soldiers bound [male] . and could not tell what to think of such insensibility , one thing alone , however , threw a shade over the pallid brow of [male] . at every noise he heard , the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of [female] coming to throw herself into his arms . to accuse herself , and die with him , all at once he started . his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea .
after a curtsey to him she turned her attention to her skirts . wound them about her ankles . sat on the trunk , and dangled her shapely feet half an inch over the surface of the stream . then [male] had time to observe that the other end of the tree did not reach the opposite bank . but dipped short into the water , so he barricaded his end by sitting on it .
to have such knowledge forced on him , at his time of life . about [organization] 's mother i he picked the letter up from the carpet . tore it across , and then , when it hung together by just the fold at the back . stopped tearing , and reread it , he was taking at that moment one of the decisive resolutions of his life . he would not be forced into another scandal , no , however he decided to deal with this matter .
the other trembled , as if physically beaten upon by this appeal , but she gathered herself together rigidly . how can i answer you such a thing as that ? i must not listen to you . you must not ask me , she turned and left the girl standing still in her attitude of imploring . but in her own room , where she locked herself in . sobs mingled with the laughter which broke crazily from her lips as she removed this ribbon and that jewel .
when he was a boy of ten . on the eve of being sent to school at rennes . she had come on a visit to his godfather . who was her [female] , it happened that at the time he was taken by rabouillet to the manor of gavrillac . and there he had been presented to [female] , [female] plougastel .
notwithstanding his compact with mrs. [female] . old mr. [male] kept the paper so long . and was so chary of wasting his man 's time on a merely intellectual errand . that unless she sent for the journal it seldom reached her hands . [female] was always her messenger , the arrival of the soldiers led mrs. [female] to despatch her daughter for it the day after the party .
not that the captain -- [male] was careful to explain -- did not see things as a ship master should . the proof of it was that on that very occasion he desired him suddenly after a period of silent pacing . to have all the staysails sheets eased off , and he was going on with some other remarks on the subject of these staysails when mrs. [female] followed by her father emerged from the companion . she established herself in her chair to leeward of the skylight as usual . thereupon the captain cut short whatever he was going to say .
he did so -- but he did it without system . plan , foresight or judgment , and as he frittered away the sums that flowed in . he advertised for more -- and got it , during a period of general business prosperity he set up the orb bank and the sceptre trust . simply , it seems for advertising purposes . they were mere names , he was totally unable to organize anything .
most essentially is she the woman and home maker . she is a born cook , the steward and [female] prepare dishes extraordinary and [female] luxe for the cabin table . yet miss west is able at a moment 's notice to improve on these dishes . she never lets any of their dishes come on the table without first planning them or passing on them . she has quick judgment , an unerring taste .
4 , gets to college and has a problematical future , feels lost without his circle . and always says that school days were happiest , after all , goes back to school and makes speeches about whatregis 's boys are doing . at first amory noticed only the wealth of [male] creeping across the long . green swards , dancing on the leaded window panes , and swimming around the tops of spires and towers and battlemented walls . gradually he realized that he was really walking up university place .
in this manner mr. [male] 's party had been arranged . and to this party the grangers were bidden , even the serious sophia was going . indeed , it is to be observed that this young lady joined in all mundane gaieties . under protest as it were , mr. [male] did know a great many people . his abnormal wealth , and a certain amount of cleverness .
it was not the wine , but the woman . that was perplexing him , not often had the lure of gold failed so signally . and why was she so manifestly startled at the last moment ? had he gone too far ? was he mistaken in the assumption that millicent [male] had said little or nothing concerning him to her friend ? and this commission too , -- there were inexplicable features about it .
but even in that mild disagreement they had , as he said . come nearer than either liked to a quarrel -- and neither could quite forget it . both felt that the thin edge of what might have been a disrupting wedge had threatened their complete harmony . because he could mark the transition of this thing called conscience into an obsession . and because he , too , was worn in patience and stinging with resentment against the injustice of the father .
`` look you , my good father , '' said sir [male] , `` if you '' are for piety . i say no more ; ye begin late , that is all , but if you are in any sense bent upon wisdom , hear me . this lad beginneth to irk me like a wasp .
gareth answered them with laughter . swearing he had glamour enow in his own blood . his princedom , youth and hopes . to plunge old [male] in [location] ; so pushed them all unwilling toward the gate . and there was no gate like it under heaven .
the first sounds were those of a conflict between a bull and a wolf . i heard a great infuriated bellow go up from wolf larsen . and from leach a snarling that was desperate and blood curdling , [male] must have joined him immediately . so that his abject and grovelling conduct on deck for the past few days had been no more than planned deception . i was so terror stricken by this fight in the dark that i leaned against the ladder .
the next day they reached the place where [male] had laid the broom branches as marks to direct him to where he had left his master . and recognising it he told them that here was the entrance . and that they would do well to dress themselves , if that was required to deliver his master . for they had already told him that going in this guise and dressing in this way were of the highest importance in order to rescue his master from the pernicious life he had adopted . and they charged him strictly not to tell his master who they were .
christmas was come and gone , and no sign was made from [location] . so far , at least , as the little town was concerned , there came almost daily from the castle new tales of slights put upon the queen . and now and again of new favours granted to her , her chaplain , withdrawn for a while . had been admitted to her again a week before christmas ; a crowd had collected to see the popish priest ride in . and had remarked on his timorous air ; and about the same time a courier had been watched as he rode off to [location] .
by not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken , unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife . who was really extremely happy to see him , and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years . she had been almost fluttered for a few minutes , and still remained so sensibly animated as to put away her work . move pug from her side , and give all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband . she had no anxieties for anybody to cloud her pleasure .
effortless , dominating , the mighty threat of the storm . made articulate by the resistance of the elsinore . shouted in all the stays , bellowed in the shrouds , thrummed the taut ropes against the steel masts . and from the myriad tiny ropes far aloft evoked a devil 's chorus of shrill pipings and screechings . and yet , through this bedlam of noise , came captain [male] 's voice .
not that in appearance he seemed in the least gorilla like , what i am striving to express is this strength itself . more as a thing apart from his physical semblance , it was a strength we are wont to associate with things primitive . with wild animals , and the creatures we imagine our tree dwelling prototypes to have been—a strength savage . ferocious , alive in itself , the essence of life in that it is the potency of motion . the elemental stuff itself out of which the many forms of life have been moulded .
no need for her to strengthen the spell now , no waverers here . and thus it came true that gratitude was the sole motive for her display . she stood with eyes downcast and hands folded behind her . moonlit in the glow of lanterns . modest to the point of pathos , while the duke gracefully and simply introduced her to the multitude .
the last clause of this speech was meant to make [female] . but molly was in twenty minds as to whether she should accept the olive branch or not . her temper , however , was of that obtuse kind which is not easily ruffled . her mind , stagnant in itself . enjoyed excitement from without ; and her appetite was invariably good , so she stayed .
there was a bed in the room , and we were walking to and again . eager in the discourse ; at last he takes me by surprise in his arms . and threw me on the bed and himself with me . and holding me fast in his arms , but without the least offer of any indecency . courted me to consent with such repeated entreaties and arguments .
the [male] was so close now , that , when he lifted his hat . [male] could see a pair of gray eves rather near together . a delicate irregular nose with a little ripple in it . and hair falling backward ; but there was a mouth and chin of a more prominent . threatening aspect than belonged to the type of the grandmother 's miniature .
we all know the abominable adjuncts of a new building . the squalid half used heaps of bad mortar , the eradicated grass . the truculent mud , the scattered brickbats . the remnants of timber , the debris of the workmen 's dinners . the morsels of paper scattered through the dirt !
it was said that his being town agent to lord [male] tite [male] was referable . not to his having the least business capacity , but to his looking so supremely benignant that nobody could suppose the property screwed or jobbed under such a man . also , that for similar reasons he now got more money out of his own wretched lettings . unquestioned , than anybody with a less nobby and less shining crown could possibly have done . in a word , it was represented ( [male] called to mind .
these last words she had underscored at first , but the doing so had been the unconscious expression of her own affection . and had been done with no desire on her part to convey that expression to him . but on reading the words she discovered their latent meaning . and wrote it all again , therefore i know that it will be best that i should wish you good by . and i do so , thanking you again and again for your goodness to me .
so he entered , and anon there met with him two brethren . the one hight sir [male] . and the other hight sir [male] . and anon they met with sir [male] cote male taile . and first [male] cote male taile smote down [male] .
as the brothers paced the yard , [male] the bond looked about him to receive salutes . returned them by graciously lifting off his hat , and , with an engaging air . prevented [male] the free from running against the company , or being jostled against the wall . the collegians as a body were not easily impressible , but even they . according to their various ways of wondering , appeared to find in the two brothers a sight to wonder at .
he sensed rather than felt the swift movement of the canoe . there was no perceptible tremor to its progress , the current and a perfect craftsmanship with the paddles were carrying it along at six or seven miles an hour . he heard the rippling of water that at times was almost like the tinkling of tiny bells . and more and more bell like became that sound as he listened to it . it struck a certain note for him .
he almost failed to hear the last words , and he made no effort to reply . he kept his canoe nearer to jean 's . so that frequently they were running side by side . in the quick fall of the early northern night the sun was becoming more and more of a red haze in the sky as it sank farther toward the western forests . [female] had changed her position , so that she now sat facing the bow of the canoe .
my landlady was very courteous , took my money for my reckoning . but was called away , all the house being in a hurry , so i left her . took the fellow up to my chamber , gave him the trunk . or portmanteau , for it was like a trunk . and wrapped it about with an old apron , and he went directly to his boat with it .
it was no more the withered limb of eld than my own . it was a rounded supple member . with smooth fingers , symmetrically turned ; a broad ring flashed on the little finger . and stooping forward , i looked at it , and saw a gem i had seen a hundred times before . again i looked at the face ; which was no longer turned from me -- on the contrary .
turnbull hurried to meet them , bowing profoundly , and looking very much like issachar between the chairs he carried . but they turned aside to where [male] stood , and in a few minutes the counter was covered with various stuffs for some of the smaller articles of ladies ', attire . large , and grandly made , hesper stood `` straight , and steady , and tall , '' dusky fair , and colorless , with the carriage of a young matron . her brown hair seemed ever scathed and crinkled afresh by the ethereal flame that here and there peeped from amid the unwilling volute rolled back from her creamy forehead in a rebellious coronet .
not , again , that any one of these novels will deliberately attempt to prove anything . i have been amused at the allegations brought by certain critics against the woman who did that it `` failed to prove '' the practicability of unions such as herminia 's and [female] 's . the famous scotsman , in the same spirit , objected to paradise lost that it `` proved naething '' : but his criticism has not been generally endorsed as valid , to say the truth .
to great powers of reasoning and a very strong judgment he united a most acute knowledge of men . not exactly of mankind in the mass , but of that especial order with whom he had habitually to deal . stolid , commonplace stupidity might puzzle or embarrass him . while for any amount of craft , for any degree of subtlety . he was an over match , the plain matter of fact intelligence occasionally gained a slight advantage over him at first .
the very young man , shouting again to aura to run , stood awestruck , watching the titanic struggle that was raging below him . the great lizard rose high on its forelegs to meet this enemy . its tremendous jaws opened -- and snapped closed ; but the bird avoided them . its huge claws gripped the reptile 's back ; its flapping wings spread the sixty foot width of the gully as it strove to raise its prey into the air . the roaring of these enormous wings was deafening ; the wind from them as they came up tore past the very young man in violent gusts .
the clamour died again at the same instant ... for a moment his eyes wandered over the heads and up to the sky . to see if some vision ... then he looked down ... against the ladder on which he stood . a man 's figure was writhing and embracing the rungs kneeling on the ground . he was strangely dressed , in some sort of a loose gown . in a tight silk night cap , and his feet were bare .
[male] took the distribution of the whisky off my hands . and the bottles began to make their appearance while i worked over the fresh batch of wounded men in the forecastle . i had seen whisky drunk , such as whisky and soda by the men of the clubs . but never as these men drank it , from pannikins and mugs . and from the bottles—great brimming drinks , each one of which was in itself a debauch .
[female] 's heart sank lower than she had known it could go . and she grew white to the lips , the observant grandmother decided that she had done well to be so prompt . the man from [location] was by no means to be admitted . she gave orders to that effect . unknown to [female] , the girl went slowly to her room , all at once it had dawned upon her that she had not given her address to the man the night before .
gerald looked round and saw the girl standing by the water 's edge . looking at him , he pulled the boat towards her . magnetically , without thinking of her , in his world , his conscious world . she was still nobody , he knew that [female] had a curious pleasure in treading down all the social differences . at least apparently , and he left it to her , `` how do you do , [female] ? ''
she walked bravely , but aimlessly , that was plain to be seen , it was evident that she was and was not looking for someone . baldos observed with a thrill of delight that a certain red feather stood up defiantly from the band of her sailor hat . he liked the way her dark blue walking skirt swished in harmony with her lithe , firm strides . she was quite near before he advanced from his place among the trees . he did not expect her to exhibit surprise or confusion and he was not disappointed .
`` well , all i can make out is that everything is abominable , abominable , quite abominable ! '' said prince [male] , and he went off to the house where the commander in chief was . passing by kutuzov 's carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite . with their cossacks who were talking loudly together , prince [male] entered the passage . kutuzov himself , he was told , was in the house with prince bagration and weyrother .
he had intended , in the character of a tormentor . not only to pursue and hover around her himself , but he had also hoped . in the same character , to have kept at a distance all other admirers . but the violence with which he had over acted his part . by raising her disgust and the indignation of the company .
a horrid apprehension possessed her , it had been easy for swithin to give up what he had never known the advantages of keeping . but having once begun to enjoy his possession would he give it up now ? could he be depended on for such self sacrifice ? before leaving , he would have done anything at her request . but the mollia [male] fandi had now passed , suppose there arrived no reply from him for the next three months . and that when his answer came he were to inform her that , having now fully acquiesced in her original decision .
now i only set down that to show how perverse those foreign people are , they will drink their wretched heartless stuff . such as they call claret , or wine of medoc . or bordeaux , or what not , with no more meaning than sour rennet . stirred with the pulp from the cider press . and strained through the cap of our [male] , this is very well for them .
trail , trail , went her long dress over the sopping grass . and she came back with her hands full of the hay that was cut yesterday . i suppose for rabbits or something , as she kept on smelling it . the air here is delicious , later on i heard the noise of croquet balls . and looked out again , and it was [male] practising .
[male] left the saloon in silence . it was worse than useless talking to this man , who presumed upon his helpless state . and openly defied him , his next effort must be to see [male] . this he found impossible , for the time being at any rate . the state room number seven was an apartment a little bigger than a rabbit hutch .
but molly stood against the new gown for herself , and urged that if cynthia and walter were to come to visit them often . they had better see them as they really were . in dress , habits , and appointments . when mr. [male] had left the room . mrs. [female] softly reproached molly for her obstinacy .
he shook off the mood , angry with himself for entertaining it . it was maudlin , after all chabrillane and [male] were quite exceptional swordsmen . but neither of them really approached his own formidable calibre , reaction began to flow . as he drove out through country lanes flooded with [male] september [male] . his spirits rose , a premonition of victory stirred within him .
the visit had been made almost at the instigation of the editor himself . the paper from beginning to end was full of falsehood and malice . and had been written with the express intention of creating prejudice against the man who had offended the writer . but mr. [male] did not know that he was lying , and did not know that he was malicious . the weapon which he used was one to which his hand was accustomed .
but millicent could not know that , losing all command of herself . she shrieked in terror , and ran wildly among the trees . she stumbled and fell before she had gone five yards over the rough ground . quite in a panic , confused and blinded with snow , she rose and ran again . only to find herself speeding back to the burial ground , then , in a very agony of distress .
phillotson 's suit was not exactly prospering , evidently ; and jude felt unreasonably glad . he packed up his things and went to melchester with a lighter heart than he had known for months . this being the turning over a new leaf he duly looked about for a temperance hotel . and found a little establishment of that description in the street leading from the station . when he had had something to eat he walked out into the dull winter light over the town bridge .
as she turned over the socks in the basket . she glanced up now and then at pamela 's face . which was bent over her work , it had been a pretty face . but now there were faint lines upon it here and there . the features once delicate were sharpened , the blue eyes were faded , and the blonde hair faded also .
while he was still thinking thus , standing at his window and gazing out on to the market place of the quiet little town . he suddenly saw [female] herself driving in her pony carriage . it was a wet and windy day . the rain was on her cheek . and the wind tossed a little lock of her brown hair .
it was the only thing that vavasor could do . and he did walk himself off , he walked himself off . and went home to his own lodgings in [male] street . that he might smooth his feathers after the late encounter before he went down to westminster to take his seat in [organization] . i do not think that he was comfortable when he got there , or that he felt himself very well able to fight another battle that night on behalf of the river bank .
it was a narrow , dark street , very quiet , having about it a certain air of poor respectability . an obscure , noiseless street , without even a sign of life . some unfortunate one had endeavoured here to keep an hotel ; -- but there was no hotel kept there now . there had been much craft in selecting the place in which the child had been taken from them . as they looked around them , perceiving the terrible misfortune which had befallen them .
emma had no longer an alarm for [male] . his interest was yet safe ; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment . not more than five couple could be mustered ; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful . and she found herself well matched in a partner . they were a couple worth looking at , two dances .
my mind soon grew calm ; and i began the duties of my new position . somewhat instructed , i hoped , by the adventures that had befallen me in fairy land . could i translate the experience of my travels there , into common life ? this was the question , or must i live it all over again , and learn it all over again . in the other forms that belong to the world of men .
i crossed the road , and looked at the bill in my turn . the performance announced was lucrezia borgia , and it was to take place that evening . the opera glass in the count 's hand . his careful reading of the bill , and his direction to the cabman . all suggested that he proposed making one of the audience , i had the means of getting an admission for myself and a friend to the pit by applying to one of the scene painters attached to the theatre .
but i have let this moment slip by . i did not , with uncompromising strength , press the almost certain into the absolutely assured . i now see clearly that some hidden elements in my nature have openly ranged themselves as obstacles in my path . that is exactly how ravana , whom i look upon as the real hero of the ramayana . met with his doom , he kept sita in his asoka garden .
the old gentleman continued welcoming the new arrivals , chatting heartily , with a joke for this one and a kind inquiry for the other . but wretched geoffrey , so the dragon was to be seen in a few minutes ! and where were the monks of oyster le main ? still , a bold face must be kept . he was thankful that [male] , after the custom of brides , was invisible . the youth 's left hand rested upon the hilt of his sword .
her brother was not handsome : no , when they first saw him he was absolutely plain . [male] and plain ; but still he was the gentleman . with a pleasing address , the second meeting proved him not so very plain . he was plain , to be sure , but then he had so much countenance . and his teeth were so good , and he was so well made , that one soon forgot he was plain .
besides these bands , a less orderly and a worse armed force , consisting of the saxon inhabitants of the neighbouring township . as well as many bondsmen and servants from cedric 's extensive estate . had already arrived , for the purpose of assisting in his rescue , few of these were armed otherwise than with such rustic weapons as necessity sometimes converts to military purposes . boar spears , scythes , flails , and the like . were their chief arms ; for the normans , with the usual policy of conquerors .
things were gradually nearing a state where a general upheaval would have taken place had not life stepped in with one of its fortuitous solutions . mrs. [female] 's health failed . although stout and formerly of a fairly active disposition , she had of late years become decidedly sedentary in her habits and grown weak . which , coupled with a mind naturally given to worry , and weighed upon as it had been by a number of serious and disturbing ills . seemed now to culminate in a slow but very certain case of systemic poisoning , she became decidedly sluggish in her motions .
to account for his abrupt departure from lynbrook he had left word that he was called to town on business . but , since he did not mean to return , some farther explanation was now necessary . and he was paralyzed by the difficulty of writing , he had already telegraphed to his friend that he would be at the mills the next day . but the southern express did not leave till the afternoon , and he still had several hours in which to consider what he should say to his wife . to postpone the dreaded task , he invented the pretext of some business to be despatched .
he did not meddle with [male] 's cook fire . but he built a second fire where the cheer of it would light up [male] 's tent . and piled dry logs on it until the flame of it lighted up the gloom about them for a hundred feet . and then , with a pan in one hand and a stick in the other . he came close and beat a din that could have been heard a quarter of a mile away .
there was nothing else the matter , and our ribs were sound . [female] remained until everything possible to be done had been skilfully and promptly done -- the poor belated wanderer in a strange land movingly besought that favour of him . and lingered by the bed to which he was in due time removed . until he had fallen into a doze , even then he wrote a few words for him on his card . with a promise to return tomorrow , and left it to be given to him when he should awake .
well , but how delightful , and how very new , now she would really be able to think , uninterruptedly . delicious to be forgotten , still , she was hungry ; and mrs. wilkins . after that excessive friendliness the night before , might at least have told her lunch was ready . and she had really been excessively friendly -- so nice about mellersh 's sleeping arrangements . wanting him to have the spare room and all , she was not usually interested in arrangements .
provided , further , that in the event of the marriage of said [female] to the said [female] . or in the event of any promise or contract of marriage between said persons within five years from the date of said [male] 's acceptance of the provisions of this will . the whole estate shall become the property absolutely ofagatha 's school at [location] . [location] , [location] , a corporation under the laws of said state . `` bully for the old boy , '' i muttered finally , folding the copy with something akin to reverence for my grandfather 's shrewdness in closing so many doors upon his heirs .
she took her youngest sister to live with her . she had her garden and hens and a cow . the farm brought her enough to live on , and she was always busy , when fifteen years had gone by there were naturally some changes in [male] , sleepy and . unprogressive as it was , most of the old people were in the little hillside burying ground that fronted the sunrise . old [male] was there with his recollections of four generations .
leah brought it ; she entered , followed by mrs. [female] . who repeated the news ; adding that mr. [male] the surgeon was come . and was now with mr. [female] : then she hurried out to give orders about tea . and i went upstairs to take off my things , mr. [male] . it seems , by the surgeon 's orders .
and as for the judge and [male] , i was glad they were sitting beside each other . for i could avoid that side of the table with my eyes until i had steadied myself a few seconds at least . the surprise made the others i had been dining seem statues from the stone age . and only mr. [male] fork failed to hang fire . his appetite is as strong as his nerves , and [location] hawes looked at his composure with the relief plain in her eyes .
but the light of that day 's discovery . shining on these considerations , roused him to take a more decided course of action . confident in the rectitude of his purpose . and impelled by a sense of overhanging danger closing in around . he resolved , if his mother would still admit of no approach .
they crowded in by dozens , staring about in blank wonder . gaping curiosity , ill disguised alarm , [female] took pains to explain the machinery . stage by stage , till some of the more intelligent caught up the principle . and made [male] at the notion of `` devils . '' but they all looked with great awe at the master .
silent herself , patricia watched with interest the ferment around her . with the exception of mrs. [organization] . all seemed to desire most of all to emphasize their own attitude of splendid intellectual calm during the raid . they spoke scornfully of acquaintances who had flown from [location] because of the danger from bomb dropping gothas . they derided the thames valley aliens .
the doctor contrived to escape without giving a definite answer to this question . and then , having paid his compliments to lady scatcherd , remounted his cob and rode back to greshamsbury . dr thorne did not at once go home to his own house . when he reached the greshamsbury gates . he sent his horse to its own stable by one of the people at the lodge .
`` for working for mrs. redmain with your hands , '' she said , and , breaking into a little laugh , caught his cheeks between those same hands . and reaching up gave him a kiss that made him ashamed of himself . a little , that is , and for the moment , that is : [male] was used to being this or that a little for the moment . for this same dress , which [male] had thus glorified in song .
and then had come lord lansdowne , who , in crossing the lawn to shake hands with his host . had been observed to keep his eye fixed upon one particular point , `` burmistone , '' he said , after having spoken his first words , `` who is that tall girl in white ? '' and in ten minutes lady [female] , mrs. [female] . mr. [male] , and divers others too numerous to mention .
but this [female] did not hear , having already left town for a few days at camylott . where my lord [male] accompanied him . and at the week 's end they went together to warwickshire . and as on the occasion of [male] 's other visit . the first evening they were at the wolde came my lord [male] .
it is now something over twelve months since she died at [location] in her mother 's house . i never saw her since the day we first parted . i have not a word to say against her . the fault was mine in marrying a woman whom i did not love and had never loved . when i married lady alexandrina i loved .
the phonograph screeches its reply to le violon . and [male] and [male] and [male] no longer find themselves the kings of the earth when they come in from far countries with their precious cargoes of furs . and they no longer swagger and tell loud voiced adventure . or sing their wild river songs in the same old abandon . for there are streets at athabasca landing now , and hotels .
marius had left [female] gillenormand in despair . he had entered the house with very little hope . and quitted it with immense despair , however , and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will understand this . the officer , the lancer , the ninny . [male] theodule , had left no trace in his mind .
and the flowers give out to the dewy night . changed into perfume , the gathered light ; and the darkness sinks upon all their host . till the sun sail up on [location] -- she will wake and see the branches bare . weaving a net in the frozen air , the story goes on to tell how . at last , weary with wintriness , she travelled towards the southern regions of her globe .
[female] perceived that he was wearied , sleep swoops down upon the exhausted frame like a bird upon its prey . he drooped and sank upon the deck of the bark without choosing his position . and there slept , stretched at length and inert , he remained thus for some hours . scarcely distinguishable from the beams and joists among which he lay . the sea was growing calmer , but there was still a heavy swell .
the first thing annie had done was this : she made herself look ugly . this was not an easy thing ; but she had learned a great deal from her husband . upon the subject of disguises , it hurt her feelings not a little to make so sad a fright of herself . but what could it matter ? -- if she lost [female] . she must be a far greater fright in earnest .
[male] 's preserver , as [male] . with more elegance than precision , styled willoughby . called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries . he was received by mrs. [female] with more than politeness . with a kindness which sir [male] 's account of him and her own gratitude prompted .
phineas , as he journeyed down to saulsby , knew that he had in truth made up his mind . he was going thither nominally that he might listen to the advice of almost his oldest political friend before he resolved on a matter of vital importance to himself . but in truth he was making the visit because he felt that he could not excuse himself from it without unkindness and ingratitude . she had implored him to come , and he was bound to go . and there were tidings to be told which he must tell , it was not only that he might give her his reasons for not becoming an under secretary of state that he went to saulsby .
right so the maid made herself ready , and sir gawaine rode on to [location] . where he openly disclosed to all the court that it was sir [male] that bore the red sleeve . and that jousted best , and when sir [male] heard that , wit ye well he was a heavy man . and so were all his kinsmen , for it was he who had given sir [male] . that was his own [female] , the grievous wound in the tournament .
at last the [male] sluggish river and the old boat house came in sight . between a long vista of ugly distorted trunks and gnarled branches of pollard oak and willow . the building was dreary and dilapidated looking , for the improvements commenced by [male] arundel five years ago had never been fully carried out . but it was sufficiently substantial , and bore no traces of positive decay . down by the water 's edge there was a great cavernous recess for the shelter of the boats .
he sat down and wrote a long phrase , she understood it all . and without asking him , `` is it this ? '' took the chalk and at once answered . for a long while he could not understand what she had written , and often looked into her eyes . he was stupefied with happiness , he could not supply the word she had meant . but in her charming eyes , beaming with happiness , he saw all he needed to know .
the smallest boy i ever conversed with , carrying the largest baby i ever saw . offered a supernaturally intelligent explanation of the locality in its old uses . and was very nearly correct , how this young newton ( for such i judge him to be ) . came by his information , i do not know ; he was a quarter of a century too young to know anything about it of himself . i pointed to the window of the room where little [female] was born .
not to be beaten , however , we secured reinforcements and more ammunition . in the shape of old rags , brooms and so forth . and returned to the charge , and although we were driven back several times we stayed until we won out . and the last insect lay a quivering mass on the ground , there was not one among us . not wounded in some manner , as for myself i had enough of it .
knowing also as to beer and gin and tobacco . acquainted with every man and woman in the parish . thinking her husband to be quite as good as the squire in regard to position . and to be infinitely superior to the squire , or any other man in the world . in regard to his personal self ; -- a handsome .
so was the grande salle , with its huge solemn globe hanging in the midst . its pair of many branched chandeliers , and its horizontal grand piano closed . silent , enjoying its mid week sabbath , i rather wondered to find the first classe door ajar . this room being usually locked when empty , and being then inaccessible to any save madame [male] and myself . who possessed a duplicate key , i wondered still more .
to mr. [male] the surprise was not great ; like the lady in the story he had been played that trick too many times to be unprepared . but sue 's class was at the further end of the room . and her back was towards the entrance ; the inspector therefore came and stood behind her and watched her teaching some half minute before she became aware of his presence . she turned , and realized that an oft dreaded moment had come , the effect upon her timidity was such that she uttered a cry of fright . [male] , with a strange instinct of solicitude quite beyond his control .
the trees put on their green robes , changed them for russet and dropped them again . the dogs and the horses grew a little older , a beast died now and again . and others were born , the faces that she knew , servants and farmers , aged imperceptibly . here and there a family moved away , and another into its place ; an old man died and his son succeeded him . but the mother and sisters lived on in the house in patriarchal fashion .
after that he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him and either sat alone or came timidly to princess [female] . or to [male] of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt . and clung to them quietly and shyly , when princess [male] had left prince [male] she fully understood what [female] 's face had told her . she did not speak any more to [male] of hopes of saving his life . she took turns with her beside his sofa .
but a man who can own that he has done amiss without a pang . who can so own it to another man , or even to a woman . is usually but a poor creature , [male] must now make such confession . and therefore he became uneasy , and then , for him , there was another task behind the one which he would be called upon to perform this evening . a task which would have nothing of pleasantness in it to redeem its pain .
i led my young lady out : she was too glad of her escape to resist . the other followed , and mr. [male] had the room to himself till dinner . i had counselled [male] to dine up stairs ; but , as soon as he perceived her vacant seat . he sent me to call her , he spoke to none of us . ate very little , and went out directly afterwards , intimating that he should not return before evening .
i stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze . then i looked round ; there was no candle . but the uncertain light from the hearth showed , by intervals . papered walls , carpet , curtains , shining mahogany furniture . it was a parlour , not so spacious or splendid as the drawing room at gateshead .
these equipages adorned the yard of the hotel at martigny . on the return of the family from their mountain excursion . other vehicles were there , much company being on the road . from the patched italian vettura -- like the body of a swing from an english fair put upon a wooden tray on wheels . and having another wooden tray without wheels put atop of it .
with the net in one hand and the bucket in the other . he turned back up the creek and passed so close to where she had slipped aside into the bushes that she came near shrieking . but his eyes were fixed on a pool of the creek above and . to her wonder , he strolled straight into the water . with his boots on , pushing the net in front of him .
but as he gazed on the face and form . which now possessed his whole soul , to the exclusion of all other joys and griefs . the longing to speak to her , to know that she heard him . to hear from her one word in return , became so unendurable , that he suddenly and hastily resumed his preparations . stepping carefully from the circle , he put a small brazier into its centre .
his expression was so severe , so serene , so immobile , that it seemed obvious that for him at least there was a grandeur in the departing hour which no petty irritation on his part was to mar . although the wasting time wasted also high private hopes of his own , here she comes . like a ship in full sail , he said to himself . half remembering some line from a play or poem where the heroine bore down thus with feathers flying and airs saluting her . the greenery and the high presences of the trees surrounded her as if they stood forth at her coming .
her gouty uncle received very little company , and mrs. [female] . not having cultivated relations with her husband 's neighbours . was not warranted in expecting visits from them , she had . however , a peculiar taste ; she liked to receive cards . for what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish ; but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard .
how sweet it is to let oneself be persuaded by the voice that one loves ! marguerite and i spent the whole day in talking over our projects for the future . as if we felt the need of realizing them as quickly as possible . at every moment we awaited some event . but the day passed without bringing [male] any new tidings .
the income grudgingly left to his wife by [male] has enabled mr. [male] to begin business as a solicitor upon his own account . in a small town near [location] , with every apparent prospect of success . [male] 's home is within easy reach of the river side villa occupied by mr. and mrs. [female] . so she is able to see her dear [female] as often as she likes . nor is there any guest at the villa more welcome than this faithful friend .
now i wept : [female] burns was not here . nothing sustained me ; left to myself i abandoned myself . and my tears watered the boards , i had meant to be so good . and to do so much at lowood : to make so many friends , to earn respect and win affection . already i had made visible progress : that very morning i had reached the head of my class .
it was a weary long way tojames 's park on foot . and the young mother had a horror of omnibuses . in which she supposed smallpox and fever to be continually raging . sometimes they had a cab , and took the boy down to feed the ducks and stare at the soldiers . but in the park clarissa had an ever present terror of being seen by some one she knew .
mr [male] was well to do , and stood very high in mr [male] 's opinion . beginning with a good inheritance , he had married a good inheritance . and had thriven exceedingly in the marine insurance way . and was quite satisfied , he never could make out why everybody was not quite satisfied . and he felt conscious that he set a brilliant social example in being particularly well satisfied with most things .
she found her only safety in a chill haughtiness which made mr. [male] that mrs. [female] was becoming a perfect match for her husband . when at last the chances of the evening brought [female] near her . sir [male] and mrs. [male] were close by and could hear every word she said . no matter : her husband was not near , and her irritation passed without check into a fit of daring which restored the security of her self possession . [female] was there at last , and she would compel him to do what she pleased .
one thing is certain in our northern land -- allow that birth or valour . wealth or wit , give each precedence to their possessor . envy , that follows on such eminence , as comes the lyme hound on the roebuck 's trace . shall pull them down each one , sir [male] . not only were these deficiencies visible to others , but the archduke himself could not but sometimes entertain a painful consciousness that he was not altogether fit to maintain and assert the high rank which he had acquired .
he retreated , leaving marius alone in the cemetery . and there was discipline in this retreat , death appeared to him with large epaulets . and he almost made the military salute to him . not knowing what to write to his aunt , he decided not to write at all . and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by theodule as to the love affairs of marius .
it required quite a strategical combination to transport me from the town of vilagós to where the world is boarded up . this place was selected for me by my wife while she was already in pest . whence on the approach of the catastrophe she set out from home on a peasant 's car to seek me up and down the kingdom . for a time she travelled with the wife of [female] . who set her on my track , at the storming of szegedin we were all within an ace of being blown into the air by the explosion of a powder magazine .
but when he returned home he was as far as ever from any resolve to tell her how he was situated . i may say that his walk had done him no good . and that he had not made up his mind to anything . he had been building those pernicious castles in the air during more than half the time . not castles in the building of which he could make himself happy .
the next morning i sent my testimonials to the professor 's employer in portland place . three days passed , and i concluded , with secret satisfaction . that my papers had not been found sufficiently explicit , on the fourth day , however , an answer came . it announced that mr. [male] accepted my services . and requested me to start for cumberland immediately , all the necessary instructions for my journey were carefully and clearly added in a postscript .
cummins had partly closed the door after him . but watchers had seen the opening of it . a door opened here , and another there , and paths of yellow light flashed over the hard trodden snow as shadowy life came forth to greet what message he brought from the little cabin . beyond those flashes of light there was no other movement . and no sound , dark figures stood motionless .
that flitting had been a very dismal affair , an old man out of [male] had come for mrs. [female] 's things with a donkey cart . and the old man , assisted by the girl , had carried them out together . [female] had remained secluded in her mother 's room . the two sisters had met at the same table at breakfast . but had not spoken over their tea and bread and butter .
and he hurriedly took leave of [male] . valerius , who asked herself if the young nobleman was not a little off his head . [male] dressed in frantic haste , prepared to forget his distress by flinging himself . as people say , into `` the vortex of pleasure . '' alas , he was a very sorry guest and .
i showed this strange epistle to my mother . and consulted her on what i ought to do , she advised me to go . and i went—willing enough to see lady ashby , and her baby , too , and to do anything i could to benefit her . by consolation or advice ; for i imagined she must be unhappy . or she would not have applied to me thus—but feeling , as may readily be conceived .
just as he came in sight of the great chott between biskra and touggourt . [male] heard a sound which struck him strangely in the silence of the desert . it was the distant teuf teuf of a powerful motor car . labouring heavily through deep sand , [male] was travelling in a carriage . which he had hired in biskra , and was keeping as close as he dared to the vehicle in front .
he paused in his restless shuffle and again . seizing his cap with both hands , dragged it furiously right down on his ears . [male] had lost himself in listening to these broken ravings . in looking at that old feverish face when , suddenly , quick as lightning , mr. [male] spun round . snatched up the captain 's glass and with a stifled , hurried exclamation .
grace 's throat emitted a gasp of relief at finding the result so nearly as she had hoped . she went to the door and tapped lightly , he seemed to be accustomed to the noises of woodpeckers . squirrels , and such small creatures , for he took no notice of her tiny signal . and she knocked again , this time he came and opened the door . when the light of the room fell upon her face he started .
when he said `` miss [female] , '' she started and fell back from him . with an expression in her face of fright and something like dislike that caused him unutterable dismay . she had often avoided him before -- always , indeed , for a long , long while . she had turned away and glided off so often when she had seen him coming toward her . that the unfortunate young [male] could not think it accidental , but he had hoped that it might be shyness .
those who had occasion to pass the house frequently after dark perceived that the smoke from this chimney was different from the common smoke of common chimneys . sometimes vivid sparks glittered and flashed upon the darkness , at other times a semi luminous . green vapour was seen to issue from the mouth of the chimney . these facts were spoken about by the neighbours ; and by and by people discovered that the smoke issued from the chimney of [male] 's laboratory . where the surgeon was frequently employed , long after midnight , making experiments in the science of chemistry .
he was a very diminutive boy with a round head covered with coppery curls . a boy who stared at [male] out of a pair of very round . blue eyes , while he tenderly cherished a knee . and an elbow , he had been on the brink of tears for a moment . but meeting [male] 's quizzical gaze , he manfully repressed the weakness .
for days nothing was talked of but the ball . how this man had danced , the bad taste of this woman 's dress . and the possibility of a marriage , the ball had brought amusement to all . to esther it had brought happiness , her happiness was now visible in her face and audible in her voice . and [female] 's ironical allusions to her inability to learn to read no longer annoyed her .
it was , as mrs. [female] smilingly said to mrs. welland . a great event for a young couple to give their first big dinner . the newland archers , since they had set up their household . had received a good deal of company in an informal way . [female] was fond of having three or four friends to dine .
the returned traveller entered the house , where he found awaiting him poor old mrs. [female] . to whose earthly course death stood rather as the asymptote than as the end . she was perceptibly smaller in form than when he had left her . and she could see less distinctly , the form of [female] had disappeared from the kitchen . that ancient servant having been gathered to her fathers about six months before , her place being filled by a young girl who knew not [female] .
it had been settled between [male] that we should expect him soon after noon on the last day of december . for the doones being lazy and fond of bed . as the manner is of dishonest folk , the surest way to escape them was to travel before they were up and about . to wit , in the forenoon of the day . but herein we reckoned without our host : for being in high festivity .
the news aroused all [location] 's martial spirit . now at last the mystery surrounding morrison and [male] 's unnatural complaisance was riven . it had come to grapples again , he was glad of it . meet those notes ? well i guess so , he would show them what sort of a proposition they had tackled . sneaking , underhanded scoundrels , taking advantage of a mere boy .
and this was the way how , towards seven o'clock in the evening . without announcing his arrival by the din of trumpets . and without even his advanced guard , without out riders or musketeers . the king presented himself before the gate of [male] . where [male] , who had been informed of his royal guest 's approach .
the original assailants ; seeing themselves outnumbered and surrounded , threw down their arms without a word . `` seize me these fellows , '' said the hero of the trumpet . and when his order had been obeyed , he drew near to [male] and looked him in the face . [male] , returning this scrutiny , was surprised to find in one who had displayed such strength . skill and energy , a lad no older than himself .
baisemeaux ran to his iron chest and took it out . [male] seized hold of it . coolly tore it in four pieces , held them to the lamp . and burnt them , `` good heavens , what are you doing ? '' exclaimed [male] , in an extremity of terror .
`` he 's alive then , '' exclaimed [male] , pale in the sickly light . `` is that you , [male] ? '' he called . the only answer was another groan , together we forced the flat end of the crowbar into the crevice . pressed a piece of rock under it . and exerted all our strength , the slab moved upward an inch or two .
she was unusually helpful at breakfast , and unselfish about the eggs . and then she went off to catch the train before her father 's . she did this to please him , he hated travelling second class with her . indeed , he never did -- but he also disliked travelling in the same train when his daughter was in an inferior class . because of the look of the thing , so he liked to go by a different train .
it was a long and weary way , it reached over mountains and through valleys . across winding , turbulent streams and broad rivers that had few bridges . the rivers twice led her further south than she meant to go . in her ignorance , she had always felt that [location] was straight ahead east . as straight as one could go to the heart of the sun .
the relation of this last incident reminds me of one of his most curious peculiarities . which i have not yet mentioned -- his extraordinary fondness for pet animals , some of these he has left on the continent . but he has brought with him to this house a cockatoo . two canary birds , and a whole family of white mice . he attends to all the necessities of these strange favourites himself .
we sat together on the little bench , and for the first time in our acquaintance she appeared embarrassed . as if she knew what was passing in my mind , i have always believed that women . in addition to their acknowledged intuition , have a special sense that enables them to anticipate a declaration of passion . and i had no doubt that [female] was fully prepared for my confession in spite of her embarrassment . this induced me to proceed to the point without unnecessary preliminaries .
this speech frightened the housemaid , and she went straight to the widow 's room . mrs. [female] , always an early riser . had been up and dressed for some time , and went at once to look at her stepdaughter . she found [female] very calm and reasonable , there was no trace of bewilderment or delirium now in her manner . and when the principal doctor of [organization] came a couple of hours afterwards to look at the young heiress .
the shadows of leaves fall upon their arms . as they spread the branches apart , but their shoulders are in the sun . the skin of their arms is like a blue mist . but their shoulders are white and glowing , as if the light fell not from above . but rose from under their skin , we watch the leaf which has fallen upon their shoulder .
the bridge seemed longer than it had ever seemed before , and he was glad when he felt the beat of the wheels on the solid roadbed again . he did not like coming and going across that bridge , or remembering the man who built it . and was he , indeed , the same man who used to walk that bridge at night . promising such things to himself and to the stars ? and yet , he could remember it all so well : the quiet hills sleeping in the moonlight .
he had not known it would be like this ... he understood now that . at the moment of selling the letters , he had viewed the transaction solely as it affected himself . as an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise presentable record , he had scarcely considered the act in relation to [male] . for death , if it hallows , also makes innocuous , glennard 's god was a god of the living . of the immediate , the actual , the tangible ; all his days he had lived in the presence of that god .
the trouble was that i could not imagine anything about [female] and the brother of mrs. [female] . or , if you like , i could imagine anything which comes practically to the same thing . darkness and chaos are first cousins . i should have liked to ask the girl for a word which would give my imagination its line . but how was one to venture so far ? i can be rough sometimes but i am not naturally impertinent .
she consulted his taste and judgment on many points . she consented to resume , when she should be a little stronger , their visits to the churches and galleries . it would be a shame to go away from [female] without knowing them thoroughly . it came to her asking him to drive with her and imogene in the cascine . and when imogene made some excuse not to go , mrs. [male] did not postpone the drive .
indeed , only when i stood between it and the sun , was the blackness at all diminished . i was so bewildered -- stunned -- both by the event itself and its suddenness . that i could not at all realise to myself what it would be to have such a constant and strange attendance . but with a dim conviction that my present dislike would soon grow to loathing . i took my dreary way through the wood .
while he waited , mr. [male] employed his time to advantage . he carefully scrutinized his wardrobe , and after a process of elimination and substitution he packed his raiment in two trunks and was ready to leave the inn at ten minutes ', notice . between trains , when not engaged in watching the incoming travelers . he smoked a pipe over various packets of papers and letters . and these he burned with considerable care , all the french and german newspaper accounts of the murder of count [male] stroebel he read carefully .
what people , therefore , saw of her in a cursory view was very little . in truth , mainly something that was not she . the woman herself was a shadowy . conjectural creature who had little to do with the outlines presented to [female] eyes . a shape in the gloom , whose true description could only be approximated by putting together a movement now and a glance then .
[male] was also there , but his attention was wholly engrossed in the bright eyes and sunny face of [female] . who had recently returned from [location] , where she had been attending for the last two years . [female] was the only daughter of the mr. [male] . who was mentioned in the first chapter of this narrative , her father lived several miles from the city . but she had friends in town and spent much of her time there .
`` all right , professor -- it was worth it , '' he said , but the mountain lad shuffled silently away . an hour later [male] saw the boy with a swollen lip . one eye [male] and the other as [male] as ever . but after that there was no more trouble for june , [male] had made his promise good and gradually she came into the games with her fellows there after .
[female] sat nearby with his back against a tree trunk , occasionally he got up and walked to and fro to fight off the drowsiness that came over him . remembrance came to the very young man , and he sat up with a start . beside him his friends lay motionless . he looked around , still a little confused , and then his heart leaped into his throat . for at the edge of the woods he saw a small .
here , as in piccadilly , she could pick out the servant girls ; but here their service was yesterday 's lodging house . poor and dissipated girls , dressed in vague clothes fixed with hazardous pins . two young women strolled in front of her , they hung on each other 's arms , talking lazily . they had just come out of an eating house , and a happy digestion was in their eyes . the skirt on the outside was a soiled mauve .
this fight is given in great detail by my lord [male] from the particulars afforded him by [male] . but it differs in no great particular from other sea fights . and it is none of my purpose to surfeit you with such recitals . enough to say that it was stern and fierce , entailing great loss to both combatants . that cannon played little part in it , for knowing the quality of his men [male] made haste to run in and grapple .
they never wandered from that point while she sang . but as she ended they dropped for an instant on an eager . girlish countenance bending from a front seat . then , with her hasty little bow , she went quickly back among the children . who clapped and nodded as she passed , well pleased with the ballad she had sung .
on his way home from vorontsovo . as he was passing the bolotnoe place [male] . seeing a large crowd round the lobnoe place , stopped and got out of his trap . a french cook accused of being a spy was being flogged , the flogging was only just over . and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers .
people in barchester said that mrs. [female] was a [female] of mrs. [female] 's . but as mrs. [male] stoutly denied the connection , it may be supposed that the people of barchester were wrong . and , had mr. [female] 's wife in truth been a [female] . mrs. [male] would surely have provided for him during the many years in which the diocese had been in her hands . no such provision had been made , and mr. [female] .
the moment i had stolen my husband 's money and paid it to sandip . the music that was in our relations stopped , not only did i destroy all my own value by making myself cheap . but sandip 's powers , too , lost scope for their full play . you can not employ your marksmanship against a thing which is right in your grasp . so sandip has lost his aspect of the hero ; a tone of low quarrelsomeness has come into his words .
springing to her feet , she said : `` bring back what is lying there . '' jude was now aware that no message on any matter connected with her father 's business had prompted her signal to him . he set down his basket of tools . picked up the scrap of offal , beat a pathway for himself with his stick . and got over the hedge , they walked in parallel lines .
before this altar was placed a bier , and on each side of this bier kneeled three priests . who told their beads , and muttered their prayers , with the greatest signs of external devotion . for this service a splendid `` soul scat '' was paid to the convent of saint [male] 's by the mother of the deceased . and , that it might be fully deserved , the whole brethren , saving the lame sacristan . had transferred themselves to coningsburgh , where , while six of their number were constantly on guard in the performance of divine rites by the bier of athelstane .
the words of fagin ran through his mind as he watched the windows . how did they go -- as it came on dark . he began to think of all the men he had known who had died ... they rose up in quick succession , that he could hardly count them . yes , enrico 's last hours must be very like those spent by the old jew in his newgate cell .
[male] watched the black clothed form of the other man move out of the door . the bright head was gone , he turned over to sleep , in beldover . there was both for ursula and for [female] an interval . it seemed to ursula as if [female] had gone out of her for the time . he had lost his significance , he scarcely mattered in her world .
next morning a man arrived who wished to buy a bunch of [male] 's cattle . which were beginning to be famous , he stayed several days ; and when he left knight had business at the copper mine . business that concerned the sinking of a new shaft . which took him back and forth nearly every day for a week . by and by the cactus flowers began to fade , and [male] had never found an opportunity of mentioning them .
`` the king of [male] , '' he said . pointing to the portrait with a graceful gesture , `` admirable , '' with the natural capacity of an italian for changing the expression of his face at will . he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of pensive tenderness . he felt that what he now said and did would be historical , and it seemed to him that it would now be best for him . whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial globe .
monny looked excited , but firm , luckily , as she does it so often . it 's becoming to her to look firm , ( i have noticed that it 's not becoming to most girls . it squares their jaws and makes their eyes snap . ) but the spoiled daughter of the dead cannon king at her worst . merely looks pathetically earnest and minerva like , this , i suppose , is one of the `` little ways ''
she stood straight with her back against a tree 's trunk . her hands behind her , her eyes gazing before . she was tall and strong as young [female] ; under the shadow of her cavalier hat . her rich tinted face was in splendid gloom , it seeming gloom . not only because her hair was like night , and her long and wide eyes [female] .
whether it was that the harp strings were broken , the violin out of tune . or the flautist out of breath , so it chanced that the music had ceased . and the dancers come abruptly to a pause , all that [male] of rioters was dissolved as suddenly as it had been drawn together . in [male] 's remembrance the scene had a character of fantasy . it was as if a company of satyrs .
they were odd , they were uncertain , they had things one did not know about in the background of their lives and minds . literature and art were deeply respected in the [female] set . and mrs. [female] was always at pains to tell her children how much more agreeable and cultivated society had been when it included such figures as [location] . [organization] halleck and the poet of `` the culprit fay . '' the most celebrated authors of that generation had been `` gentlemen '' .
rosalind : for that first moment , when he 's interested . there is a moment -- oh , just before the first kiss , a whispered word . something that makes it worth while , [male] : then after that you make him talk about himself . pretty soon he thinks of nothing but being alone with you . he sulks , he wo not fight , he does not want to play , victory !
yet he had not complained ; he hardly ever complained , and scarcely had a day 's sickness from year to year . and as i watched him and [male] up the garden . i had noticed his free , firm gait , without the least sign of unsteadiness or weakness . besides , he was not one to keep any but a necessary secret from those who loved him . he could not be seriously ill , or we should have known it .
he was unusually absurd and ready , and all the time it seemed to [location] as a delightful possibility . as a thing not indeed to be entertained seriously , but to be half furtively felt . that he was being so agreeable because she had come back again , she returned home through a world that was as roseate as it had been gray overnight . but as she got out of the train at morningside park station she had a shock . she saw , twenty yards down the platform .
but this judicious arrangement as to properties , this well ordered alliance between families . had not perhaps suited her as well as it had suited him . i think that she might have learned to forget her early lover . or to look back upon it with a soft melancholy hardly amounting to regret , had her new lord been more tender in his ways with her . i do not know that lady [male] 's heart was made of that stern stuff which refuses to change its impressions .
`` you are still my wife , '' said soames . why he said that , what he meant by it . he knew neither when he spoke nor after , it was a truism almost preposterous . but its effect was startling , she rose from the window seat . and stood for a moment perfectly still , looking at him , he could see her bosom heaving .
all doubt of his identity was now at an end . his singular host evidently resided at [male] , the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of [organization] 's former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features . for the countess , after gazing with a puzzled look at his face . burst into a fit of laughter , and begged to know what had happened , `` countess , '' returned [organization] , totally unheeding her raillery , i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite .
till a swift terror broke the abrupt hour . the gold waves purled amidst the green above her ; and a bird sang . with one sharp taken breath , by sunlit branches and unshaken flower . the immortal limbs flashed to the human lover , and the immortal eyes to look on death . the damned ship lurched and slithered , quiet and quick my cold gorge rose ; the long sea rolled .
`` just as you please , mr. [male] , '' said the foreman . who thereupon retired from the office , leaving his master to meditate over the newspaper in solitude . it was a very bitter time for the poor brewer . he was one of those men whose spirit is not wanting to them while the noise and tumult of contest are around them . but who can not hold on by their own convictions in the quiet hours , he could storm .
now what the working of my mind was ( if , indeed it worked at all . and did not rather follow suit of body ) it is not in my power to say . only that the result of my adventure in the doone glen was to make me dream a good deal of nights . which i had never done much before , and to drive me , with tenfold zeal and purpose . to the practice of bullet shooting , not that i ever expected to shoot the doone family .
the human figures which completed this landscape , were in number two . partaking , in their dress and appearance , of that wild and rustic character . which belonged to the woodlands of the west riding of yorkshire at that early period . the eldest of these men had a stern , savage , and wild aspect . his garment was of the simplest form imaginable .
the quick falling twilight had now given sudden coolness and [male] to the desert . the flies had ceased their persecutions , the whole air was blue as the light seen through a pale star sapphire . for the western sky was veiled with a film of cloud floating up out of the sunset like the smoke of its fire . and there was no glow of red , as the two friends made themselves ready for dinner . and talked of such adventures as each had just passed through , they heard the voice of the landlord .
but what his whole being impelled him to , was to throw himself upon his knees before her like a boy . to lay his face upon her little hands which rested open upon her lap . and to cry to her that there were hours when he could bear no more . and could it have been that if he had so done she would have bent her dear head and wept . for her voice , when she answered him .
the worst was that on arriving in [location] he found he could not get the rooms he was used to . where they made him as comfortable as such a confirmed sea dog as himself could be anywhere on shore . in the effort to subdue by dint of talking and to keep in check the mysterious . the profound attraction he felt already for that delicate being of flesh and blood . with pale cheeks , with darkened eyelids and eyes scalded with hot tears .
peter threw his left arm around mickey even as he shook hands with his right . you surely do , he said , by law and by love . to the bottom of all our hearts , the visit was a notable success . the buttermilk was cold , the spice cake was fresh . the apples and peaches were juicy .
having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic arrangements . the count grew quite tranquil , half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the sokolniki field . no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering what was to come , he was driving to the yauza bridge where he had heard that kutuzov was . count rostopchin was mentally preparing the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to kutuzov for his deception . he would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the ruin of [location] would fall upon his doting old head .
the father fluttered about , flew away , then came back , bearing in his beak food and kisses . the dawning day gilded this happy thing , the great law . `` multiply , '' lay there smiling and august , and that sweet mystery unfolded in the glory of the morning . [female] , with her hair in the sunlight . her soul absorbed in chimeras , illuminated by love within and by the dawn without .
when he had made his offer he had known nothing of mr maguire 's offer . nor had [male] then told him of it . such reticence on her part of course released him from his bond . so lady ball argued , and against this argument her son made no demur . indeed it was hardly possible that he should comprehend exactly what had taken place between his [male] and mr maguire .
higgins , do not you dare try this game on me . i taught it to you ; and it does not take me in . get up and come home ; and do not be a fool , eliza takes a piece of needlework from her basket . and begins to stitch at it , without taking the least notice of this outburst , [female] . you let her alone , mother . let her speak for herself .
at twenty minutes before nine lady [female] would always be in the dining room to make the tea and open the post bag . and as she was always there alone , she knew more about other people 's letters than other people ever knew about hers . when these operations were over she rang the bell . and the servants of the family , who by that time had already formed themselves into line in the hall . would march in , and settle themselves on benches prepared for them near the side board .
molly had scarcely time to answer before she herself was led off by her partner . she could hardly attend to him or to the figures of the quadrille for watching for [female] among the moving forms . once she caught a glimpse of her standing still . downcast -- listening to mr. [male] 's eager speech . again she was walking languidly among the dancers , almost as if she took no notice of those around her .
he had had to acknowledge that it might be , but he had been quite emphatic over the fact that most people did not drop it . after a long time he slept in his chair . the spring wind came in through the opened window . and fluttered the leaves of the old prayer book on the stand . the week that followed was an anxious one , [male] 's physical condition slowly improved .
from the sledge he took a blanket and wrapped kazan in it . and carried him a hundred yards back from the trail . with bowed head he came behind his four dogs into god 's house . half an hour later he turned back into the wilderness with his supplies . it was dark when he returned to where he had left kazan .
that the unpopularity at school would follow him through life . when he went home for the christmas holidays he was so despondent that his father sent him to a nerve specialist . when he returned to andover he arranged to arrive late so that he could be alone in the bus during the drive from station to school . of course when he had learned to keep his mouth shut every one promptly forgot all about him . the next autumn , with his realization that consideration for others was the discreet attitude .
this splendid costume , on which the light played , seemed glazed with flame on every fold . the man who wore it had his armorial bearings embroidered on his breast in vivid colors . a chevron accompanied by a deer passant . the shield was flanked , on the right by an olive branch . on the left by a deer 's antlers , this man wore in his girdle a rich dagger whose hilt .
it was saturated with the sense of ancient . stable , sane tradition , it breathed an atmosphere in which nothing violent or strange or abnormal could ever flourish . she felt that , in contrast with their restless modern cotswold home . its intense normality must surely have some subtle reassuring effect upon her son . gazing over those yellow fields in the early morning she felt a more settled happiness than she had ever known since her husband 's death .
all through that day and night the power of her [female] 's white arm was the thing which saved him from dashing out his brains . the two men could not have held him , and at his greatest frenzy they observed that now and then his bloodshot eye would glance aside at the beauteous face above him . the sound of the word [male] had struck upon his brain and wakened an echo , those words `` his [male] and i '' put a new face upon the matter , and all was done that lay within the man 's skill .
my old governess had foreseen it , as well as i . and therefore led him into a room which had not a bed in it . and yet had a chamber within it which had a bed . whither we withdrew for the rest of the night . and , in short , after some time being together , he went to bed .
then they put spears in rest and ran together so fiercely that they smote either other down . horse and all , anon they pulled out their swords and lashed together as men that were wild and courageous . thus they fought more than half a day , and either was wounded passing sore . so that the blood ran down freshly from them upon the ground . by then sir [male] waxed more fresh than sir [organization] , and better winded , and bigger .
staring down in [male] , lanyard told himself gravely : `` blue water below that , my friend ! '' it seemed difficult to credit the fact that they had made the flight from [location] in so short a time . by his reckoning -- a very rough one -- the parrott was then somewhere off dieppe . it ought to pick up england , in such case . not far from brighton , if only one could see ... , by bending forward a little and staring past the aviator lanyard could catch a glimpse of [female] shannon .
when you are better you shall go away and get something to eat . what sort of a passage did you have coming over ? maisie was crying more subduedly , for the first time in her life glad that she had something to lean against . [female] patted her on the shoulder tenderly but clumsily . for he was not quite sure where her shoulder might be , she drew herself out of his arms at last and waited .
i explained to him as well as i could . but very shortly -- for i was terribly wearied , and only persuaded to talk at all through fear of offending one so powerful if i refused to do so . what were the properties of gunpowder , and he instantly suggested that i should illustrate what i said by operating on the person of one of the prisoners . one , he said , never would be counted , and it would not only be very interesting to him . but would give me the opportunity of an instalment of revenge .
[female] , my natural modesty forbids me to believe that you could mean these [female] things that you say to a . such its i am -- and therefore i allowed myself to fancy that you overrate or . as it is called , flatter , [female] . where did you learn to use words like that ? have you frequented the theatres much ? [female] . my father was a deputy under the public prosecutor . and i saw miss [female] as a child .
so king mark came into england . where he soon became known as the most horrible coward that ever bestrode horse . and there was much laughing and jesting at the knight of cornwall . and much he was despised , sir dagonet , king [male] 's fool . at one time chased him through thick and thin over the forests .
it was too great a shock to be borne with calmness . and she immediately left the room , [female] was disappointed too . but at the same time her regard for colonel brandon ensured his welcome with her . and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him . she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him .
indifferently he took it up and turned to the market reports . reading the comments from the [location] correspondent through carefully . then he read half a report of a divorce case . then -- he read the paragraph that had caused his nephew by marriage to laugh for ten minutes in the union hotel at penzance . but the news that the flower of [organization] were following up with a keen interest the movements of himself .
delvile then bowed to her with a look that accused her of insincerity . and the carriage drove away , she was received by mrs harrel with the same coldness with which she had parted from her . that lady appeared now to have some uneasiness upon her mind , and [female] endeavoured to draw from her its cause . but far from seeking any alleviation in friendship , she studiously avoided her . seeming pained by her conversation , and reproached by her sight , [female] perceived this encreasing reserve with much concern .
`` why not ? '' trevelyan could perceive at once that the authority which he had once respected had gone from the man . bozzle away from his own home , out on business , with his coat buttoned over his breast . and his best hat in his hand , was aware that he commanded respect . and he could carry himself [male] . he knew himself to be somebody .
above and beyond such commonplace beauties as these , the beauties of tenderness . truth , faith , earnestness , hope and charity . were enthroned upon her broad white brow , and crowned her queen by right divine of womanly perfection . a loving and devoted daughter , an affectionate sister . a true and faithful friend , an untiring benefactress to the poor , a gentle [female] .
on the following day master huckaback , with some show of mystery . demanded from my mother an escort into a dangerous part of the world . to which his business compelled him , my mother made answer to this that he was kindly welcome to take our [male] fry with him . at which the good clothier laughed , and said that [male] was nothing like big enough . but another [male] must serve his turn , not only for his size .
crouching in that hollow nest , as children get together in ever so little compass . i saw a dozen fierce men come down . on the other side of the water , not bearing any fire arms , but looking lax and jovial . as if they were come from riding and a dinner taken hungrily , `` queen , queen ! '' they were shouting , here and there , and now and then : `` where the pest is our little queen gone ? ''
leontes , whilst i remember her and her virtues . i can not forget my blemishes in them . and so still think of the wrong i did myself : which was so much that heirless it hath made my kingdom . and destroy would the sweet'st companion that e'er man bred his hopes out of , [male] . true , too true , my lord ; if , one by one , you wedded all the world .
he watched and listened , the water rippled behind his canoe . it trickled in a soothing cadence after each dip of his paddle . he heard the gentle murmur of it among the reeds and grasses . and now and then the gurgling laughter of it , like the faintest tinkling of dainty bells . he had never understood it before ; he had never joined in its happiness .
he said that a few days after i had secretly disappeared . two men and a woman , returning home from a distant place where they had been on a visit to a relation . stopped at the village , these travellers related that two days journey from ytaioa they had met three persons travelling in an opposite direction . an old man with a white beard , followed by two yellow dogs .
if he had left the village on foot . under cover of darkness , he might have left unseen . but he must have entered some other village at daybreak . he must sooner or later have procured some kind of conveyance . and wherever he went , carrying with him that stolen child .
such was the scene in the castle yard at coningsburgh when it was entered by [male] and his followers . the seneschal or steward deigned not to take notice of the groups of inferior guests who were perpetually entering and withdrawing . unless so far as was necessary to preserve order ; nevertheless he was struck by the good mien of the monarch and ivanhoe . more especially as he imagined the features of the latter were familiar to him . besides , the approach of two knights .
already a grand panorama of glaciers and peaks was unfolding itself . a cloudless sky promised a lovely august day . and what that means in the high alps the mountaineer alone can tell , but spencer turned his back on the outer glory . he had eyes only for [female] . while she , looking mistily at the giant rock across the valley .
do you think i could believe it without proof ? i tell you i have lain awake all last night . fitting matters one into the other , i did not hear about padley till last night . and it gave me all that i needed . i tell you topcliffe hath cast his foul eyes on padley and coveted it .
`` look'ee , the little emmets crawling , '' he said . pointing to them , and he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun . they mowed two more rows ; the old man stopped . `` come , master , dinner time ! '' he said briskly , and on reaching the stream the mowers moved off across the lines of cut grass towards their pile of coats .
since his father 's death , and according to mr. [male] . [male] son had only arrived in england after the old man 's death . or stay , the lawyer had declared that he had been only aware of [male] 's return within the last two or three weeks . that was a different thing , of course ; yet was it likely this man could have returned . and his father 's lawyer have remained ignorant of his arrival ?
whilst she was getting well she occupied herself much in seeking a name for her daughter . first she went over all those that have italian endings , such as [female] . [female] , [location] , [female] ; she liked galsuinde pretty well . and [female] or [organization] still better , [female] wanted the child to be called after her mother . emma opposed this , they ran over the calendar from end to end .
this done , he returned to the room where [male] was . carried a chair into the passage , bade [male] lock the door . sat down , revolver in hand , and himself went to sleep . young bernenstein was in bed just now , taken faint . and the constable himself was acting as his substitute ; that was to be the story .
the tables , of white scrubbed wood , were placed round three sides of the room . as in a gasthaus , [male] and ursula sat with their backs to the wall . which was of oiled wood , and [male] and [male] sat in the corner next them . near to the stove , it was a fairly large place . with a tiny bar , just like a country inn .
he looked at his watch , and finding that it was half past nine got up and went into the writing room . there he wrote a few lines , and ordered a messenger to take a cab to the [male] house and wait for the answer . he then sat down behind another newspaper and tried to calculate how long it would take a cab to get to the [male] house . `` the lady was out , sir , '' he suddenly heard a waiter 's voice at his elbow . and he stammered : `` out ? -- '' as if it were a word in a strange language .
would her remorse have maintained its power within her . or would she have felt absolved by secrecy , if it had not been for that outer conscience which was made for her by [male] ? it is hard to say how much we could forgive ourselves if we were secure from judgment by another whose opinion is the breathing medium of all our joy . who brings to [male] with close pressure and immediate sequence that judgment of the invisible and universal which self flattery and the world 's tolerance would easily melt and disperse . in this way our brother may be in the stead of god to us .
no , the sea is not a gentle place , it must be the very hardness of the life that makes all sea people hard . of course , captain west is unaware that his crew exists . and mr. [male] and mr. [male] never address the men save to give commands . but miss west , who is more like myself , a passenger , ignores the men . she does not even say good morning to the man at the wheel when she first comes on deck .
and now i was indeed in the height of what i might call my prosperity . and i wanted nothing but to be a wife , which , however , could not be in this case . there was no room for it ; and therefore on all occasions i studied to save what i could . as i have said above , against a time of scarcity . knowing well enough that such things as these do not always continue ; that men that keep mistresses often change them .
his shanty stood midway in the gap , high from the road . set against a dark clump of pines and roared at by the river beneath . everybody knew he sold whiskey . but he was too shrewd to be caught , until , late one afternoon , two days after young [male] 's arrest . [male] coming through the gap into town glimpsed a skulking figure with a hand barrel as it slipped from the dark pines into caliban 's cabin .
racing was an amusement to which english noblemen had been addicted for many ages . and had been held to be serviceable rather than disgraceful , if conducted in a noble fashion . he did not credit [male] with much nobility . he knew but little about the [male] , he would much have preferred that his son should have owned a horse alone . if he must have anything to do with ownership .
it occurred to him , of course . that carhart was trying him out , [male] 's report on his handling of this might be a factor in something big for him . but even without that he would have done his best to put the thing through . ten years in [location] had not made him sentimental and he was quite accustomed to finish everything he began . and a little bit more , all went well at first , there was no enthusiasm .
to sacrifice my hopes and relieve the two poor women forever of the oppression of my intercourse . then i reflected that i had better try a short absence first , for i must already have had a sense that in disappearing completely it would not be merely my own hopes that i should condemn to extinction . it would perhaps be sufficient if i stayed away long enough to give the elder lady time to think she was rid of me . that she would wish to be rid of me after this ( if i was not rid of her ) . was now not to be doubted : that nocturnal scene would have cured her of the disposition to put up with my company for the sake of my dollar .
what did she mean to say to him when he came ? now and then , as she sat there , the sense of his presence enveloped her as in her dream . and she shut her eyes and felt his arms about her . then she woke to reality and shivered , a long time elapsed . and at length she said to herself : `` he is not coming . ''
he was occupied with the preparations for [male] 's departure and was seeking to gain time . in the first place he himself furbished a sword . which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath ; he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt . then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of [male] . called olivain , the lackey who had followed him from [male] .
[female] had assured her that there would be no violation of decency in their paying a visit . the little party of three -- to the sights of the metropolis . but mrs. [female] took a different view , like many ladies of her country who had lived a long time in [location] . she had completely lost her native tact on such points . and in her reaction , not in itself deplorable , against the liberty allowed to young persons beyond the seas .
your woman 's weakness when i asked ye to jine us . that 's how it was i suppose , but the tranter appeared to have heard some such words from his wife before . and hence his answer had not the energy it might have shown if the inquiry had possessed the charm of novelty . the discourse was cut short by the sudden appearance of [male] on the scene . with a face and hands of hideous blackness .
the gasping voice trailed wearily and the face , turning from me . lay still upon the pillow , presently i saw miss white start and come closer . the short , quick breath had stopped , at mrs. [female] 's front door [female] . holding the sleeping child in his arms , looked at me . `` what are you going to do with her ? '' his voice was uncertain .
day was breaking at plashwater weir mill lock . stars were yet visible , but there was dull light in the east that was not the light of night . the moon had gone down , and a mist crept along the banks of the river . seen through which the trees were the ghosts of trees . and the water was the ghost of water .
that purpose was no less firm in the heart of [male] . and he turned away from the grave , sick with the trick that fate had lost no time in playing him . for he was a falin now in the eyes of both factions and an enemy . even to june , the weeks dragged slowly along , and june sank slowly toward the depths with every fresh realization of the trap of circumstance into which she had fallen . she had dim memories of just such a state of affairs when she was a child .
the measure had been taken on the sunday , that was evidence . then they examined [female] pope over and over again . and extracted from the poor girl an admission that she loved [female] better than anything in the whole wide world . if he were to be in prison , she would not object to go to prison with him . if he were to be hung , she would wish to be hung with him .
`` oh , no , no , i declare it is not , '' cried the young girl . while [female] turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her disaster . the youth looked pleased , he again took in his strong arms the little girl . whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder . and placed her gently in the carriage ; then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a first rate esquire .
another and yet another creature of the same kind sprang from a second door and a third . more hugging , more kissing , more outcries . and tears of joy , he could not distinguish which was papa . which [male] , and which petya , everyone shouted . talked , and kissed him at the same time , only his mother was not there .
[female] had been born and bred a conservative , whereas the duke of omnium was well known as a consistent whig . there is no one so devoutly resolved to admit of no superior as your conservative . born and bred , no one so inclined to high domestic despotism as your thoroughgoing consistent old whig . when he had proceeded about six miles , [male] was picked up by his friends . but even then his anger had hardly cooled , `` was the duke as civil as ever when you took your leave of him ? ''
ah , you business men ! you business men ! i said reproachfully , i wished to call him a blackguard then and there . and it was on my tongue to do so , but i concluded that to wait until he had shown his hand fully was the better game . the ladies entered the car and i shook hands with [male] .
about a week after these measures had been taken , one night . as the superintendent of the watch , who had been inspecting the lower dormitory in the batiment neuf . was about to drop his chestnut in the box -- this was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their duties punctually . every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all the boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories . a watchman looked through the peep hole of the dormitory and beheld brujon sitting on his bed and writing something by the light of the hall lamp .
[male] had the best of it , at any rate he talked the longest . but i do hope he is not a radical , no country gentleman ought to be a radical . ought he , dear ? mrs. [female] says you are to get the lozenges at squire 's in oxford street . and be sure to ask for the vade mecum lozenges . she is all in a flutter about the hounds .
his mastery of meters was very great ; and , if the beauty of a drama depended upon the variety of measures in which the personages speak . rodney 's plays must have challenged the works of [female] . [location] 's ignorance of [female] did not prevent her from feeling fairly certain that plays should not produce a sense of chill stupor in the audience . such as overcame her as the lines flowed on . sometimes long and sometimes short , but always delivered with the same lilt of voice .
seating herself in the grass , she began to pull daisies . singing idly the while , as if unconscious of the spirited prancings of the horse . presently he drew nearer , sniffing curiously and eyeing her with surprise , she took no notice . but plaited the daisies and sang on as if he was not there . this seemed to pique the petted creature , for , slowly approaching , he came at length so close that he could smell her little foot and nibble at her dress .
the outer part of the wood on my side was very open . composed in most part of dwarf trees that grow on stony soil . and scattered thorny bushes bearing a yellow pea shaped blossom . presently i came to thicker wood , where the trees were much taller and in greater variety . and after this came another sterile strip , like that on the edge of the wood where stone cropped out from the ground and nothing grew except the yellow flowered thorn bushes .
if a searcher could have got at the inside spirit of the woman . that searcher would have found that she wished to go right , -- that she did make . or at any rate promise to herself that she would make . certain struggles to attain decency and propriety . but it was so natural to her to torment those whose misfortune brought them near to her .
it must be an amusing study . when i am in the country i never wish to leave it . and when i am in town it is pretty much the same . they have each their advantages and i am equally happy in either , ay -- that is because you have the right disposition . [ looking at darcy , ] but that gentleman seemed to think the country was nothing at all .
wonderful effects of light and shadow . picturesque masses , composed of detached buildings so far distant that they seemed huddled together . grim factories turned to beautiful palaces by the dazzling reflection of sunlight from their window panes . great ships seeming in the distance to be toy boats floating idly ; -- with no sign of life perceptible . the whole scene recalled the fairy stories .
i am , by nature , a cautious man . and prone to look at the dark side of every prospect and the risks of every enterprise . but i could not see what better dispositions were possible against the attack that threatened us . yet i was sorely uneasy concerning mr. [male] . now , after all our stir and runnings to and fro , came an hour or two of [male] .
with that , bannon called up the general offices of the [male] and [male] and asked for mr. [male] . there was some little delay in getting the connection , and then three or four minutes of fencing while a young man at the other end of the line tried to satisfy himself that bannon had the right to ask for mr. [male] . let alone to talk with him , and bannon , steadily ignoring his questions . continued blandly requesting him to call mr. [male] to the telephone . [female] was listening with interest , for bannon 's manner was different from anything she had ever seen in him before .
`` she can do no better than stay where she is , '' returned [female] , releasing the hand , and laying her own lightly on miss [female] 's curls . and then to [male] : `` from [male] , sir ? '' in an irresolute way , and stealing a clumsy look at her . [female] rose to place a chair for her , and then returned to his own .
he carried me off , much against my will , for i had a great wish to see again that fresh young face . so earnest , cheerful , and good , also , as i laboured in vain to convince my companion . the said face indicated an independent dignity which would doubtless make its owner perfectly indifferent whether her solitary walk were crossed by two gentlemen or two hundred . [male] to this ; nevertheless , he was inexorable , and , since he was `` a man of the world '' having , in his journeys up and down the country for my father .
he had at last found himself clear of marygreen and [location] . he was out of his apprenticeship , and with his tools at his back seemed to be in the way of making a new start . the start to which , barring the interruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with [male] . he had been looking forward for about ten years , jude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible . meditative , and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance , he was of dark complexion .
after the lapse of a few seconds , the room and the opposite wall were lighted up with a fierce . red , tremulous glow , everything was on fire . the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the chamber . as the knapsack was consumed , together with the hideous rags which it contained . it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes .
almost at once the acute pain passed and his shoulder grew cold and numb and sticky . he faltered in his stride and all but fell , but the sight of the doorway gave him courage and again he stumbled on . [male] came to his senses to find himself in a dimly lit chamber . with the face of the princess galva . white and drawn , bending over him , and her cool hand on his forehead .
first there marched four officers of the jeddak 's guard bearing a huge salver on which reposed . upon a cushion of scarlet silk . a great golden chain with a collar and padlock at each end . directly behind these officers came four others carrying a similar salver which supported the magnificent ornaments of a prince and princess of the reigning house of zodanga . at the foot of the throne these two parties separated and halted .
she trifled a long time with this last bottle . holding it up to the light , and even removing the stopper and smelling the sickly liquid . but she put it from her suddenly with a shudder . if i could , she muttered , if i could only do it ! and yet why should i now ? she clinched her small hands as she uttered the last words .
the pillars at either side of the gate were of huge dimensions and were higher than i could reach . an intelligent forester had cleared the wood in the school grounds . which were of the same general character as the glenarm estate . the little gothic church near at hand was built of stone similar to that used in glenarm house . as i surveyed the scene a number of young women came from one of the school buildings and .
he does make me angry , because he wants to banish the beggars and poor men who sell things in the street . instead of letting me give and buy , what am i for , with all my money . except to do things for people ? and it 's such fun making them happy by saying `` i want a cat necklace -- '' or a scarab , or whatever they have , instead of pushing past with a stony glare as if they were dust under our feet . of course we are attended by great crowds whereever we go .
but as she sat there amid her guests , she felt the old ennui overtaking her . the hopelessness which so often assailed her , which came upon her like an obsession . like something extraneous , independent of volition , it was something which announced itself . a chill breath that seemed to issue from some vast cavern wherein discords waited . there came over her the acute longing which always summoned into her spiritual vision the presence of the beloved one .
the groom marveled at the sudden changes of [location] . the gallops that fell abruptly to a walk with the alterations of mood in the girl 's heart . the pauses that marked a moment of meditation as she watched some green curving bank . or a plunge of the mad little creek that sent a glory of spray whitely into the sunlight . it grew late and the shadows of waning afternoon crept through the park .
from time to time he passed a knot of silent soldiers , who saluted . they might have been the very men who had carried him on their backs when he was in his first knickerbockers . a faint light burned in his room . and , as he entered , hands clasped his feet . and a voice murmured from the floor , `` who is it ? ''
but all this was nothing ; i found no encouraging prospect , i waited . i lived regularly , and with as much frugality as became my circumstances , but nothing offered . nothing presented , and the main stock wasted apace . what to do i knew not ; the terror of approaching poverty lay hard upon my spirits . i had some money , but where to place it i knew not .
if these things did not compose as beautiful a picture as that which the little girl had carried so long in her mind . she had no more reason to be sorry than the rest of us . and had been no more foolish than other dreamers , i think she had built her airy castle too much after the model of a last scene in a pantomime . and that she expected to find spangled waters twinkling in perpetual [female] . revolving fountains , ever expanding sunflowers , and gilded clouds of rose coloured gauze .
this comet against which pope calixtus . uncle of borgia , ordered public prayers . is the same which reappeared in 1835 , and not only had messire [male] his special court as provost and [location] of [location] . but in addition he had a share . both for eye and tooth , in the grand court of the king .
the garden was surrounded by a high wall , and [male] contemplated it first through the rusty scroll work of a tall iron gate . surmounted by the arms and monogram of the original owner . on one side of the house there was a vast pile of building . comprising stables and coach houses , barns and granaries . arranged in a quadrangle , the gate leading into this quadrangle was open .
one day , a week from christmas . he had occasion to ride to helston on some trifling affair . for half a week a blizzard had whirled about the coast . and he had been kept chafing indoors what time layer upon layer of snow was spread upon the countryside . on the fourth day , the storm being spent , the sun came forth .
as might be expected in a woman of considine 's choice . mrs. [female] was capable and , as luck would have it . she was also kindly , all the domestic arrangements at lapton ran smoothly under her direction . she was reasonably popular with the boys and mothered them . she even found time to mother gabrielle .
he waited quietly for that appointed quadrille , declining a dance in which lady [male] would have enlisted him . and keeping a close watch upon clarissa during the interval . what a gay butterfly creature she seemed to night ! he could scarcely fancy this was the same girl who had spoken so mournfully of her lost home in the library that afternoon . he looked from her to his daughter for a moment .
among these the comtesse [female] tournay [female] basserive . but lately arrived from [location] , was a most conspicuous figure : dressed in deep . heavy [female] silk , with only a white lace kerchief to relieve the aspect of mourning about her person . she sat beside lady portarles , who was vainly trying by witty sallies and somewhat broad jokes . to bring a smile to the comtesse 's sad mouth .
full of dreams , and always with anticipations ahead , no matter how far short realizations fell . he was an optimist , a lover of the sun and the moon and the stars . a worshiper of the forests and of the mountains . a man who loved his life , and who had fought for it . and yet who was ready -- at the last -- to yield it up without a whimper when the fates asked for it .
she had anchored between the isle of amber and the main land . inside the chain of reefs which encircles the island . and which she had passed through in a place where no vessel had ever passed before . she presented her head to the waves that rolled in from the open sea . and as each billow rushed into the narrow strait where she lay .
[female] promised that she would do her best , not , however , taking much immediate comfort from the prospects of dear [female] . lady [female] certainly had never in her life spoken of dear [female] while the wicked [female] was alive . then [female] also made her little speech . dear [male] , i will do all that i can . pray try to believe in me , but [male] was so much the hero of the hour .
but when , after a sleep , which , although dreamless , yet left behind it a sense of past blessedness . i awoke in the full morning , i found , indeed , that the room was still my own . but that it looked abroad upon an unknown landscape of forest and hill and [male] on the one side . and on the other , upon the marble court , with the great fountain , the crest of which now flashed glorious in the sun . and cast on the pavement beneath a shower of faint shadows from the waters that fell from it into the marble basin below .
but the hope which always springs up with love was not weakened in lothario by this repelling demeanour . on the contrary his passion for [female] increased , and she discovering in him what she had never expected . knew not what to do ; and considering it neither safe nor right to give him the chance or opportunity of speaking to her again . she resolved to send , as she did that very night . one of her servants with a letter to [female] .
if i rise from a chair , and let it remain where i have been sitting . he carefully restores it to its proper place against the wall . he picks up stray flower blossoms from the carpet . and mutters to himself as discontentedly as if they were hot cinders burning holes in it . and he storms at the servants if there is a crease in the tablecloth .
felipe rode away with a sad heart , but his purpose did not falter , following straight down the river road to the sea . he then kept up along the coast , asking here and there , cautiously , if persons answering to the description of alessandro and ramona had been seen . no one had seen any such persons , when , on the night of the second day . he rode up to the santa [male] mission . the first figure he saw was the venerable father salvierderra sitting in the corridor .
while one waiting at the tent door beheld with new eyes a young man . beautiful as [location] , a god in a halo of golden dust . walking slowly at the head of his flocks , while at his knee ran small naked cupids . but she laughed -- [female] , in a slate coloured blouse . laughed consumedly till [male] , putting the best face he could upon the matter .
`` i think i must not do that , saints favour those who can keep secrets , '' said [male] , teasingly , yet he made his wish in earnest . after turning over several in his mind , to ask for his own future happiness . in spite of obstacles which would prove the marabout 's power . was the most intelligent thing to do ; but somehow the desire clamouring loudest at the moment was for victoria .
people still say that i am rather pretty , angel ( handsome is the word they use . since i wish to be truthful ) , perhaps i am what they say , but i do not value my good looks . i only like to have them because they belong to you . my dear , and that there may be at least one thing about me worth your having . so much have i felt this , that when i met with annoyance on account of the same .
it was , no doubt , [male] to see mr lupex in his present mood . much pleasanter than in that other mood of which blood would have been the consequence . but [male] as he now was , it was . nevertheless , apparent that he was not quite sober . cradell , therefore , did not settle the day for the little dinner .
but , as i think i observed before at the outset of this story . we are rarely ourselves aware of the commencement of any new section in our lives . it is only after the fact that we recognise the awful importance which actions . in themselves most trivial , assume by reason of their consequences . and when the action , in itself so unimportant , in its consequences so fatal .
but as he was making this artless confession i said to myself that . whatever consequences and complications he might have imagined . the complication from which he was suffering now could never , never have presented itself to his mind . slow but sure ( for i conceive that the book of destiny has been written up from the beginning to the last page ) . it had been coming for something like six years .
gerhardt , who was given to speculation these days . passed by the window without looking up , he put his wooden buck down . and , hanging his saw on a nail on the side of the house , came in . `` mother , '' he called , in german , and , then not seeing her . he came to the door of the front room and looked in .
they followed the line of the quai . which they had gained on quitting the rue saint honore , where they left [male] . [male] went first ; his elbow , his wrist . his shoulder formed three wedges which he knew how to insinuate with skill into the groups . to make them split and separate like firewood , he made use sometimes of the hilt of his sword as an additional help .
there was a fall , where the water slid over rocks with a smoothness so unbroken that it looked solid except just at one point . there a spur stood sharply up , and the river broke back upon itself in an amber wave through which the sun shone . opposite this spur they sat for a long while . talking at times , but for the most part listening to the roar of the water and watching its perpetual flow . and at last the sunset came , and the long shadows , they stood up .
he left her alone only when he went skiing . a sport he loved , and which she did not practise . the he seemed to sweep out of life , to be a projectile into the beyond . and often , when he went away , she talked to the little german sculptor . they had an invariable topic , in their art .
about five minutes later , [male] returned , followed by an elderly jew . in a dirty , threadbare gaberdine , worn greasy across the shoulders . his red hair , which he wore after the fashion of the polish jews . with the corkscrew curls each side of his face . was plentifully sprinkled with grey -- a general coating of grime .
to understand exactly the catastrophe that had occurred , it is necessary to follow briefly an outline of the process after the logs have been piled on the banks . there they remain until the break up attendant on spring shall flood the stream to a freshet . the rollways are then broken , and the saw logs floated down the river to the mill where they are to be cut into lumber . if for any reason this transportation by water is delayed until the flood goes down . the logs are stranded or left in pools , consequently every logger puts into the two or three weeks of freshet water a feverish activity which shall carry his product through before the ebb .
when , however , his father died , that broken head served him in good stead . his sufferings in the cause were made the most of ; these , in unison with his father 's merits . turned the scale , and it was [male] decided . at a meeting held at the [male] and dragon . at barchester , that [male] gresham should fill his father 's shoes .
my poor governess was utterly disconsolate , and she that was my comforter before . wanted comfort now herself ; and sometimes mourning . sometimes raging , was as much out of herself , as to all outward appearance . as any mad woman in bedlam , nor was she only disconsolate as to me . but she was struck with horror at the sense of her own wicked life .
one evening -- [female] was in her dressing room . writing , i believe , to [female] ; she had left me in the library . reading -- [male] came in ; he sat down . i was about to withdraw ; he requested me to remain . gently , yet in a manner which showed he wished compliance .
he did not look at the fire , but paced back and forth with the same step . all at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks . which shone vaguely on the chimney piece , through the glow , there was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape . and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal . he bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment .
after that one bitter speech and that one dreary sigh . mr. [male] made no overt attempt to influence his daughter 's decision . he had a more scientific game to play , and he knew how to play it . peevish remonstrances might have availed nothing ; threats or angry speeches might have provoked a spirit of defiance . mr. [male] neither complained nor threatened ; he simply collapsed .
ursula laughed , and repeated the welcome , she was so happy herself . she longed to distribute her happiness , they walked . the children following , towards the house , under the great walnut tree , by the sunk fence which guarded the flower garden from the sheep and cows . mrs. [female] stopped and pointed down the green slope of the field . across the valley , to the wooded hills opposite , `` is not it a pretty view ? ''
gratefully [organization] accepted both offers , finding it less humiliating to be helped by women than by friends of his own sex . this work would support him in a frugal way . and certain musical drudgery promised by his master assured his own teaching . delighted with the success of their little plot , these friendly neighbours left him with cheery words . warm hand grasps , and faces beaming with feminine satisfaction at the hearty kiss [organization] put on each faded cheek .
we were taken to a dimly lighted room in which many people were waiting . some with bandages over their eyes , others with all kinds of extraordinary spectacles on . which made them look like phantoms out of a bad dream . nearly all more or less blind , and the effect was surprisingly depressing , an hour 's wandering in the hofgarten . my first view of the rhine -- a dull .
the chalet , without cows or dairy . is separated from the roadway by a wooden fence whose palings are hidden under a luxuriant hedge . on the other side of the road the opposite house . subject to a legal privilege , has a similar hedge and paling . so as to leave an unobstructed view of havre to the chalet .
`` i did not prick you , did i ? '' she asked . looking at me with those large eyes of hers which seemed to speak of such goodness of heart . `` no , '' i said ; yet i felt the prick of that needle even then . then we went on dancing , i distinguished myself marvellously . with a needle prick in my knee , and another who knows where , i whirled [female] three times round the room .
jo helps me with the sewing . and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs . i should be afraid she might overdo , if i did not know her `` moral fit '' would not last long , beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock . and never forgets what you told her , she grieves about father .
he hurried swiftly in the direction of the sound . and found the trembling girl just attempting to climb the steep , in order to escape in any way from the dreadful gloom of the valley . he stepped , however , lovingly in her path , and bold and proud as her resolve had before been . she now felt only too keenly the delight , that the friend whom she so passionately loved should rescue her from this frightful solitude . and that the joyous life in the castle should be again open to her , she followed almost unresisting .
[female] 's scoldings had died away , the queen . wrapped in her furs , sat sometimes on a seat , but oftener paced restlessly to and fro . evening had fallen , we did not know what to do , nor even whether we ought to do anything . [male] would not own to sharing our worst apprehensions , but his gloomy silence in face of our surmises witnessed that he was in his heart as [male] as we were . for my part i had come to the end of my endurance .
he watched the dilapidated five barred gate swing to after the departure of mrs. [female] and her attendant . and then went to look at his horse , the patient animal had been standing in a shed all this time . and had had neither food nor water , [male] searched amongst the empty barns and outhouses . and found a few handfuls of fodder , he took this to the animal . and then went back again to the garden , -- to that quiet garden , where the bees were buzzing about in the [male] with a drowsy .
in the mean time the gerhardt family struggled along as before , they were poor . indeed , but gerhardt was willing to face poverty if only it could be endured with honor . the grocery bills were of the same size , however . the children 's clothing was steadily wearing out , economy had to be practised . and payments stopped on old bills that gerhardt was trying to adjust .
what could she have done to have deserved so terrible a punishment ? [female] . something awful ! she married a mortal , fleta . oh ! is it injudicious to marry a mortal ? [female] . injudicious ? it strikes at the root of the whole fairy system ! by our laws , the fairy who marries a mortal dies , [female] .
we slept till far into the afternoon , and then got up hungry enough to make cotter fare quite palatable to the king . the more particularly as it was scant in quantity , and also in variety . it consisted solely of onions , salt , and the national [female] bread made out of horse feed . the woman told [female] about the affair of the evening before . at ten or eleven at night , when everybody was in bed .
[female] started , and they both turned round . dinah looked as if she did not see [female] . and fixed her eyes on [female] 's face . saying with calm kindness , i wo not say farewell . i shall see you again when you come from work .
ella oh , sir , you are indeed a true poet . for you touch our hearts , and they go out to you , gros . poor , poor girls , it is best to speak plainly , i know that i am loved by you . but i never can love you in return , for my heart is fixed elsewhere ! remember the fable of the magnet and the churn .
so , by great mischance , at this rushing and hurtling . he slew two knights and knew not that they were unarmed . and that they were of those he loved most , one was sir gareth . whom he had himself knighted , and the other was sir gaheris . in very truth sir [male] knew them not .
the sheet of water is healthy , it comes from heaven in the first place and next from the earth . the sheet of air is unhealthy , it comes from the sewer . all the miasms of the cess pool are mingled with the breath of the city . hence this bad breath , the air taken from above a dung heap . as has been scientifically proved , is purer than the air taken from above [location] .
his visit was not long , but before he went he fixed a scorpion in the heart of [female] . whose venom embittered every future hour of her life . we will now return for a moment to colonel crayton . he had been three months married , and in that little time had discovered that the conduct of his lady was not so prudent as it ought to have been . but remonstrance was vain ; her temper was violent ; and to the colonel 's great misfortune he had conceived a sincere affection for her .
but it was the cold that was most distressing , i felt that i could survive but a few minutes . people were struggling and floundering in the water about me . i could hear them crying out to one another , and i heard . also , the sound of oars , evidently the strange steamboat had lowered its boats . as the time went by i marvelled that i was still alive .
`` all right , honey , '' said the old man . and he cleared his throat as a signal for [female] . the little girl was pushing her bonnet back when [female] stepped into sight and . unstartled , unsmiling , unspeaking , she looked steadily at him -- one hand motionless for a moment on her bronze heap of hair and then slipping down past her cheek to clench the other tightly . [female] was bewildered , `` howdye , june ! ''
praise of their beauty , based upon comparisons . flatters the most sensitive self esteem , a movement of their eyebrows . the slightest play of the eye , the curling of the lip . instils a sort of terror in those whose lives and happiness depend upon their favor . a maiden inexperienced in love and easily moved by words may allow herself to be seduced .
they all agreed upon this plan , and started at once upon their way until they drew near the court where the queen and king were . there , too , was [male] the seneschal , and that disloyal man . full to overflowing of treachery , who has aroused the greatest anxiety for [male] on the part of the party which now arrives . they feel they have been discomfited and betrayed , and they make great lament in their misery . it is not a gracious message which reports this mourning to the queen .
then she too fell silent , perhaps it was the inevitable effect of life on the farm . or perhaps , as she sometimes said , it was because ethan `` never listened . '' the charge was not wholly unfounded , when she spoke it was only to complain . and to complain of things not in his power to remedy . and to check a tendency to impatient retort he had first formed the habit of not answering her .
she turned to her husband who was standing a little behind her . for the ceremonies in the cathedral had been twofold that day . and the archbishop who had placed the crown on the little head . had , in the little private chapel , placed a circlet of gold also on the queen 's finger . she had leant over and kissed him and armand had taken his hand and gripped it hard .
after a while , observing the absolute ingenuousness of the boy . thorpe used to take him from time to time on some of his daily trips to the pines . necessarily he explained partially his position and the need of secrecy . wallace was immensely excited and important at learning a secret of such moment . and deeply flattered at being entrusted with it , some may think that here , considering the magnitude of the interests involved .
next to [female] , and between him and briggs . was an empty chair : lady caroline 's , no more than lady caroline knew of the presence in [male] 's life of rose was rose aware of the presence in [male] 's life of lady caroline . what would each think ? he did not know ; he did not know anything . yes , he did know something , and that was that his wife had made it up with him . suddenly , miraculously , unaccountably , and divinely , beyond that he knew nothing , the situation was one with which he felt he could not cope .
that which had just taken place in this street would not have astonished a forest . the lofty trees , the copses , the heaths . the branches rudely interlaced , the tall grass , exist in a sombre manner . the savage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden apparitions of the invisible . that which is below man distinguishes , through the mists .
such is my argument in refutation , for where fear is absent love is not to be mentioned . whoever would love must needs feel fear , for otherwise he can not be in love . but let him fear only her whom he loves , and for her sake be brave against all others . then if he stands in awe of his lady love cliges is guilty of nothing wrong . even so , he would not have failed to speak straightway with her of love .
it will be remembered that when ayesha was standing on the spur . before we crossed to the stone , the wind tore her cloak from her . and whirled it away into the darkness of the gulf . we could not see whither , well -- i hardly like to tell the story . it is so strange , as we lay there upon the rocking stone .
sometimes a wheel was off the ground , it seemed . for many yards ; sometimes a stone was sent spinning over the hedge . and flinty sparks from the horse 's hoofs outshone the daylight . the aspect of the straight road enlarged with their advance . the two banks dividing like a splitting stick .
two strange travellers embellished one of his rooms , the innkeeper . hat in hand in the yard , swore to the courier that he was blighted . that he was desolated , that he was profoundly afflicted , that he was the most miserable and unfortunate of beasts . that he had the head of a wooden pig . he ought never to have made the concession , he said .
together with an intimation that , unable to wait for the slow delays of the post . he was going to follow her down to hollingford , and would arrive at the same time that she had done herself on the previous day . [female] said nothing about this letter to any one . she came late into the breakfast room , after mr. and mrs. [female] had finished the actual business of the meal . but her unpunctuality was quite accounted for by the fact that she had been travelling all the night before .
with these words he stretched forth his legs on a stool . and pointed the book of heathenish spells back upwards at the pilgrim . now this good pilgrim was plodding along , soberly and religiously , with a pound of flints in either boot . and not an ounce of meat inside him . he felt the spell of the wicked book .
she was precious but remote , because `` da '' was so near , and there is hardly room for more than one woman at a time in a man 's heart . with his father , too , of course , he had special bonds of union . for little jon also meant to be a painter when he grew up . with the one small difference , that his father painted pictures . and little jon intended to paint ceilings and walls .
he said but little as they rode onward and he listened . there was within him a certain distaste for what seemed to him the unnatural tumult of his feelings . a girl child of twelve rollicking in boys clothes was not a pleasing picture , but in one sense a tragic one . and certainly not such as should set a man 's heart beating and his cheek to flame when he heard stories of her fantastic life and character .
she was a thin , sallow , sickly , and nervous woman , with brilliant [female] eyes . she was fond of [female] . and her affection for her showed itself , as the affection of married women for girls always does . in the desire to make a match for [female] after her own ideal of married happiness . she wanted her to marry vronsky .
as they passed the table the orchids hanging over the edge caught on the trailing robe and started to fall . mrs. [female] paused to push them back , then studied the flowers an instant . and catching up the bunch carried it along , she closed the den door after her without a sound . and creeping beside the wall , hid behind the door curtain and peeped into the library . there were two men who evidently were a detective and a policeman , she saw lucette backed against the wall .
through these spectators the little procession , headed by the two brothers . moved slowly to the gate , mr [male] . yielding to the vast speculation how the poor creatures were to get on without him . was great , and sad , but not absorbed , he patted children on the head like sir [male] going to church . he spoke to people in the background by their [male] names .
chapter [female] , how sir [male] fought with the duke and his four sons and made them to yield them . then the giant fled and the knight after him . and so he drove him into a water . but the giant was so high that he might not [male] after him . and then sir [male] made the earl fergus man to [male] him stones .
and [male] locked his hand in hers and said . i once was looking for a magic weed , and found a fair young squire who sat alone . had carved himself a knightly shield of wood . and then was painting on it fancied arms , azure , an eagle rising or . the sun in dexter chief .
`` i am going to school , '' she said in her slow way . `` to learn to `` sight '' the desert of sahara , '' he looked at her . and his eyes gave her the homage he felt was her due . but he said nothing , here evidently was an indomitable spirit . but how did she get out into the wilderness ? where did she come from .
together he and [male] reached the pile . it only remained now to unhook the chain , in vain he tugged and hauled . the chain was buried deep beneath the stump and refused to move . and before he could swing his team about and turn the stump over . he heard [male] 's shout of victory .
the swallows having returned only a few days since , described their graceful curves between the heavens and the water . a breeze , laden with the perfumes of the blossoming woods . sighed along the road , and wrinkled the surface of the waters of the river . all these beauties of the day , all these perfumes of the plants . all these aspirations of the earth towards heaven .
but rumours are often false , and a lady may go to prague on a gentleman 's behalf without intending to marry him . all the women in [location] were at present more or less in love with the man who had been accused of murder . and the fantasy of madame goesler might be only as the fantasy of others . and then , rumour also said that [male] finn intended to marry lady [male] . at any rate a man can not have his head broken for asking a lady to marry him .
then came word to sir mordred that king [male] had raised the siege from sir [male] . and was coming homeward with a great host , to be avenged upon sir mordred . wherefore sir mordred made write writs to all the barony of this land . and much people drew to him , for then was the common voice among them . that with [male] was none other life but war and strife .
in the depth of his passion , he was sent for to the king . who with a look that threatened death entertained him . and demanded of him where his brother was , [male] made answer . that upon some riot made against the sheriff of the shire . he was fled from bordeaux , but he knew not whither .
neither mr. [male] nor mr. [male] was in a laughing humour . so the oddity of any of the speeches which the former made was unnoticed by them . mr. [male] whistled , without emitting any sound beyond a long hissing breath . changed his seat , without finding comfort or rest while mr. [male] sat immoveably still . his eyes fixed on one spot in the newspaper .
[male] did not understand , while there was nothing in his heart that could teach him . he had found her : he would keep her , the orphans home should not have her , the law should not have her . only one possibility had any weight with [male] . if some one like mr. [male] or miss winton wanted to give her a home of luxury .
thenardier , who was , above all , an astute and well balanced man . was a scamp of a temperate sort , this is the worst species . hypocrisy enters into it . it is not that thenardier was not , on occasion . capable of wrath to quite the same degree as his wife .
at first she heard only metivier 's voice , then her father 's . then both voices began speaking at the same time , the door was flung open . and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified metivier with his shock of [male] hair . and the prince in his dressing gown and fez . his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards .
here i am sorry to have to mention that beenie , returning , unsuccessful , from their first efforts . to the kitchen , to get hot water , and finding the dog sitting there motionless . with his face turned toward the door by which they had carried [male] out . peevish with disappointment and dread , drove him from the kitchen . and from the court , into the street where that same day he was seen wildly running with a pan at his tail .
i must really rest a little before i can get on any farther . when i have reclined for a few minutes , with my eyes closed . and when [female] has refreshed my poor aching temples with a little eau de cologne , i may be able to proceed , no . i am able to proceed , but not to sit up , i will recline and dictate . [male] has a horrid accent , but he knows the language .
there had been wonderful stars the evening before , and she had gone out into the top garden after dinner . leaving mrs. [female] alone over her nuts and wine . and , sitting on the wall at the place where the lilies crowded their ghost heads . she had looked out into the gulf of the night . and it had suddenly seemed as if her life had been a noise all about nothing .
the rich blood surged in waves over [female] 's face during this rude address . but she said not a single word in answer . after a little silence , she spoke in a voice that trembled with feeling . what a sweet , humble , even tearful , face it was ! and what a question to ask of ester , what had developed this disagreeable state of mind save the confused upbraidings of her hitherto quiet conscience over the contrast between [female] 's life and hers .
at the top end of the world a man becomes a multiple being . if he is white , two years along the rim of the arctic had taught [male] the science by which a man may become acquainted with himself . and in moments like the present , when both his mental and physical spirits overflowed . he even went so far as to attempt poor [male] 's [male] in the frenchman 's heavy basso , something between a dog 's sullen growl and the low rumble of distant thunder .
on the following evening news reached bullhampton that the grinder had been convicted and sentenced to death . but that [male] acorn had been acquitted , the judge , in his summing up . had shown that certain evidence which applied to the grinder had not applied to his comrade in the dock . and the jury had been willing to take any excuse for saving one man from the halter . fenwick and [male] breakfasted together on the morning that the former left [location] for bullhampton .
he could not deny this , and indeed was very reasonable throughout , his coming back was a venture . he said , and he had always known it to be a venture . he would do nothing to make it a desperate venture . and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help . i liked this scheme , and provis was quite elated by it .
nothing had happened to alarm [female] during my absence . she asked eagerly what success i had met with . when i told her she could not conceal her surprise at the indifference with which i spoke of the failure of my investigations thus far . the truth was , that the ill success of my inquiries had in no sense daunted me . i had pursued them as a matter of duty .
they were totally preoccupied , [male] was engrossed by the concerns of his theatre . and saw nothing that did not immediately relate to it , [male] , between his theatrical and his real part . between miss crawford 's claims and his own conduct . between love and consistency , was equally unobservant ; and mrs. [female] was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company . superintending their various dresses with economical expedient , for which nobody thanked her .
just a moment we gazed upon each other , and then the look of hope and renewed courage which had glorified her face as she discovered me . faded into one of utter dejection , mingled with loathing and contempt . i realized i had not answered her signal , and ignorant as i was of martian customs . i intuitively felt that she had made an appeal for succor and protection which my unfortunate ignorance had prevented me from answering . and then she was dragged out of my sight into the depths of the deserted edifice .
now the caïd had reached the gate , and was talking to the men in the motor car . would he send them away ? no , the gate was being opened by a servant . [male] must have invited the roumis in , possibly it was a wise thing to do . yet how dangerous , how terribly dangerous , with victoria perhaps peeping from one of the tiny windows at the women 's corner of the house . which looked on the court , they could not see her there , but she could see them .
the a. [male] u. had lost their master . one captain [male] was going , and the county had been driven to the necessity of advertising for a successor . `` when hunting comes to that , '' said lord [male] , `` one begins to think that it is in a bad way . '' it may always be observed that when hunting men speak seriously of their sport . they speak despondingly , everything is going wrong , perhaps the same thing may be remarked in other pursuits .
the range was measured off 100 and 250 yards for the rifle and 150 for the colt 45 . at this distance a bulls eye about the size of an apple was put up . each man was to have 14 shots at each range with the rifle and 12 shots with the colts 45 . i placed every one of my 14 shots with the rifle in the bulls eye with ease . all shots being made from the hip ; but with the 45 colts i missed it twice .
at the end of the first year he had asked [male] to marry him . and [male] had refused , jerome was disappointed , but he kept his head and went on courting [male] just the same . that is he went over to esek stockard 's house every saturday night and spent the evening . he walked home with [female] from prayer meeting and singing school and parties when she would let him . and asked her to go to all the concerts and socials and quilting frolics that came off .
a day or two after the servants all left i was again sent for to see sir [male] . the undeserved slur which he had cast on my management of the household did not . i am happy to say , prevent me from returning good for evil to the best of my ability . by complying with his request as readily and respectfully as ever , it cost me a struggle with that fallen nature . which we all share in common , before i could suppress my feelings .
there her voice faltered and failed , for all the bitterness of lost love . [female] , and happiness sounded in the pathetic passion of that exclamation . she did not weep , for tears seldom dimmed those tragical eyes of hers . but she wrung her hands in mute despair . and looked down into the frost blighted gardens below , as if she saw there a true symbol of her own ruined life .
but the white man saw him come , and even through the mask of his madness he knew nahoon again . and terror took hold of him . throwing away his empty rifle , for his ammunition was spent , he leaped upon his horse and drove his spurs into its flanks . away it went among the carnage , springing over the dead and bursting through the lines of shields . and after it came nahoon , running long and low with head stretched forward and trailing spear .
a grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is lady [female] 's point . she is always attended by a lover or two , and she keeps a little list of her lovers . and she is always booking a new lover , or striking out an old lover . or putting a lover in her [female] list . or promoting a lover to her blue list , or adding up her lovers .
the man gave the order back when he had read it . made a little gesture that resembled a bow , and led the way straight forward . `` i will be with you in a moment , [male] , '' said his voice ; and they heard his steps go on into the dark and cease . marjorie stood passive ; she could feel the girl 's hands clasp her arm .
`` i did not think he had so much spirit in him , '' was miss stanbury 's answer , throughout exeter the great wonder arising from the crisis was the amount of spirit which had been displayed by mr. [male] . when he was left alone he shook himself . and began to think that if there were danger that such interviews might occur frequently he had better leave exeter for good . as he put his hand over his forehead .
without knowing when the carriage turned into vicarage lane . or when it stopped , they found themselves . all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed. . emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night . the compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits .
of all their adventures together , however , those which occurred on their frequent excursions up to the valley of the giants impressed themselves imperishably upon bryce 's memory . how well he remembered their first trip , when , seated astride his father 's shoulders with his sturdy little legs around cardigan 's neck and his chubby little hands clasping the old man 's ears . they had gone up the abandoned skid road and into the semi darkness of the forest . terminating suddenly in a shower of [male] that fell in an open space where a boy could roll and play and never get dirty . also there were several dozen gray squirrels there waiting to climb on his shoulder and search his pockets for pine nuts .
there was not any condescension whatever in it . and yet it could not be called a vulgarly familiar manner : it was rather an astonishingly simple manner . somehow suggestive of a subtile recognition of [female] 's youth . and ill luck in not having before her more lively prospects , she gave [female] presents in the shape of articles of clothing at which slowbridge would have exclaimed in horror if the recipient had dared to wear them . but , when miss [female] expressed her regret at these indiscretions .
the moon , like a gardenia in the night 's button hole , but no ! why should a writer never be able to mention the moon without likening her to something else . usually something to which she bears not the faintest resemblance ? ... the moon , looking like nothing whatsoever but herself . was engaged in her old and futile endeavour to mark the hours correctly on the sun dial at the centre of the lawn .
i had indeed another bank bill about me of # 30 , which was the whole of what i brought with me , as well to subsist on in the country . as not knowing what might offer ; because this creature , the go between that had thus betrayed [male] both . had made me believe strange things of my marrying to my advantage in the country . and i was not willing to be without money , whatever might happen , this bill i concealed .
there could be no doubt of that ; and [female] was with difficulty rescued from the glad embraces of her new relatives . who , remembering all the young pair had suffered together , felt that this was the natural and happy ending of the long voyage so perilously begun . `` but why not tell us , and let [female] be ready for two brides instead of one ? '' asked mrs jo , looking as usual rather demoralizing in a wrapper and crimping pins . having rushed down from her chamber , where she was preparing for the labours of the evening .
mme , [female] remained standing . mute , motionless , and pale as a statue . the noise became louder ; the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant . if they were not yet to be seen , it was because the road made an elbow . the noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoofs .
meanwhile , from yonder deeps , from the great open sea , from the unapproachable latitudes . from the lurid horizon of the watery waste . from the utmost bounds of the free ocean , the winds pour down . the storm prepares mischief , in the old mythology these entities were recognised . indistinctly moving , in the grand scene of nature , eolus plotted with boreas .
the french evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh of october . kitchens and sheds were dismantled , carts loaded . and troops and baggage trains started . at seven in the morning a french convoy in marching trim . wearing shakos and carrying muskets , knapsacks , and enormous sacks .
mamua , when our laughter ends , and hearts and bodies . brown as white , are dust about the doors of friends , or scent ablowing down the night . then , oh , then , the wise agree , comes our immortality . mamua , there waits a land hard for [male] to understand . out of time , beyond the sun , all are one in paradise .
i took [female] into my confidence . to a certain degree , and we went to work privately , i told him that this was a sort of miracle that required a trifle of preparation . and that it would be sudden death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody . that made his mouth safe enough , clandestinely we made a few bushels of first rate blasting powder . and i superintended my armorers while they constructed a lightning rod and some wires .
the work done was exceptionally much for forty two men , they had cut the whole of the big meadow . which had , in the years of serf labor , taken thirty scythes two days to mow . only the corners remained to do , where the rows were short , but levin felt a longing to get as much mowing done that day as possible . and was vexed with the sun sinking so quickly in the sky . he felt no weariness ; all he wanted was to get his work done more and more quickly and as much done as possible .
chilcote moved nervously in his seat , it was the first real clash of personalities . he felt it -- recognized it by instinct . the sense of domination had fallen on him . he knew himself impotent in the other 's hands . whatever he might attempt in moments of solitude .
said mr. [male] , we acknowledge the quarrel . we acknowledge the walk home at night . we acknowledge the bludgeon , and we acknowledge a grey coat . but that happened towards the close of the second day , and they had not then reached the grey coat . the question of the grey coat was commenced on the third morning .
fancy was now kneeling beside the two inverted hives , one of which rested against her lap . for convenience in operating upon the contents . she thrust her sleeves above her elbows . and inserted her small pink hand edgewise between each white lobe of honeycomb . performing the act so adroitly and gently as not to unseal a single cell , then cracking the piece off at the crown of the hive by a slight backward and forward movement .
was it mrs. [female] ? could it be . any one else ? was it -- ? no , it might have been , years ago . but not now ; not now , -- and yet ; he was always so different from other people . and once , in church , he had handed her the hymn book with his finger pointing to a certain verse . she always fancied that her secret fidelity of heart rose from the fact that justin peabody was `` different . ''
the traitors in great dismay shout out . `` we are betrayed , betrayed , '' but the assailants take no heed of this . and let those whom they find unarmed feel the temper of their swords . indeed , three of those whom they found still armed were so roughly handled that but five remained alive . [male] rushed at calcedor , and in the sight of all struck him upon his golden shield with such violence that he stretched him dead upon the ground .
sometimes , he remained motionless by the half hour together in the shade of a leonidas or a spartacus . holding in his hand a book , above which his eyes . gently raised , sought the beautiful girl , and she , on her side . turned her charming profile towards him with a vague smile . while conversing in the most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white haired man .
this would naturally have been flattering to [male] had it not been that he was in truth absorbed by the story which he had heard . `` do you mean to tell me , '' he said . `` that broughton has -- committed suicide ? '' she could not speak of it again . but nodded her head at him thrice , while her eyes were still closed . `` and how was the manner of it ? '' said he .
catherine was with her friend again the next day . endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters . a needful exertion , for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near . [female] became more and more desponding , and before the letter arrived . had worked herself into a state of real distress .
like the eyes of a hunting ferret his own eyes swept quickly about the room . at the four windows there were long curtain cords . on the walls , hung there as trophies . were a number of weapons , on one end of kedsty 's desk . used as a paperweight , was a stone tomahawk .
mr [male] , who had merely put in his head and looked round the room without entering ( as if he were searching the house for that young lady with no nonsense about her ) . upon this followed up his head with his body , and stood before them . to whom , in a few easy words adapted to his capacity , mrs [female] stated the question at issue . the young gentleman , after anxiously feeling his shirt collar as if it were his pulse and he were hypochondriacal . observed , `` that he had heard it noticed by fellers . ''
but two considerations withheld him : [male] 's manners were a trifle too casual . at times they irritated [male] . and if he took the boy into his life as he hoped to . he would come into constant contact with leslie and her friends . who were cultured people of homing instincts , [female] 's manners must be polished .
on arriving there , he saw through the window a sergeant of police . and he entered , policemen recognize each other by the very way in which they open the door of a station house . javert mentioned his name , showed his card to the sergeant . and seated himself at the table of the post on which a candle was burning . on a table lay a pen , a leaden inkstand and paper .
in this way gabrielle became familiar with a number of dining rooms furnished in mahogany and horsehair and hung with opulent studies of still life in oils and engravings after mr. [male] . the meal was usually served by the whiskered coachman , who wore , for the occasion . a waistcoat decorated with dark blue and yellow stripes . and there was always cake for lunch , after the port . which generally made her feel sleepy , considine would be taken off to see the stables .
the day went by like a dream , [female] could never clearly recall it afterwards . it almost seemed as if it were not she who was teaching but somebody else . she heard classes and worked sums and set copies mechanically . the children behaved quite well ; only two cases of discipline occurred . morley [female] was caught driving a pair of trained crickets in the aisle .
he felt his limbs growing fuller and flexible with life . his body gained an unknown strength , he was a man again . strong and rounded , and he was a child , so soothed and restored and full of gratitude . and she , she was the great bath of life . he worshipped her , mother and substance of all life she was .
it is impossible for those who have not witnessed them to imagine those snowy avalanches which the sea thus precipitates . and under which it engulfs for the moment rocks of more than a hundred feet in height . such , for example , as the great anderlo at guernsey . and the pinnacle at [location] , at saint [male] of madagascar it passes completely over the promontory of tintingue . for some moments the sea drowned everything .
such an appearance it had on midsummer eve of this year . and as the hour grew later , and nine o'clock drew on , the irradiation of the daytime became broken up by weird shadows and ghostly nooks of indistinctness . imagination could trace upon the trunks and boughs strange faces and figures shaped by the dying lights . the surfaces of the holly leaves would here and there shine like peeping eyes . while such fragments of the sky as were visible between the trunks assumed the aspect of sheeted forms and cloven tongues .
after this night , [male] was a frequent visitor at the apartments of the austrian widow . for him , as for her , the fierce excitement of the gaming table was an irresistible temptation . in her elegantly appointed drawing rooms he met rich men who were desperate players . but he met few men who were likely to be dupes . here neither skill nor bribery availed him .
but not immediately : not until some kind of sign had passed between him and [male] . he could not be satisfied until she knew why , even if he were the man she would choose to marry . he would not marry her , hence he must keep his post and bear with mr. [male] a little longer . but he soon had reason to suspect that mr. [male] had anticipated him in the wish to break up their connection . deputations without and voices within had concurred in inducing that philanthropist to take a stronger measure than usual for the good of mankind .
loud laughter everywhere , and obscene songs , each one held his own course . carping and swearing , without listening to his neighbor , pots clinked . and quarrels sprang up at the shock of the pots . and the broken pots made rents in the rags . a big dog , seated on his tail , gazed at the fire .
the first year of [female] talboys widowhood passed away , the deep band of crepe about his hat grew brown and dusty . and as the last burning day of another august faded out , he sat smoking cigars in the quiet chambers of figtree court . much as he had done the year before , when the horror of his grief was new to him . and every object in life , however trifling or however important , seemed saturated with his one great sorrow .
here [female] brought to a close his long discourse and story . as full of misfortune as it was of love . but just as the curate was going to address some words of comfort to him . he was stopped by a voice that reached his ear . saying in melancholy tones what will be told in the fourth part of this narrative .
we had established the practice of barring all the gates and doors at nightfall . there was no way of guarding against an attack from the lake . whose frozen surface increased the danger from without ; but we counted on our night patrol to prevent a surprise from that quarter . i was well aware that i must prepare to resist the militant arm of the law . which pickering would no doubt invoke to aid him , but i intended to exhaust the possibilities in searching for the lost treasure before i yielded .
she heard the baize door close behind him . but the bell still continued to utter little pathetic notes , a moment after all was still in the corridor . and like one sunk to the knees in quicksands she felt that the time had come for a decided effort . but what could she do ? she could not follow him to the drawing room . she had begun to notice that he seemed to avoid her .
`` three burglaries , two forgeries , and a midnight assassination . '' yet in spite of having those weights on his conscience . [male] was somewhat enlivened by the late slight change in the circumstances of affairs . so were his two companions , its being a change was everything . the suspense seemed to have taken a new lease , and to have begun afresh from a recent date .
[male] , do not you dare to moralize to me . lackey , eh , do you think you have shown yourself finer than any maid servant tonight , [male] , why not ? although i must confess that the conquest was too easy to be exciting , [male] . and so i am ! for i can make you a countess and you could never make me a count , [male] . but i am born of a count , that you can never be , [male] . do not drink too much .
the crawfords , without wanting to be cured , were very willing to stay , [male] was satisfied with the parsonage as a present home . and [male] equally ready to lengthen his visit , he had come . intending to spend only a few days with them ; but mansfield promised well , and there was nothing to call him elsewhere . it delighted mrs. grant to keep them both with her . and [female] grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so .
dear [female] , it begins , -- i came last night to wuthering heights . and heard , for the first time , that [female] has been . and is yet , very ill , i must not write to her , i suppose . and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what i sent him . still , i must write to somebody , and the only choice left me is you .
grantaire , it will be remembered , had been asleep ever since the preceding evening in the upper room of the wine shop . seated on a chair and leaning on the table , he realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of `` dead drunk . '' the hideous potion of absinthe porter and alcohol had thrown him into a lethargy . his table being small , and not suitable for the barricade , he had been left in possession of it . he was still in the same posture , with his breast bent over the table .
naturally wondering what the letter might contain , i watched her countenance while she read it . and was somewhat surprised to see her bite her lip and knit her brows as if in anger . when she had done , she somewhat irreverently cast it on the table . saying with a scornful smile , — your grandpapa has been so kind as to write to me . he says he has no doubt i have long repented of my `` unfortunate marriage , ''
the lad from the posting house who came to groom the mare every morning passed through the passage with his heavy wooden shoes . there were holes in his blouse ; his feet were bare in list slippers . and this was the groom in knee britches with whom she had to be content ! his work done , he did not come back again all day . for [male] on his return put up his horse himself .
one day perceval was in the forest far up the mountain . and he looked over the blue distance far below across the moor . and saw a man riding on a wide road which he had never noticed before . and the man rode very fast , and as he went the sun seemed to flash from him as if he was clothed in glass . perceval wondered what he was , and resolved to go across the moor to the road he had seen .
alice sat silent , not knowing what to say in answer to this charge brought against her . thinking , perhaps , that the questioner would allow his question to pass without an answer . but vavasor was not so complaisant , `` if there be any reason , [female] , i think that i have a right to ask it . '' for a few seconds she did not speak a word . but sat considering , he also remained silent with his eyes fixed upon her .
[female] , you are vulgar ! said lady [female] , with cold indignation , and an expression of unfeigned disgust . she was , indeed , genuinely shocked , that a young lady of [female] 's birth and position should talk like this . actually objecting to a man as her husband because she recoiled from his wickedness . of which she was not to be supposed to know , or to be capable of understanding .
[female] hung up the receiver , poor amedee 's illness had taken on a new meaning to her . now that she knew emil had been with him . and it might so easily have been the other way -- emil who was ill and amedee who was sad ! [female] looked about the dusky sitting room , she had seldom felt so utterly lonely . if emil was asleep , there was not even a chance of his coming ; and she could not go to alexandra for sympathy .
maud and mr. [male] were coming up the slope . i beckoned them to come softly , not to disturb the father . they and i sat in silence , facing the west . the sun journeyed down to his setting -- lower -- lower ; there was a crescent . a line , a dim sparkle of light .
but yesterday the housemaid had told her that that little thing in the cradle had had two wet nurses before esther . and that both babies had died , it was then a life for a life . it was more , the children of two poor girls had been sacrificed so that this rich woman 's child might be saved . even that was not enough , the life of her beautiful boy was called for . then other memories swept into esther 's frenzied brain .
sir [male] , it has been represented to me that you are appalled by my exalted rank . i desire to convey to you officially my assurance . that if your hesitation is attributable to that circumstance , it is uncalled for , [male] , oh ! then your lordship is of opinion that married happiness is not inconsistent with discrepancy in rank , sir [male] . i am officially of that opinion , [male] , that the high and the lowly may be truly happy together .
well , we came to the place in five days ', sailing . i think they call it [female] 's point . and behold , when we came thither , the ship bound to [location] was loaded and gone away but three days before . this was a disappointment ; but , however , i , that was to be discouraged with nothing . told my husband that since we could not get passage to caroline .
connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in marriage improper to discuss before the ladies . pestsov had several times during dinner touched upon these questions . but sergey ivanovitch and stepan arkadyevitch carefully drew him off them . when they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out . pestsov did not follow them , but addressing [male] , began to expound the chief ground of inequality .
in the sea of moonlit brightness this strip of trees afforded a margin of soft . almost sooty obscurity , save where here and there darts of light fell through the raggedness of the foliage . finally he saw her , she was seated on a rounded bowlder and both her hands were pressed tightly against her face . her pose was rigid and unmoving ; an attitude of distress and high keyed misery of spirit . there was a droop of surrender in her usually gallant shoulders and a limpness in her whole body which even the darkness did not entirely conceal .
slowly up the hill i walked , occasionally pausing to place a forget me not on the grave of one i had known in childhood . even old barrows did not escape my passing tribute -- a cynical , cross grained old fellow . the aversion of the boys , who tormented him and whom he tormented with reciprocal vigor . no need of a forget me not for barrows . for he never forgot anything , so i gave his somewhat neglected grave the token of a long stem of little lilies .
at that moment , the sun rose , and there was already on the place a fairly numerous assembly of people who looked on from a distance at what was being thus dragged along the pavement to the gibbet . for that was provost tristan 's way at executions . he had a passion for preventing the approach of the curious . there was no one at the windows , only at a distance . at the summit of that one of the towers of [organization] which commands the grève .
his conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it . the bishop and [male] , nothing less than the first was required to soften the second . by one of those singular effects , which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies . in proportion as his revery continued , as the bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes . so did [male] grow less and vanish .
he begged for the privilege of `` helping choose , '' not because he did not trust her taste , but because he feared she might be economical . and during the whole day in bond street . regent street , oxford street , and knightsbridge she was given only an hour to herself . that hour she was expected to pass , and did pass .
the walls of these rooms were decorated not inartistically with a few colored prints and with cuts from illustrated papers . many and divers , the furniture throughout was home-made , with the single exception of a cabinet organ which stood in one corner of the reading room . on the windows of the dining room and bunk room were green roller blinds . but those of the reading room were draped with curtains of flowered muslin . indeed the reading room was distinguished from the others by a more artistic and elaborate decoration .
the melodeon gave the tune , and [male] and he stood to sing . taking the book between them , his hand touched hers . and as the music of the hymn rose and fell , the future unrolled itself before his eyes . a future in which [male] was his wedded wife . and the happy years stretched on and on in front of them until there was a row of little heads in the old peabody pew .
he crossed [male] 's inn with the same slow . almost listless step ; then , as his own doorway came into view , he stopped . some one was standing in its recess , for a moment he wondered if his fancy were playing him a trick . then his reason sprang to certainty with so fierce a leap that for an instant his mind recoiled . for we more often stand aghast at the strength of our own feelings than before the enormity of our neighbor 's actions .
they were each and all supposed to have been reared in utter unconsciousness of vice . the precautions used to keep them ignorant , if not innocent , were innumerable , how was it . then , that scarcely one of those girls having attained the age of fourteen could look a man in the face with modesty and propriety ? an air of bold , impudent flirtation . or a loose , silly leer , was sure to answer the most ordinary glance from a masculine eye .
marguerite did not trust her ears , half raising herself on her hands . she strained every sense to see or hear , to know the meaning of this very earthly sound . all was still again for the space of a few seconds ; the same silence once more fell upon the great and lonely vastness . then marguerite , who had listened as in a trance , who felt she must be dreaming with that cool . magnetic moonlight overhead , heard again ; and this time her heart stood still .
and yet , with all its pomp and magnificence , the service does not help me quite so much nor stir up the deep places . in me so quickly as dear old [male] 's simpler prayers and talks in the village meeting house where i went as a child . mr. [male] has seen it often . and made a little picture of it for me . with its white steeple and the elm tree branches hanging over it .
on her uncle 's return , she would hear some word about him . and so she sat alone , with a book before her , of which she could not read a line . she expected them about eleven , and was , therefore , rather surprised when the fly stopped at the door before nine . she immediately heard her uncle 's voice . loud and angry , calling for [male] , both [male] and bridget were unfortunately out .
as the duke ceased , there came from his hearers a sound like the rustling of leaves . in return for it , [male] performed that graceful act of subsidence to the verge of collapse which is usually kept for the delectation of some royal person . and indeed , in the presence of this doomed congress , she did experience humility . for she was not altogether without imagination , but , as she arose from her [female] , she was her own bold self again .
on the monday morning at a quarter before nine , [male] went to the counting house to report himself . to look about him , too , i suppose , -- and i bore him company . he was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to hammersmith . and i was to wait about for him , it appeared to me that the eggs from which young insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat . like the eggs of ostriches , judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a monday morning .
mr. [male] had his reasons for interrogating this poor woman . but he did not for a while let any one know what those reasons were . he could not , however , obtain more information than what is contained in the answers above given . which were , for the most part , true , neither the mother nor the younger woman knew where was to be found . at the present moment , that hero of adventure who was called the grinder .
when men of the same age , disposition and talents . fond of the same diversions and with the same degree of education . sit together in company with public women , or in an assembly of citizens . or at the abode of one among themselves , and engage in agreeable discourse with each other . such is called a sitting in company or a social gathering .
desiree eat like a raven , gambolled day and night in her bed . pitched tents with the sheets and blankets . lounged like a turk amidst pillows and bolsters . diverted herself with throwing her shoes at her bonne and grimacing at her sisters . over flowed , in short , with unmerited health and evil spirits ; only languishing when her mamma and the physician paid their diurnal visit .
that i ought to get money , or if not money , family connexion . i am very fond of money . as is everybody , only people are such liars . but then i like it to be my own ; and as to what people call connexion . i have no words to tell you how i despise it .
i have just received your letter , and am indeed sorry that its contents should be so little favourable to my hopes . i understand that your objection to me is simply in regard to the smallness and insecurity of my income . on the first point i may say that i have fair hopes that it may be at once increased . as to the second , i believe i may assert that it is as sure at least as the income of other professional men . such as barristers , merchants , and doctors .
for the two fosters were punctiliously anxious to make their shopmen test all their statements . insisting on an examination of the stock , as if hepburn and coulson were strangers to the shop . having the monkshaven auctioneer in to appraise the fixtures and necessary furniture . going over the shop books for the last twenty years with their successors . an employment which took up evening after evening ; and not unfrequently taking one of the young men on the long commercial journeys which were tediously made in a gig .
[male] , piano tuner , standard street , soho . [male] , [location] , green street , soho . [male] , frith street , soho ; [male] . 44 , tailor , [male] ; [male] bartram . stationer , east street buildings .
emma remained in a state of vexation too . but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her 's . than in his , she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary 's wrong . as mr. [male] , he walked off in more complete self approbation than he left for her . she was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of [female] were very adequate restoratives .
it was at this moment that mr. [male] . one of the thriftiest souls who ever came out of sweden , perceived that the chance of a lifetime had arrived for adding substantially to his little savings . by profession he was one of those men who eke out a precarious livelihood by rowing dreamily about the waterfront in skiffs . he was doing so now : and , as he sat meditatively in his skiff . having done his best to give the liner a good send off by paddling round her in circles .
it was a sort of hand book for women with grievances . a sort of compendious theory and practice of feminine free morality . it made you laugh at its transparent simplicity . but that authorship was revealed to me much later , i did not of course ask [male] what work his wife was engaged on . but i marvelled to myself at her complete ignorance of the world , of her own sex and of the other kind of sinners .
they had come through the vestibule , and although this was lined with eager blacks waiting for the young man who had insulted them so flagrantly from the rostrum , andre louis body guard had prevented any of them from reaching him . emerging now into the open , under the great awning at the head of the carriere . erected to enable carriages to reach the door under cover . those in front of him dispersed a little , and there was a moment as he reached the limit of the awning when his front was entirely uncovered .
i really believe , if the assuming faith in the story of the mermaid had been made the condition of receiving the flying fish . job legh , sincere man as he was . would have pretended belief ; he was so much delighted at the idea of possessing this specimen . he won the sailor 's heart by getting up to shake both his hands in his vehement gratitude . puzzling poor old [female] , who yet smiled through her wonder ; for she understood the action to indicate some kindly feeling towards her nephew .
she did not cry out , but with parted lips and radiant . glowing face , fled to him and was clasped to his heart . she could feel its beating against her breast . and his silence spoke to her through his eyes , which saw not her face but her soul . his lips brought the roses to her cheeks as the sea breezes had done .
i do not think we were speaking at all , sir [male] could not have interrupted any two people who had less to say for themselves . we have tried two or three subjects already without success . and what we are to talk of next , i can not imagine , books ? oh no . i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . i am sorry you think so , but if that be the case .
after that there was another pause , and then the conference was ended by a request from the duke that mrs. finn would stay at matching for yet two days longer . at dinner they all met , -- the father . the three children , and mrs. finn . how far the young people among themselves had been able to throw off something of the gloom of death need not here be asked . but in the presence of their father they were sad and sombre .
i told him when i had arrived . and how miss havisham had wished me to come and see estella . to which he replied , `` ah , very fine young lady ! '' then he pushed miss havisham in her chair before him . with one of his large hands , and put the other in his trousers pocket as if the pocket were full of secrets .
that the woman was french seemed probable , volcanoes cast forth stones . and revolutions men , so families are removed to distant places . human beings come to pass their lives far from their native homes . groups of relatives and friends disperse and decay . strange people fall , as it were , from the clouds .
no , she was not , not very , she had not walked all the way . she came by train as far as whitechapel station and had only walked from there . she had had an ugly pilgrimage ; but whether of love or of necessity who could tell ? and that precisely was what i should have liked to get at , this was not however a question to be asked point blank . and i could not think of any effective circumlocution , it occurred to me too that she might conceivably know nothing of it herself .
and so -- lanyard swore grimly . even so would he strike , now that it was his turn . now that his hour dawned , but he would have given much for a clue to the riddle . why must he be saddled with this necessity of striking in self defence ? why had this feud been forced upon him , who asked nothing better than to be let alone ?
my lady stopped upon the summit of this hill to draw breath and to clasp her hands upon her heart . in the vain hope that she might still its cruel beating . they were now within three quarters of a mile of the court . and they had been walking for nearly an hour since they had left the castle inn . lady audley stopped to rest , with her face still turned toward the place of her destination .
the island , which they reached in a few moments more . was circular in shape , and about fifty feet in diameter . it had a beach entirely around it . a hill perhaps ten feet high rose near its center . and at one end it was heavily wooded , there were no houses to be seen .
it is to be doubted whether the pride of the underhills would have permitted derek to reply in the affirmative . even if [male] had phrased his question differently ; but the brutal directness of the query made such a course impossible for him . nothing was dearer to derek than his self esteem , and , even at the expense of the truth . he was resolved to shield it from injury . to face [female] and confess that any girl in the world had given him .
and i will wager in their joy they kissed each other 's cheek . and they blessed their lucky stars we were hardy british tars who had pity on a poor parley voo . d 'ye see ? who had pity on a poor parley voo ! if you wish in the world to advance , your merits you are bound to enhance . you must stir it and stump it .
they were things i had meant very much to talk to you about . so that i went home vexed and disappointed , and only relieved myself a little by writing a few verses . i wonder if you will mind very much when i tell you they were suggested by you . you must forgive the poet 's license i take . here is one verse , the metrical irregularity is intentional , because i want .
to the man then of a silence made only more impressive by the inarticulate thunders and mutters of the great seas . an utter stranger to the clatter of tongues . there comes the muscular little fyne , the most marked representative of that mankind whose voice is so strange to him . the husband of his sister , a personality standing out from the misty and remote multitude . he comes and throws at him more talk than he had ever heard boomed out in an hour .
he was in the condition in which he had that morning set sail from the rocks . in rags , his bare elbows showing through his sleeves . his beard long , his hair rough and wild . his eyes bloodshot , his skin peeling . his hands covered with wounds ; his feet naked .
the game fluctuated , now in favour of one , now in favour of the other . without any great advantage on the side of either , nearly twenty minutes were passed thus . the light of the candle had by this time attracted heath flies . moths , and other winged creatures of night . which floated round the lantern , flew into the flame , or beat about the faces of the two players .
box five is just like all the other grand tier boxes , there is nothing to distinguish it from any of the others . [female] and [female] , ostensibly highly amused and laughing at each other , moved the furniture of the box . lifted the cloths and the chairs and particularly examined the arm chair in which `` the man 's voice '' used to sit , but they saw that it was a respectable arm chair . with no magic about it , altogether , the box was the most ordinary box in the world .
mademoiselle loire went at once to get her rent . which , she explained , always took her some time . `` for the people were not good at paying , '' and left the girls to look at the church . which was a very old one , after they were joined by mademoiselle they strolled along to [male] 's relations . the husband was a seller of cider .
over the door there was a board nailed flat against the wall . upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his back . the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general , with large silver stars . red spots represented blood ; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke . and probably represented a battle , below ran this inscription : at the sign of sergeant of waterloo .
in our love of books , of digging deep into certain subjects . of historic questing and speculative discussions we are closely sympathetic . but in many viewpoints we are as apart as the poles . perhaps we will always be , [male] by heritage and training and natural inclination is conventional and conservative . i am not , to walk in beaten tracks is not easy for me .
i do not want to , and she smiled strangely , with an infinite gentleness . she had never doubted that i had left her the day before in horror . how could she , since i had not come back before night to contradict . even as a simple form , such an idea ? and now she had the force of soul . miss tita with force of soul was a new conception .
when they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage . and making an effort to master himself , took leave of her with his usual urbanity . and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing . he said that tomorrow he would let her know his decision . his wife 's words , confirming his worst suspicions .
i welcomed the diversion of a turn in the fresher aid of the lobby . as we passed up the aisle i felt a sudden tug . then an ominous ripping , the floating chiffon overdrapery of my gown had caught in a seat . as dicky bent to release me his face showed consternation . almost a length of the dainty fabric trailed on the floor .
her dinner party was rather a large one , its honor guest an english writer whose books are unendurably dull . but any sort of lion is helpful in reducing social obligations . and for that purpose [male] had captured him . she insisted on my coming , but begged me not to mention horrid things . like poor people and politics and babies who died from lack of intelligent care .
as to [female] , who as yet knew nobody in the capital . he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province . and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the guards . he took his army to the priest 's . where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months .
it seemed as if the air of the high valley had got into his head . creature comforts were not forgotten , the two ladies amused themselves with experiments in cookery . the herders brought a basket of wild raspberries . and clover turned them into jam for winter use . [male] gloated over the little white pots , and was never tired of counting them .
`` good night , and our lady 's benison , '' said the palmer , with composure ; and his guide moved forward . a short passage , and an ascent of seven steps . each of which was composed of a solid beam of oak , led him to the apartment of the lady rowena . the rude magnificence of which corresponded to the respect which was paid to her by the lord of the mansion .
they were both addicted to hunting , neither of them did anything useful . in that respect mr. [male] stood the higher , as he managed his own property successfully . but [male] so wore his clothes , and so carried his limbs . and so pronounced his words that he was to be regarded as one entitled to make love to any lady . whereas poor mr. [female] was not justified in proposing to marry any woman much more gifted than his own housemaid .
she could have entered into competition with the two other little ones . so far as the coquetry of her dress was concerned ; she wore a cap of fine linen . ribbons on her bodice , and valenciennes lace on her cap . the folds of her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white . firm , and dimpled leg , she was admirably [female] and healthy .
he cried a little when his nurse finally tore herself away and left him with us . never shall i forget the scene , there he stood , with the sunlight from the window playing upon his golden curls . his fist screwed over one eye , whilst he took [male] in with the other . i was seated in a chair , and stretched out my hand to him to induce him to come to me . while job , in the corner , was making a sort of clucking noise .
from the moment when the archdeacon caught sight of this stranger . his attention seemed divided between him and the dancer . and his face became more and more gloomy , all at once he rose upright . and a quiver ran through his whole body : `` who is that man ? '' he muttered between his teeth : `` i have always seen her alone before ! ''
`` there will be no wedding tomorrow , '' fell from her lips in self communing murmur . but what a [female] , years could have made no greater change in her . she looked and she moved like one who is done with life . yet fears the few remaining moments left her , instinctively we fell back before her . instinctively we followed her with our eyes as .
had armed themselves from the pile of old iron . one with a heavy pair of shears , the second with weighing tongs . the third with a hammer , and had placed themselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable . the old man had remained on the bed , and had merely opened his eyes . the jondrette woman had seated herself beside him .
then came the sermon , preached very often before , lasting exactly half an hour , and then mr. [male] 's work was done . itinerant clergymen , who preach now here and now there , as it had been the lot of mr. [male] to do . have at any rate this relief , -- that they can preach their sermons often . from the communion table mr. [male] had stated that , in the present peculiar circumstances of the parish . there would be no second service at hogglestock for the present ; and this was all he said or did peculiar to the occasion .
but he did not shout it again , for he knew that she was dead . she was gone from him forever , yet he did not cease to search . the last of the sun went out , twilight came , and then darkness . even in that darkness he continued to search for a mile below the chute . calling her name more loudly now , and listening always for the answer which he knew would never come .
[female] 's first impulse was to stride briskly up to the intruder . tap him on the shoulder , and ask him what the devil he wanted . but a second look showed him that the other was built on too ample a scale to make this advisable . he was a large , fit looking intruder , mr pickering was alarmed . there had been the usual epidemic of burglaries that season .
he , in the hall , paced up and down ; he paused as i passed by . his forehead stern relaxed its frown : he raised his deep set eye . `` not quite so pale , '' he murmured low , `` now [male] , go rest awhile . '' and as i smiled , his smoothened brow returned as glad a smile . my perfect health restored , he took his mien austere again .
mr. [male] was apprised of [male] 's return by a letter . in which he was also informed that the wedding would take place in [male] church on the morning of the 22d . not long after there came invitations for himself , wife and [male] to attend the bridal party . at the residence of judge [male] . on the evening of july 25 , [male] , who was also invited .
down at our end there were but two tents ; one for me . and another for my servants , at the appointed hour the king made a sign . and the heralds , in their tabards , appeared and made proclamation . naming the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel . there was a pause , then a ringing bugle blast , which was the signal for [male] to come forth .
then sprang the happier day from underground ; and lady lyonors and her house . with dance and revel and song . made [female] over death , as being after all their foolish fears and horrors only proven a blooming boy . so large mirth lived and gareth won the [male] , and he that told the tale in older times says that sir gareth wedded lyonors . but he , that told it later , says lynette .
when she told herself that she would have no scope for action in that life in cambridgeshire which mr grey was preparing for her . she did not herself know what she meant by action . had any one accused her of being afraid to separate herself from [location] society . she would have declared that she went very little into society and disliked that little . had it been whispered to her that she loved the neighbourhood of the shops .
seen thus from above , the whole landscape looked immovable as a picture ; the anchored ships were massed in one corner . the river curved round the foot of [location] . and the isles , oblique in shape . lay on the water , like large , motionless , [male] fishes . the factory chimneys belched forth immense brown fumes that were blown away at the top .
all went smoothly ; and the capricious marquise , after tormenting the devoted baron to her heart 's content . owned herself conquered in the war of wits . and was just offering the hand he had fairly won , when a crash startled them . and a heavily decorated side scene swayed forward , ready to fall upon [female] , demi saw it and sprung before her to catch and hold it up . standing like a modern samson with the wall of a house on his back .
these were the only recollections -- all of them uncertain , and some of them contradictory . which could be extracted from lady [female] by careful questioning on the journey to [location] . miss [female] abstained from pressing her with any inquiries relating to events in the asylum . her mind being but too evidently unfit to bear the trial of reverting to them . it was known , by the voluntary admission of the owner of the mad house .
he was burning to do something besides helping mother in the kitchen . something which would save them and pull the tea room out of the hole . without a word to mother he started for [organization] . the estate of mrs. [female] . he did not know what he was going to do , but he was certain that he was going to do something .
four days of heat , wind , and sun without a drop of rain , had passed . the stalks were bending , the buds drooping . the leaves falling ; all this needed water , the rhododendron was particularly sad . father mabeuf was one of those persons for whom plants have souls . the old man had toiled all day over his indigo plot .
half of that last night he sat up . awake , or smoked in the glow of his fire , waiting for the dawn . with the first lifting of darkness he was traveling swiftly ahead of [male] and the morning was only half gone when he saw far ahead of him the great ridge which shut out indian [male] 's swamp . and nada 's plain , and [organization] ridge beyond it . it was noon when he stood at the crest of this .
`` i will come again at that time , '' replied the visitor . who then retired , at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage . which , instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue ferou . drove up to the green door , he knocked , and it opened immediately to admit him . from the signs of respect the valet paid him .
other creatures were at work in his brain now . they were building up and putting together the loose ends of things . carrigan became one of them , working so hard that frequently a pair of dark eyes came out of the dawning of things to stop him . and quieting hands and a voice soothed him to rest . the hands and the voice became very intimate , he missed them when they were not near .
`` here he is , here he is , '' cried a voice from the landing . `` here he is , i see him , '' the brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole . and had discovered [male] in a posture of entreaty . a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock . two more forced out the bolts , and the broken door fell in , [male] ran to the other door .
the rector patted her shoulder and smiled as at a bit of innocent naughtiness . and his wife took his behavior as an indication that she was not to be displeased . as for [female] , she kissed [female] and said . `` i do hope you will be happy , '' but then sank into the background and tried to keep the tears back too , in the late days she had been imagining a little romance about [male] .
it would be too crude to say that his wife had made him pay for her public concession by the private disregard of his wishes . and if something of this sort had actually resulted , his sense of fairness told him that it was merely the natural reaction of a soft nature against the momentary strain of self denial . at first he had been hardly aware of this consequence of his triumph . the joy of being able to work his will at westmore obscured all lesser emotions . and his sentiment for [male] had long since shrunk into one of those shallow pools of feeling which a sudden tide might fill .
it was quite shady under the tree ; the sun could not get at him . only make the rest of the world bright so that he could see the grand stand at epsom away out there . very far , and the cows cropping the clover in the field and swishing at the flies with their tails . he smelled the scent of limes , and lavender , ah ! that was why there was such a racket of bees , they were excited .
now there existed in littlebath at this time a weekly periodical called the [male] examiner . with which mr maguire had for some time had dealings . he had written for the paper , taking an earnest part in local religious subjects . and the paper , in return , had very frequently spoken highly of mr maguire 's eloquence . and of mr maguire 's energy .
[male] was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him . and on that he rested for the residue of their income . but [male] had no such dependence ; for since [female] would still be unable to marry miss [female] . and his chusing herself had been spoken of in mrs. ferrars 's flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing [female] steele . she feared that [female] 's offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich [male] .
on revisiting my drawers , i found them all securely locked . the closest subsequent examination could not discover change or apparent disturbance in the position of one object . my few dresses were folded as i had left them . a certain little bunch of white violets that had once been silently presented to me by a stranger ( a stranger to me . for we had never exchanged words ) , and which i had dried and kept for its sweet perfume between the folds of my best dress .
marguerite 's face had quickly lost its look of joy . the terrible danger in which [male] stood , now that he was actually on french soil . became suddenly and horribly clear to her , [organization] was close upon his heels ; here in [male] . the astute diplomatist was all powerful ; a word from him and [male] could be tracked and arrested and . every drop of blood seemed to freeze in her veins .
such was [female] morland at ten . at fifteen , appearances were mending ; she began to curl her hair and long for balls . her complexion improved , her features were softened by plumpness and colour . her eyes gained more animation , and her figure more consequence . her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery .
the woman with whom he was now lodging , and whose resources were infinitely benefited by his payments to her . had already thrown out hints that she was afraid of him . and as he looked at his wife , he knew that he loved her . everything for him now was hot and dry and poor and bitter , how sweet would it be again to sit with her soft hand in his . to feel her cool brow against his own , to have the comfort of her care .
[female] , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation . and when at length they turned in at the lodge . her spirits were in a high flutter , the park was very large . and contained great variety of ground , they entered it in one of its lowest points . and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent .
indeed , he was so little impressed by my presence there that he was for passing me without a word or any other hint of good fellowship . save the bow of which i have spoken , but this did not suit me . i was hungry , cold , and eager for creature comforts . and the house before me gave forth not only heat . but a savory odor which in itself was an invitation hard to ignore .
for the first few days , [female] , moved with undefined remorse . tried to take a part in nursing her , she took things from him . as she did from the landlady , without heed or recognition . just once , opening suddenly her eyes wide upon him , she uttered a feeble wail of `` baby ! '' and , turning her head , did not look at him again , then , first , [male] 's conscience gave him a sharp sting .
in other directions , the fields and sky were so much of one colour by the snow . that it was difficult in a hasty glance to tell whereabouts the horizon occurred . and in general there was here , too , that before mentioned preternatural inversion of light and shade which attends the prospect when the garish brightness commonly in the sky is found on the earth . and the shades of earth are in the sky . over the west hung the wasting moon .
i am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience . it was christmas week : we took to no settled employment . but spent it in a sort of [male] domestic dissipation . the air of the moors , the freedom of home . the dawn of prosperity , acted on [male] and [male] 's spirits like some life giving elixir .
it was hers , the hand of the woman who loved me . when all was lost , her love was not lost , she came after me . she took me with her . she set me free , when all [location] was already subdued . there was still one corner in our native land where the hand of authority never came .
an accepted lover , who deserves to have been accepted , should devote every hour at his command to his [male] . but mr. [male] had of late been so chary of his presence at heavitree . that [male] could not but have known that he took no delight in coming thither . she had acknowledged this to herself ; but she had consoled herself with the reflection that marriage would make this all right . mr. [male] was not the man to stray from his wife .
`` come along , quick , '' i said ; and they came , [male] led the way . thankful to show himself of use , [male] followed as if to protect or screen the girls from sight . i brought up the rear , and so , scuttling through a rabbit [male] of little unfurnished . dilapidated rooms , we found a narrow side staircase . and tumbled down it , anyhow , in dust and dimness .
it was thus agreed between them that the necessary information should be at once given to the squire . and that the old , well loved house should be left for ever , it would be a great fall in a worldly point of view . from the allington small house to an abode in some little street of guestwick . at allington they had been county people . raised to a level with their own squire and other squires by the circumstance of their residence .
all was forgotten in the happiness of the moment -- the long fight for his life . and the possibility that any moment might declare him to be mere food for powder and shot . she was only conscious that she had accomplished her woman 's work . she had brought him up to man 's estate . and that was her sufficient reward , what a fine fellow he was !
she flung open the outer chapel door , and ran along the path towardagatha 's . i watched her in the starlight until a bend in the path hid her swift moving figure . down through the passage i hastened , her lantern lighting my way . at the door of bewilderment i closed the opening . setting up the line of wall as we had left it in the afternoon .
i am the only one aft who possesses this information . and i confess i do not know what to do with it . i know that mr. [male] would tell me to mind my own business . mr. [male] is out of the question . and captain west has not any crew .
each district , under the new system , had its flag . its bottle of ink , its sheaf of documents tabulated and filed for reference in a drawer . so that by looking under m or s , as the case might be . you had all the facts with respect to the suffrage organizations of that county at your fingers ', ends . this would require a great deal of work , of course .
as she thus resolved , she was leaning over the gate looking into the churchyard . not much observing the graves or the monuments or the beautiful old ivy covered tower . or thinking of the dead that were lying there , or of the living who prayed there . but swearing to herself that for the rest of her life she would keep clear of . what she called , girlish messes , like other young ladies she had read much poetry and many novels .
there was no pain , as he had expected there would be , he felt like crying out in his joy . one after the other he stretched up his arms , he bent over until the tips of his fingers touched the floor . he crooked his knees , leaned from side to side . changed from one attitude to another , amazed at the strength and elasticity of his body . twenty times , before he returned to his bed .
emma had her dinner served in her bedroom on a tray by the fireside . she was a long time over it . everything was well with her , `` how good i was ! '' she said to herself , thinking of the scarves , she heard some steps on the stairs . it was leon , she got up and took from the chest of drawers the first pile of dusters to be hemmed .
the river lay ahead , and for him the river had become the soul and the promise of life . it was marette 's river and his river . and in a little while they would be on it , and marette would then tell him about kedsty . he was sure of that , she would tell him what had happened while he slept . his faith was illimitable , they came into the sodden dip at the foot of the ridge .
well , it stunned me so , when i first found it out . that i could not believe it ; it did not seem natural . but as soon as my mental sight cleared and i got a right focus on it . i saw i was mistaken ; it was natural , for this reason . a king is a mere artificiality , and so a king 's feelings .
before mrs. [organization] could pull herself together she heard his steps returning . she closed the door fearfully , he came along the passage and stopped for a moment just outside her room . there was nothing between them but an oak door . so thin , she felt , that he must surely hear her anxious breath . she dared not breathe , but in a moment he passed by .
it was difficult then , today it was impossible . he had before him that deaf and implacable house . six stories in height , which appeared to be inhabited only by a dead man leaning out of his window . he had on his right the rather low barricade . which shut off the rue [male] petite truanderie .
but the impulse had been given , the king of thunes had set the example . evidently , the bishop was defending himself , and they only battered the door with the more rage . in spite of the stones which cracked skulls right and left . it was remarkable that all these stones fell one by one ; but they followed each other closely . the thieves always felt two at a time , one on their legs and one on their heads .
thus she talked on -- sometimes in anger , sometimes apparently jesting -- till her servant came to let her know the dinner was served . upon entering the dining room , and seeing lord elmwood 's place at table vacant . she started back , she was disappointed of the pleasure she expected in dining with him . and his sudden absence , so immediately after the intelligence that she had received from miss [female] . increased her uneasiness , she drew her chair .
after a time there fell a silence upon those ahead , no sound rose above the steady dip of paddles . and the speed of the two canoes increased , suddenly , from far up the river . there came a voice , faintly at first , but growing steadily louder , singing one of the wild half breed songs of the forest . the voice broke the silence of those in the canoes . they ceased paddling , and [male] stopped .
bates was soberly chopping wood at a rough pile of timber at the rear of the house . his industry had already impressed me , he had the quiet ways of an ideal serving man . i turned next to the unfinished tower in the meadow . from which a windmill pumped water to the house . the iron frame was not wholly covered with stone .
paul found his valet [male] . taking what he called a snack , in the dining room . a cloth was spread upon the corner of the table . and there was a fore quarter of cold roast lamb , a bottle of french brandy . and a decanter half full of madeira before the valet .
i found the lamp and lighted it . carried it up to him , and stood before him . contemplating him curiously , he lay back in our one easy chair . his hands clasped behind his head , his legs outstretched . he had been idle for the first time , i think , since i had known him .
it seemed then to be your opinion , that the charm lay entirely in the art with which the unknown author had availed himself . like a second m'pherson , of the antiquarian stores which lay scattered around him . supplying his own indolence or poverty of invention . by the incidents which had actually taken place in his country at no distant period . by introducing real characters , and scarcely suppressing real names , it was not above sixty or seventy years .
the clerk , who listened with great curiosity , soon produced a foreign letter . with the address demanded , while eagerly advancing to receive it , she anxiously enquired . whether there were no inland letter with the same direction ? [male] then , clapping his hand upon the shoulder of the clerk . positively declared , that he would lodge an information against him .
the eventful thursday at length came , they were expected about dark . and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below . the kitchen was in perfect trim ; [male] and i were dressed . and all was in readiness , [male] arrived first , i had entreated him to keep quite clear of the house till everything was arranged . and , indeed , the bare idea of the commotion .
none of them feared him . the monotony of his occupation soothed him . and was in itself a pleasure , a forced limitation of effort offered a justification of homely courses to an unambitious man . whose conscience would hardly have allowed him to remain in such obscurity while his powers were unimpeded . hence yeobright sometimes sang to himself .
doctor , i am convinced that an act of violence has been committed . but the question now is whether that act of violence can be considered an outbreak of passion or madness , pastor . but apart from the actual outbreak , you must acknowledge that he has fixed ideas . ', doctor . i think that your ideas , pastor , are much more fixed , doctor . we will leave settled views out of this , madam , it rests with you to decide whether your husband is guilty to the extent of imprisonment and fine or should be put in an asylum !
if you could run your hand along [female] meredith 's jaw you would feel a lump . he admits he 's never been sure which fist left it there . but he would not lose it for anything . he says there 's no cad like an old cad . and that sometimes just before making a decision , it 's a great help to stroke his chin .
mr. [male] was the victim of marriage . destiny had ordained that he should spend his life in golf and gardening . or in breeding earless rabbits and stingless bees . he was bucolic and passive , mrs. [female] . however , after a slight altercation with destiny , had decided that mr. [female] was to become a rising politician .
her face was stained with tears , her thick . [female] lashes were still wet with them . but her expression , as her eyes met loder 's . was a strange example of the courage , the firmness . the power of sacrifice that may be hidden in a fragile vessel .
she was returning to her impatient , irritable life . she forgot how high the fever had been at night . and how the young head had ached ; and only remembered how thoroughly tired she was . watching and ministering day and night , so , when she followed [male] to the sitting room . in answer to his `` i want to see you , miss ester , ''
he demanded from her the writing of the letter almost immediately after the conversation which has been given above . and of course the letter was written , -- written and recopied , for the paragraph about the money was . of course , at last of his wording , and she could not make the remainder of the letter [female] . the feeling that she was making a demand for money on her father ran through it all . but the reader need only see the passage in which [male] lopez made his demand .
the advertisement had appeared for the sixth time , and [female] had framed a second . offering a reward of twenty pounds for any direct evidence of the marriage of [male] . when a letter was handed to him one evening at the post office . a letter in a common blue envelope . directed in a curious crabbed hand , and bearing the [location] post mark .
the idea instantly occurred to him that something was wrong . he softly tried the door , and found it locked . the robbers having no doubt taken that precaution . to prevent their being surprised at their thieving work by any person in the house . the one other way of getting into the room , was the way that we had tried .
[female] had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell 's house in september . it had not been necessary , and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade and escape from . her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the lodge . and to gladden the eyes of its [female] , there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell 's joy in meeting her . she knew who had been frequenting uppercross , but happily , either [female] was improved in plumpness and looks .
while he ruminated a footstep descended the stairs . it was the nurse , who brought in her hand a rolled mass of wet paper . the woman was so engrossed with her occupation that she hardly saw venn . she took from a cupboard some pieces of twine . which she strained across the fireplace , tying the end of each piece to the firedog .
left alone , darya alexandrovna , with a good housewife 's eye . scanned her room , all she had seen in entering the house and walking through it . and all she saw now in her room , gave her an impression of wealth and sumptuousness and of that modern european luxury of which she had only read in english novels . but had never seen in [location] and in the country , everything was new from the new french hangings on the walls to the carpet which covered the whole floor . the bed had a spring mattress .
he went no closer than the highway . because it was not necessary , he ordered the car to turn and go back . and for the first and only time he was filled with bitter resentment against [male] . [male] had fooled him , he sat beside the driver . his face glowering and his eyes hot .
the two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in greater awe of their father . who addressed them on the occasion with rather an injudicious particularity . but they were too much used to company and praise to have anything like natural shyness . and their confidence increasing from their [female] 's total want of it . they were soon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy indifference .
the existence of [female] was one which might well excite curiosity in the minds of the few neighbours who had the opportunity of observing her mode of life . this beautiful widow had no female acquaintances , save a humble friend who lived with her . an englishwoman , who subsisted upon the charity of the lovely [female] . this person never quitted her benefactress . she was constant as her shadow ; a faithful watch dog .
that week i could do little more than dream and dream and rove about . seeking by perpetual change to find the way back to myself . i cared not for the people round me , neither took delight in victuals . but made believe to eat and drink and blushed at any questions , and being called the master now . head farmer , and chief yeoman , it irked me much that any one should take advantage of me .
avondale road was an obscure corner of the suburb . obscure , for it had just sprung into existence . the scaffolding that had built it now littered an adjoining field . where in a few months it would rise about horsely gardens . whose red gables and tiled upper walls will correspond unfailingly with those of avondale road .
then he went on , he described hatchet river post . where the tragedy had happened ; then told of the fight that came about one day between [male] audemard and the factor of the post and his two sons . it was an unfair fight ; he conceded that . three to one was cowardly in a fight , but it could not excuse what happened afterward . audemard was beaten , he crept off into the forest , almost dead .
after deciding on my wife 's mission to [location] . i arranged that the journey should serve a double purpose , a nurse for the suffering [female] . equally devoted to the patient and to myself , was a necessity of my position . one of the most eminently confidential and capable women in existence was by good fortune at my disposal . i refer to that respectable matron , madame [female] .
at the end of an hour and a half the two ladies retired . and [female] disrobed herself , and miss van siever put on her customary raiment . it was agreed among them that they had commenced their work auspiciously . and that they would meet again on the following monday , the artist begged to be allowed an hour to go on with his work in mrs. [female] 's room . and the hour was conceded to him , it was understood that he could not take the canvas backwards and forwards with him to his own house .
we three shared the queen 's feelings . and forgetting the many chances of the chase , any one of which would amply account for the king 's delay . fell to speculating on remote possibilities of disaster , he might have met rischenheim . though they had ridden in opposite directions ; rupert might have intercepted him . though no means could have brought rupert to the forest so early .
yet again , they were flickering their way to the centre . finding the path blindly , enviously , and again , all was still , as birkin and ursula watched . the waters were loud on the shore , he saw the moon regathering itself insidiously . saw the heart of the rose intertwining vigorously and blindly , calling back the scattered fragments . winning home the fragments , in a pulse and in effort of return .
these ideas were in my mind , while on donkeys and in arabeahs we dashed as if our lives depended on speed . from the temple of karnak to the temple of luxor . along the dusty white road trimmed with sphinxes , this description was [female] biddell 's . she being happy and therefore frivolous , she rode with [female] . as queens may have ridden along that way , guarding a captive prince who had been subdued forever .
it was useless to hope for the doctor 's arrival . before another hour at least , i felt the necessity of getting back at once to the rectory . so as to be able to tell lucilla the melancholy truth , otherwise , the news of what had happened would get abroad in the village . and might come to her ears , in the worst possible way , through one of the servants . to my infinite relief , mr. [male] .
the dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable comfort to themselves . the house and the garden , with all the objects surrounding them . were now become familiar , and the ordinary pursuits which had given to norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than norland had been able to afford . since the loss of their father , sir [male] . who called on them every day for the first fortnight .
there was a delay which seemed to him interminable , then a hasty shuffling of slipshod feet upon the basement stairs . then the glimmer of a light through the keyhole . the removal of a chain , and at last the opening of the door . it was opened by a young person with her hair dressed in the prevailing fashion . and an air of some gentility , which clashed a little with a certain slatternliness that pervaded her attire .
rosamund stirred , slowly she took her elbows from the table . and folded her arms resting them upon the edge of it . thus leaning forward she listened now with an odd brightness in her eye . a slight flush in her cheeks reflecting some odd excitement called into life by lord [male] 's admission . an admission which sensibly whittled down the charges against the prisoner .
he would never more mention her name to any one . unless it were to lady [male] to night , to dalrymple he would not open his mouth about her . but would plainly ask his friend to be silent on that subject if her name should be mentioned by him . but morning and evening he would pray for her . and in his prayers he would always think of her as his wife .
it was thus that crofts first heard of their intention . now , in these days of [male] 's worst illness . he came daily over to allington , remaining there , on one occasion , the whole night . for all this he would take no fee ; -- nor had he ever taken a fee from mrs [female] . `` i wish you would not come so often , '' [organization] said to him one evening .
`` perhaps i shall go up to town , i do not quite know yet . '' georgie moved away irresolutely , there was a lecture at [organization] on the supply of ammunition in the field . and the one man whose theories most irritated [male] cottar would deliver it . a heated discussion was sure to follow , and perhaps he might find himself moved to speak . he took his rod that afternoon and went down to thrash it out among the trout .
by this time the horses were well breathed , and the leader holding up his sword and giving rein . the whole troop of chargers broke into the [organization] and thundered . with their double load of fighting men , down the remainder of the hill and across the snow-covered plain that still divided them from shoreby . the whole distance to be crossed was not above a quarter of a mile . but they had no sooner debauched beyond the cover of the trees than they were aware of people fleeing and screaming in the snowy meadows upon either hand .
we watched fixedly , a sudden bell rang in the house , the prayer bell . instantly into our alley there came , out of the berceau , an apparition . all [female] and white , with a sort of angry rush close , close past our faces . swept swiftly the very nun herself , never had i seen her so clearly , she looked tall of stature . and fierce of gesture , as she went .
retreating into the gloom of the broad landing she saw rise up the stairs a woman whom at first she did not recognize . till her voice revealed her to be [female] . in great fright and sorrow , a streak of light from the partially closed door of [female] 's room fell upon her face as she came forward . and it was drawn and pale , [female] sank down on the oak chest which stood on the landing . and put her hands to her now flushed face and head .
and [female] , drawing in the ladder , closed the window . [female] then looked around attentively , never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant . at each corner were arranged trophies , presenting to view swords of all sorts . and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the cardinal [female] lorraine . the cardinal [female] , the cardinal [male] valette .
sir [male] was told of all this on his return home . and he asked many questions as to the nature of stanbury 's work . when it was explained to him , -- lady rowley repeating as nearly as she could all that hugh had himself said about it . he expressed his opinion that writing for a penny newspaper was hardly more safe as a source of income than betting on horse races . `` i do not see that it is wrong , '' said mrs. trevelyan .
may gave him a glance of comprehension . and he saw her whisper to his mother . who nodded sympathetically ; then she murmured an excuse to mrs. [female] . and rose from her seat just as marguerite fell into [male] 's arms . archer , while he helped her on with her opera cloak .
auspiciously as the new life seemed to have begun , the closeness with which their expenses were matching their income was an ever present menace . bass , originally very generous in his propositions , soon announced that he felt four dollar a week for his room and board to be a sufficient contribution from himself . [male] gave everything she earned . and protested that she did not stand in need of anything . so long as the baby was properly taken care of , [female] secured a place as an overgrown cash boy .
it was impossible that she should not love him . was he not the brightest and the best of men that she had ever seen . or was like to see ? -- that she could possibly ever see , she would have said to herself . could she have brought herself to own the truth ? and then , when she heard how true he was , how he persisted against father .
i was inclined to pursue the enemy and try to capture more of them . but jeremy stickles would not allow it . for he said that all the advantage would be upon their side . if we went hurrying after them , with only the moon to guide us . and who could tell but what there might be another band of them , ready to fall upon the house .
as soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered into her presence . king uriens was there , a kind faced old man with a subdued look . and also the son , sir uwaine le blanchemains . in whom i was , of course , interested on account of the tradition that he had once done battle with thirty knights . and also on account of his trip with sir gawaine and sir marhaus .
he tried to drag his eyes from her face and hair . sensing that he was a near criminal , fighting a mighty impulse . the notes under her fingers changed , and again -- by chance or design . she was stabbing at him ; bringing him face to face with the weakness of his flesh . the iniquity of his desire to reach out his arms and crumple her in them .
three months afterwards , hearing that his vanquished foe had met with reverses . and was likely to be really distressed for want of employment , he forgot his hatred . and alike active in good and evil , he moved heaven and earth till he found her a place . upon her coming to make up former differences , and thank him for his recent kindness . the old voice -- a little loud -- the old manner .
the air was bad , and the crowds were great , it was coming on toward christmas time . and the store was crammed to bursting day after day and night after night . for they kept open evenings now until christmas . [female] longed for a breath from the mountains . and grew whiter and thinner , sometimes she felt as if she must break away from it all .
it was the night lady glencore received . and , as usual , the street was crowded with equipages , which somehow seemed to have got into inextricable confusion . some endeavoring to turn back , while others pressed forward , -- the court of the palace being closely packed with carriages which the thronged street held in fast blockade . as the apartments which faced the street were not ever used for these receptions . the dark unlighted windows suggested no remark .
when he went out of the door of mr. [male] 's study . he vanished from the house and from [location] . turning the first corner he came to , and the next and the next , he stepped into a mews . the court of which seemed empty , and slipped behind the gate , he wore a new hat . and was clean shaved except his upper lip , presently a man came out of the mews in a scotch cap and a full beard .
as the porter opened the gates of the avenue to the carriage that brought them . [female] felt an awful , and yet gladsome sensation . which no terms can describe , as she entered the door of the house this sensation increased . and as she passed along the spacious hall , the splendid staircase . and many stately apartments , wonder , with a crowd of the tenderest .
perhaps [female] did not wholly coincide with my argument , but she was called away to her sewing circle . while [female] and i lounged lazily on the porch , i continuing my reminiscences . garrulity is not merely the prerogative of age . the privilege of the monologue is always that of the old boy who comes back to his childhood 's home and finds in a pretty girl a charming and attentive listener . he is a poor orator , indeed , who can not improve such opportunities .
she did not dress young , or live much with young people , or correspond with other girls by means of crossed letters . nor expect that , for her , young pleasures should be provided , life had always been serious with her . but now , we may say , since the terrible tragedy in the family . it must be solemn as well as serious , the memory of her brother must always be upon her . and the memory also of the fact that her father was now an impoverished man .
and the steam thing came , and cows grazed where moose had fed . and bread was gathered close to the edge of the great swamps . thus did civilization break into athabasca landing . in this distance of the long water trail one sees and hears many things . it is life , it is adventure .
`` what the deuce are you afraid of ? '' said [female] . they had then come up the greater part of the length of the birdcage walk . and the lights at storey 's gate were just visible . but the road on which they were then walking was very dark , the trees were [male] over their head . and not a step was heard near them , at this time it was just midnight .
at first , man was enslaved by the gods , but he broke their chains . then he was enslaved by the kings , but he broke their chains . he was enslaved by his birth , by his kin . by his race , but he broke their chains . he declared to all his brothers that a man has rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take away from him .
but in the feeble condition i was now in , and without any provisions . to escape from the neighbourhood of parahuari was impossible , seeing that it was necessary at starting to avoid the villages where the indians were of the same tribe as runi . who would recognize me as the white man who was once his guest and afterwards his implacable enemy . i must wait , and in spite of a weakened body and a mind diseased . struggle still to wrest a scanty subsistence from wild nature .
who blames me ? many , no doubt ; and i shall be called discontented . i could not help it : the restlessness was in my nature . it agitated me to pain sometimes , then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey . backwards and forwards , safe in the silence and solitude of the spot . and allow my mind 's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it .
he was disconcerted and suspicious , but when i explained that i had seen a smoke while on the hills . where i had gone to search for a curious blue flower which grew in such places . and had made my way to it to discover the cause . he recovered confidence and invited me to join him at his dinner of roast meat . i was hungry by this time and not sorry to get animal food once more .
but when we reached him , and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from his own door . we found he had no horse . and we were forced to dismount , and leave ours to graze , he lay on the heath . awaiting our approach , and did not rise till we came within a few yards . then he walked so feebly , and looked so pale , that i immediately exclaimed .
taterleg stood looking after the two riders , the hindmost drawing steadily upon the leader . and stood looking so until they disappeared in the timber at the base of the hills . it was dusk when [male] came back . leading [male] 's horse , there was blood on the empty saddle . the events of that sunday introduced [male] into the bad lands and established his name and fame .
but then he might distinguish himself in parliament . there was something in that ; and lady gwendoline brought all her power to bear upon the young man 's career . she fanned tha faint flames of his languid ambition with her own fiery breath . this girl , with her proud saxon beauty , her cold blue eyes . her pale auburn hair , was as ardent and energetic as joan of arc or [female] of england .
[female] smiled , she had learned to discount largely miss [female] 's opinions of the four winds men . otherwise she must have believed them the most hopeless assortment of reprobates and ne'er do wells in the world . with veritable slaves and martyrs for wives . this particular [female] , for example , she knew to be a kind husband . a much loved father , and an excellent neighbor , if he were rather inclined to be lazy .
and so began a life of sheer enchantment . we knew no one , the visitors in [location] change nearly every season . and no one cared no one asked anything of us . and as for our shipmates , a willing affectionate service was their gift . and no more , looking back , i know in what a wonder world i was privileged to live .
[male] said no more , he left the library without uttering a word to any of the gentlemen . the despair which had seized upon him was too terrible for words . alone , locked in his own room , he gnashed his teeth in agony . while the new baronet abandoned himself to the anguish of disappointed avarice and ambition . [female] sat quietly in her own apartments , brooding very sadly over her husband 's death .
my goodness , [female] exclaimed , i am not a little girl any more , papa , you are always forgetting my age ! and if it 's a family matter i belong to the family . i guess , about as much as anybody else . do not i ? grandpa himself is not any more one of the family than i am .
there are reasons why one would have liked this to be felt , as in general one would like almost anything to be felt . in one 's work , that one has one 's self contributively felt , we have seen . however , how idle is that pretension , which i should be sorry to make too much of . [female] and miss stackpole then are cases . each , of the light ficelle , not of the true agent ; they may run beside the coach `` for all they are worth , ''
the destruction of machines , the pillage of warehouses . the breaking of rails , the demolition of docks . the false routes of multitudes , the refusal by the people of justice to progress . ramus assassinated by students , [male] driven out of [location] and stoned . that is revolt , [male] against [male] , [male] against phocian .
lvov , in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes . was sitting in an armchair , and with a pince nez with blue glasses he was reading a book that stood on a reading desk . while in his beautiful hand he held a half burned cigarette daintily away from him . his handsome , delicate , and still youthful looking face . to which his curly , glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air .
they argued earnestly with [female] , they spoke of raisuli and kaid maclean . but [male] was not to be stopped , the gad fly was vexing him . and he had to move , for a year , he had wandered . realizing every day the truth of [male] 's philosophy for those who travel . that a man can not change his feelings with his climate .
she had raised her white face a little , and it was queer to hear her say these things . at that time of the morning there are comparatively few people out in that part of the town . the broad interminable perspective of the east [location] dock road . the great perspective of drab brick walls . of grey pavement , of muddy roadway rumbling dismally with loaded carts and vans lost itself in the distance .
nor did the captain for a moment imagine that clarissa would have rejected him . had he been in a position to make an offer of his hand . lady geraldine was a fixture at [female] . she was to stay there till her marriage , with the exception . perhaps , of a brief excursion to [location] for millinery purposes .
after all , said the inspector , if he had been rich . he would not have been here , so the matter ended for the abbe faria . he remained in his cell , and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity . caligula or [male] , those treasure seekers . those desirers of the impossible , would have accorded to the poor wretch , in exchange for his wealth .
i have found it all out , aunt [female] , ', said livy . `` you must take the count , '' for livy wanted to give her sister every chance . `` how have you found it out ? '' said the aunt . `` you may be sure it is so , '' said livy . and the lady in her doubt yielded the point .
there was something in his voice that compelled obedience . i leaned back in my chair and shut my eyes . while i looked at the question he had put me fairly and squarely . the question seemed to echo in my ears , i was surprised at myself that i did not at once reply with a passionate affirmative . surely i had suffered enough to welcome dicky 's return at any time .
no living creature was visible or audible -- no bird flew by me . no dog barked from the sexton 's cottage . the pauses in the dull beating of the surf were filled up by the dreary rustling of the dwarf trees near the grave . and the cold faint bubble of the brook over its stony bed . a dreary scene and a dreary hour , my spirits sank fast as i counted out the minutes of the evening in my hiding place under the church porch .
certainly oniton would take some digesting , it would be no small business to remain herself . and yet to assimilate such an establishment , she must remain herself . for his sake as well as her own , since a shadowy wife degrades the husband whom she accompanies . and she must assimilate for reasons of common honesty . since she had no right to marry a man and make him uncomfortable .
what could we say ? what could we do ? we did not try . i busied myself in tying the string on [male] 's blouse that had come untied in the bear hug . and the doctor suddenly discovered the letter on the bench . i saw him see it without looking in his direction at all . `` and how many pounds are we nearer the scarlet runner state of existence , mrs , [female] ? ''
she led the way without a word back into the court . along a few steps , and up again to the house into a little back parlour that the steward used when the house was full . it was unoccupied now , and looked out into the garden whence she was just come . she locked the door when he had entered . and came and sat down out of sight of any that might be passing , sit here , ', she said .
he should then tell him about his great love for his sister . as young men will sacrifice even their lives for the sake of those who may be of the same age . habits , and dispositions as themselves . after this the man should get the girl brought by means of her brother to some secure place . and having brought fire from the house of a brahman .
suddenly the moon smoothed herself out of vapor drift and made the deep night full of pleasure in the eye of her sweet motion . not alone she came leading the starlight with her like a song . and not a bud of all that undergrowth but crisped and tingled out an ardent edge as the light steeped it . over whose massed leaves the portals of illimitable sleep faded in heaven . that is love in its moonrise , not its sunrise stage .
i began to question him , but he now appeared less inclined to talk and more frightened than ever . and each time i attempted to speak he imposed silence . with a quick gesture of alarm , while he continued to stare about him with dilated eyes . all at once he sprang to his feet as if overcome with terror and started running at full speed . his fear infected me , and , springing up , i followed as fast as i could .
`` by god , i will stand by you , [male] ! '' he said , and struck the table smartly with his clenched hand . he flushed instantly , and i felt the blood mounting into my own face as we gazed at each other . —he , bates , the servant , and i , his master ! he had always addressed me so punctiliously with the `` sir '' of respect that his declaration of fealty .
in the afternoon the call was made , the parkers . having children , had dined early , and he was sitting out in a little porch smoking his pipe . drinking whisky and water , and looking at the sea . his eldest girl was standing between his legs , and his wife . with the other three children round her , was sitting on the doorstep .
she waited another few moments , then quietly and firmly pushed him aside . and glided on her path , the moon whitening her hot blush away . but it had been enough -- new relations between them had begun . the case of the other girls was different , as has been said , they wrestled and tittered . only escaping after a desperate struggle , [male] could hear these enactments still going on after [male] had left him .
at the period when the people ofsampson were particularly excited on the subject of gilliatt . the last persons who had seen the king of the auxcriniers declared that his pelerine was now ornamented with only thirteen shells , thirteen ! he was only the more dangerous , but what had become of the fourteenth ? had he given it to some one ? no one would say positively ; and folks confined themselves to conjecture . but it was an undoubted fact that a certain mons .
gudrun went on her way half dazed . if this were human life , if these were human beings , living in a complete world . then what was her own world , outside ? she was aware of her grass green stockings . her large grass green velour hat , her full soft coat . of a strong blue colour , and she felt as if she were treading in the air .
on such an evening , when the city grit gets into the hair and eyes and skin . and when the fallen leaves of the few unhappy city trees grind down in corners under wheels of wind . the schoolmaster and the pupil emerged upon the leadenhall street region . spying eastward for [female] , being something too soon in their arrival . they lurked at a corner , waiting for her to appear , the best looking among [female] will not look very well .
he found an ample supply of theological books in the city book shops . and with these his studies were recommenced in a different spirit and direction from his former course . as a relaxation from the fathers , and such stock works as [male] and [male] . he read newman , pusey , and many other modern lights . he hired a harmonium , set it up in his lodging .
but he was not listened to , and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the spaniards . the men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths . leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers . for on approaching nearer , instead of one extended figure , the young men discovered two . [male] fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man .
i have been thinking much today of aunt [female] . perhaps it is because [female] was here last night . she was afraid i would marry him . i did not tell [male] i was coming to scarborough square to live . i told no one , the day after i reached here i sent him a note .
let the reader picture to himself now . this immense , oblong hall , illuminated by the pallid light of a january day . invaded by a [location] and [male] which drifts along the walls . and eddies round the seven pillars , and he will have a confused idea of the whole effect of the picture . whose curious details we shall make an effort to indicate with more precision .
at length tuesday came , the last and most tumultuous day of the carnival . on tuesday , the theatres open at ten o'clock in the morning . as lent begins after eight at night , on tuesday . all those who through want of money , time , or enthusiasm . have not been to see the carnival before , mingle in the gayety .
he quickly rubbed out what he had written , gave her the chalk . and stood up , she wrote , t , i , c . n , a , d , [female] was completely comforted in the depression caused by her conversation with alexey alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the two figures . [female] with the chalk in her hand . with a shy and happy smile looking upwards at levin .
`` and all the world knows -- '' but he would not proceed to declare that all the world knew that also crosbie had been well thrashed for his baseness . it would not become him to mention that , even before his mother and sister . all the world did know it ; all the world that cared to know anything of the matter . except [female] herself , nobody had ever yet told [female] of that occurrence at the paddington railway station . and it was well for [female] that her friends and his had been so discreet .
it was as if at home , by contrast . there were neither -- neither the difference itself , from position to position . nor , on either side , and particularly on one , the awfully good manner . the conscious sinking of a consciousness , that made up for it . the conscious sinking , at all events , and the awfully good manner .
`` without doubt , sir , '' said the sergeant . and with the most deferential salute , and another confidential smile . he turned and rode back by the way he had come . no doubt he wished that he could meet a gentleman who was . not the king -- every morning of his life .
hence it was to the traveling men . not to supercilious tourists in limousines , that milt turned for suggestions as to how to perform the miracle of changing from an ambitious boy into what claire would recognize as a charming man . he had not met enough traveling men at schoenstrom . they scooped up what little business there was , and escaped from the leipzig house to spend the night at st . cloud or sauk centre .
so sensibly , that he had constantly to keep his brain in check . and all the time she was in fancy looking up through a telescope at white shadow cleft disks which were other worlds . until she felt herself possessed of two bodies . one walking by the river with denham . the other concentrated to a silver globe aloft in the fine blue space above the scum of vapors that was covering the visible world .
the man had not plunged into the earth , but he had gone with great strides through the dark . down the principal street of chelles , then he had turned to the right before reaching the church . into the cross road leading to montfermeil , like a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before . he followed this road rapidly , at the spot where it is intersected by the ancient tree bordered road which runs from gagny to [male] . he heard people coming , he concealed himself precipitately in a ditch .
throwing herself down in front of it . mrs. [female] breathed , `` at last , oh , for some tea , '' through the window . [female] had a glimpse of a deeply indented bay at the foot of cliffs below them . with a bold headland to the right , fishing vessels with flat red sails seemed to hang undecided just outside the bay . from cottage chimneys beneath the road blue smoke softly ascended .
it struck [female] that she had not heard of the confession which had been made by [male] on his death bed . he remembered job legh 's discretion . and he determined that if it could be avoided his mother should never hear of it . many of the difficulties to be anticipated in preserving the secret would be obviated , if he could induce his mother to fall into the plan he had named to [male] of emigrating to [location] . the reasons which rendered this secrecy desirable related to the domestic happiness he hoped for .
but [male] , whose ideas had taken quite another course . forgot himself like a fool , and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts . this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified [female] . whose questions became more pressing , [male] fancied himself very cunning when advising [female] to renounce . by pardoning [female] wardes , the furious projects she had formed .
his life-long friend , his only friend , the deemster no longer . but only the man , not the man either , but the child . the cruel years had rolled back with all their burden of trouble . forgotten days were come again -- days long buried under the debris of memory . they were boys together again , a little , sunny fellow in velvet .
so strange a reception naturally gave [female] ample matter for reflection . so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation , she reclined in her corner of the carriage . and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind . at the end of a quarter of an hour . however , surprised at the length of the journey , she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted .
but he was haunted by the sense of what might be called an important social opportunity in the form of mrs. [female] . he was compelled to set over against his natural tendency toward [male] a consciousness of what he was ignoring in the personality and fortunes of her rival . who was one of the most significant and interesting figures on the social horizon , for think as he would . these two women were now persistently opposed in his consciousness , the one polished . sympathetic , philosophic -- schooled in all the niceties of polite society , and with the means to gratify her every wish .
he pushed it gently with the tip of his finger . lightly , with the furtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering . the door yielded to this pressure , and made an imperceptible and silent movement . which enlarged the opening a little , he waited a moment ; then gave the door a second and a bolder push . it continued to yield in silence , the opening was now large enough to allow him to pass .
all at once [female] exclaimed : `` father , i should think some one was coming yonder . '' [male] raised his eyes , [male] was right . the causeway which leads to the ancient barriere [male] maine is a prolongation . as the reader knows , of the rue [male] sevres . and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard , at the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard .
thorpe knew that he could play safely , cutting a few millions a year , expanding cautiously . by this method he would arrive , but only after a long period . or he could do as many other firms have done ; start on borrowed money . in the latter case he had only one thing to fear . and that was fire , every cent , and many times over .
but to [male] , now that he was about to lose her . she seemed each moment more desirable , he looked at her . instead of through her , for the first time since they were engaged , from a [female] she had become a living woman . with mysteries and forces of her own , with qualities that even eluded art . his brain recovered from the shock , and , in a burst of genuine devotion .
jolyon had looked at her , and the sad whimsicality of his face impressed her deeply . but the most poignant memory of that little visit had been watching , unobserved , her stepmother reading to herself a letter from jon . it was -- she decided -- the prettiest sight she had ever seen . [female] , lost as it were in the letter of her boy . stood at a window where the light fell on her face and her fine grey hair .
here , at the extreme left flank , [female] talked a great deal and with much heat . and , as it seemed to [female] , gave orders of great military importance . in front of tuchkov 's troops was some high ground not occupied by troops . [female] loudly criticized this mistake , saying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below it . some of the generals expressed the same opinion , one in particular declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered .
the council squatted upon the steps of the rostrum . while below them stood the prisoner and her two guards . i saw that one of the women was sarkoja , and thus understood how she had been present at the hearing of the preceding day . the results of which she had reported to the occupants of our dormitory last night . her attitude toward the captive was most harsh and brutal , when she held her .
lester had been away from [male] so long now that the first severe wave of self reproach had passed . he was still doubtful , but he preferred to stifle his misgivings . `` very well , '' he replied , almost jokingly , `` only do not let there be any fuss about it . '' `` do you really mean that , sweet ? '' she exclaimed , looking over at him . they had been spending the evening together quietly reading and chatting , she came over to him and sat on his knee .
the sister became a dancer , there was a ruined uncle in the family group . ruined by his brother , the father of the marshalsea . and knowing no more how than his ruiner did , but accepting the fact as an inevitable certainty . on whom her protection devolved , naturally a retired and simple man , he had shown no particular sense of being ruined at the time when that calamity fell upon him . further than that he left off washing himself when the shock was announced .
i find that your story about mrs. [female] is in the main true . but the person who told it you does not seem to have known any of the provocations which she received . she was very badly treated by captain [female] . who , i am afraid , was a terrible drunkard ; and at last she found it impossible to stay with him . so she went away , i can not tell you how horrid it all was .
leaving his sentence unfinished , he seized pen and paper and wrote to jo . telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind . could not she , would not she -- and let him come home and be happy ? while waiting for an answer he did nothing . but he did it energetically , for he was in a fever of impatience .
in the beginning , the nation asks nothing but repose . it thirsts for but one thing , [male] ; it has but one ambition . to be small , which is the translation of remaining tranquil , of great events . great hazards , great adventures , great men . thank god , we have seen enough .
then he tried an opera , for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning . but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him , he wanted jo for his heroine . and called upon his memory to supply him with tender recollections and romantic visions of his love . but memory turned traitor , and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl . would only recall jo 's oddities , faults , and freaks .
she saw lady gwendoline on her knees at the bottom of the bed . with her face buried in the silken coverlet , and her arms thrown up above her head . but in the next moment [female] saw her . and came to her , he closed the door softly behind him . and shut out that group of bending figures , she would have spoken .
there are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty . a fine and white stocking , a silken robe , a lace kerchief . a pretty slipper on the foot , a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty . but they make a pretty woman beautiful . without reckoning the hands , which gain by all this ; the hands , among women particularly .
athos sprang from his horse . gave the bridle to [male] , and advanced toward the window . after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door . the little house was surrounded by a low , quickset hedge , two or three feet high . [male] sprang over the hedge and went up to the window .
the windows of the house before which they were stopping . were closed , and [male] perceived at once that the hotel was not inhabited , the cabman must have perceived it also . as for the man who had taken the child , the nurse could only say that he was dressed in [male] . like a waiter , that he had a napkin under his arm . and no hat on his head , he had taken the boy tenderly in his arms .
mrs. [female] smiled and said good-bye and thanked him . without the least trouble and at once she had got him placed in his proper category . he was an artist and of an effervescent temperament . she shook hands and left , and he wished she had not . after she was gone he supposed that he ought to have asked for those references .
the redoubt had been cleverly made over , into a wall on the inside and a thicket on the outside . the staircase of paving stones which permitted one to mount it like the wall of a citadel had been reconstructed . the barricade had been put in order , the tap room disencumbered . the kitchen appropriated for the ambulance , the dressing of the wounded completed . the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been gathered up .
reads aloud well , the stipulation had enchanted susy . she had never before known children who cared to be read aloud to ; she remembered with a shiver her attempts to interest clarissa in anything but gossip and the fashions . and the tone in which the child had said , showing strefford 's trinket to her father . `` because i said i would rather have it than a book . '' and here were children who consented to be left for three months by their parents .
the reaction from his certainty in the cabin to uncertainty again made him fretful and sleepless . it was almost morning before he relaxed on his hard hotel bed enough to sleep . by the time he had bathed he had developed a sort of philosophic acceptance of the new situation . there would be no exclusive story now , no scoop , the events of the next few hours were for every man to read . he shrugged his shoulders as , partially dressed , he carried his shaving materials into the better light of his bedroom .
in the brief interval of time which [male] had spent in the state room . chatting with [male] about the latter 's bruised soul . some rather curious things had been happening above , not extraordinary , perhaps , but curious . these must now be related , a story , if it is to grip the reader . should , i am aware , go always forward , it should march , it should leap from crag to crag like the chamois of the alps .
not , indeed , that he had definitely any faith in the persistence of the human spirit . the feeling was not so logical -- it was , rather , an atmospheric impact . like a scent , or one of those strong animistic impressions from forms . or effects of light , to which those with the artist 's eye are especially prone . here only -- in this little unchanged room where his father had spent the most of his waking hours .
by crossing a hotel yard , a fragment of kitchen garden and a bowling green . we were able to come within a few yards of where mr. bundercombe . with several other of mr. [male] supporters , was standing upon a small raised platform . two local tradesmen and one helper from [location] addressed a few remarks of the usual sort to an apathetic audience . which was rapidly increasing in size , it was only when mr. bundercombe rose to his feet that the slightest sign of enthusiasm manifested itself .
presently he had the little girl listen to a pewee twittering in a thorn bush and the lusty call of a robin from an apple tree . a bluebird flew over head with a [male] chirp -- its wistful note of autumn long since forgotten . these were the first birds and flowers , he said . and june , knowing them only by sight . must know the name of each and the reason for that name .
it is the language which has been spoken , in [location] . for example , for more than four centuries , not only by a misery . but by every possible human misery , and then , we insist upon it . the study of social deformities and infirmities . and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy .
the letter from mrs. [female] . which the reader has just seen , was the immediate effect of a special visit which mr. [male] had made to her . on the 10th of march he had come to her with a settled purpose . pointing out to her that he had now waited a certain number of months since he had heard of the rupture between [female] and her [female] . naming the exact period which mrs. [male] had bade him wait before he should move again in the matter .
the boy observed stolidly , in french , that it was not ready until noon . she was able to make out , from his failing to depart , that there was no roast beef . `` good gracious , '' she said , ravenous and exasperated , `` go and get me some bread and coffee , anyhow . '' she repeated it , slightly louder , that was the tableau that [male] found when . after a custom that may be war or may be continental , he had inquired the number of her room and made his way there .
[female] breathed the words in an undertone that carried more than a hint of dismay . it was one of those rare crises in life when the brain receives a presage of evil without any prior foundation of fact . [female] had every reason to welcome her friend . none to be chilled by her unexpected presence , among a small circle of intimate acquaintances she counted millicent [female] the best and truest . they had drifted apart ; but that was owing to [female] 's lack of means .
[female] knew the girl , and he talked to her a little in the boat . no one present understood what they said , her name was mariequita . she had a round , sly , piquant face and pretty [female] eyes . her hands were small , and she kept them folded over the handle of her basket . her feet were broad and coarse , she did not strive to hide them .
you may perhaps have been somewhat surprised my dearest marianne , that in the distress i then endured . destitute of any support , and unprovided with any habitation . i should never once have remembered my father and mother or my paternal cottage in the vale of uske . to account for this seeming forgetfullness i must inform you of a trifling circumstance concerning them which i have as yet never mentioned . the death of my parents a few weeks after my departure .
the majestic bulwark of san [female] mountain looms in the southern horizon of [location] . it was in full sight from the door of the little shanty in which aunt ri 's carpet loom stood . as she sat there hour after hour . sometimes seven hours to the day , working the heavy treadle . and slipping the shuttle back and forth , she gazed with tender yearnings at the solemn , shining summit .
but [female] dared not depend upon him to man one of the watch towers . eye and hand were too unsteady to do good service in picking off escaladers . the ex soldier was brave enough for any feat , however , and was delighted when the englishman suggested . rather than gave orders , that his should be the duty of lighting the bonfires . that done , he was to take his stand in the courtyard .
in his youth [male] had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military . but he was cured of all those hot headed propensities ; besides , he had the cardinal 's hundred pistoles in his pocket . so he went into the hotel without a word . there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening . but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good burgundy .
yet few knew , and still fewer considered this , a small minority , mainly strangers . would look long at her in casually passing by , and grow momentarily fascinated by her freshness . and wonder if they would ever see her again : but to almost everybody she was a fine and picturesque country girl . and no more , nothing was seen or heard further of durbeyfield in his triumphal chariot under the conduct of the ostleress . and the club having entered the allotted space , dancing began , as there were no men in the company .
give my best love to my mother and sisters . if you will receive me during the time of the election . i shall see them soon , perhaps it will be best for me to say that i have positively decided on making the attempt . that is to say , if the club committee is as good as its promise . i have weighed the matter all round .
the circumstance was told him at hartfield . for the moment , he was silent ; but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself . over a newspaper he held in his hand , hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow i took him for . she had half a mind to resent .
the mother was half inclined to smile ; but [male] smiled at any one 's religious beliefs , howsoever foolish . he held in universal sacredness that one rare thing , sincerity . above all , what would that noble parent have said , had he been aware that this . his only son , for whom , report whispered , he was already planning a splendid marriage . as grand in a financial point of view as that he planned for his only daughter .
after two months he was sufficiently restored to go to [male] . at the invitation of his divorced wife 's family . to see his child , then back to sweden , to lund , a university town . where he lived solely to absorb swedenborg , by may of that year he was able to go to work on `` the inferno , '' that record of a soul 's nightmare .
the two gentlemen had not dressed strictly for dinner , they had spent a great part of the day handling the hounds and the horses . dressing wounds , curing sores , and ministering to canine ailments . and had been detained over their work too long to think of their toilet , as it was they had an eye to business . the stables at one corner and the kennels at the other were close to the little garden . and the doings of a man and a boy who were still at work among the animals could be directed from the armchairs on which the two sportsmen were sitting .
to what wild spot had the animal brought him ? [male] lifted his head and looked about him . and it was as if he had been caught up and dropped in an enchanted wood . the horse had climbed among great boulders and paused beneath an enormous overhanging rock . he heard , off at one side , the rushing sound of a mountain stream and judged he was near the head of lone pine creek . but oh , the wildness of the spot and the beauty of it and the lonely charm !
she returned to the house with her father . when she had again ascended to the landing and to her own rooms beyond it was a great relief to her to find that both petticoat the first and petticoat the second of her bien aime had silently disappeared . they had , in all probability , heard the words of her father . and departed with their anxieties relieved , presently her parents came up to [female] . and busied themselves to see that she was comfortable , perceiving soon that she would prefer to be left alone they went away .
dejah thoris went aboard the flagship . and was much put out that i would not follow , but , as i explained to her . the battle was but partly won ; we still had the land forces of the besieging zodangans to account for . and i would not leave tars tarkas until that had been accomplished , the commander of the naval forces of helium promised to arrange to have the armies of helium attack from the city in conjunction with our land attack . and so the vessels separated and dejah thoris was borne in triumph back to the court of her grandfather .
she looked at him , as he leaned back against the faint crystal of the lantern light . she could see his face , although it was a pure shadow . but it was a piece of twilight . and her breast was keen with passion for him . he was so beautiful in his male stillness and mystery .
stark recognized the captain , there were others . four of them , young , old , intermediate , annoyed at being hauled away from their beds and their gaming tables at this hour . the sixth man wore the jewelled cuirass of a noble , he had a nice . a kind face , grey hair . mild eyes , soft cheeks , a fine man .
but that woman 's vice had given her her success . her joy , her great triumph ! it was surely not for her to deal hardly with the faults of [female] brabazon . for her who was enjoying all the blessings of which those faults had robbed the other ! [female] brabazon had been her very good friend .
this constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has probably not forgotten , little cosette . it will be remembered that cosette was useful to the thenardiers in two ways . they made the mother pay them . and they made the child serve them . so when the mother ceased to pay altogether , the reason for which we have read in preceding chapters .
and this dear `` parrain '' took her hand and lifted it to his grateful lips . upon which demonstration , i saw the light complexioned young teuton . [male] mühler , grow restless . as if he did not like it , he even grumbled a few words . whereat [male] actually laughed in his face .
if rose had ever felt that the gift of living for others was a poor one . she saw now how beautiful and blessed it was how rich the returns . how wide the influence , how much more precious the tender tie which knit so many hearts together than any breath of fame or brilliant talent that dazzled but did not win and warm . in after years she found how true her uncle 's words had been and . listening to eulogies of great men , felt less moved and inspired by praises of their splendid gifts than by the sight of some good man 's patient labor for the poorest of his kind .
but he gathered no tidings by the way . for [female] by the mill knew nothing . and the woman by the sundial had gone to bed . at length he dipped into port mooar . and came to a little cottage like a child 's noah 's ark .
bar , handling his persuasive double eye glass , was by no means clear but that it might be four . it was one of those happy strokes of calculation and combination . the result of which it was difficult to estimate , it was one of those instances of a comprehensive grasp . associated with habitual luck and characteristic boldness , of which an age presented [male] but few . but here was brother bellows , who had been in the great bank case .
he could see the impression he was making on cardigan . again his faith in the psychology of the mind found its absolute verification . cardigan , lifted unexpectedly out of the slough of despond by the very man whom he expected to condemn him . became from that moment , in the face of the mental reaction , almost hypersympathetic . when finally he left the room , kent was inwardly rejoicing .
the sense of having made an end of his difficulties . and being moored in a safe harbour for the rest of his life . may have done much towards giving him a new lease of existence . whatever the cause may have been , he was certainly an altered man . and his daughter rejoiced in the change , to her his manner was at once affectionate and deferential .
[male] watched the mother and child sometimes with haggard eyes . speculating on the future , if the boy lived , who was to have him ? the mother , whose guilt or innocence was an open question . who had owned to being at heart false to her husband . or the father , who had done nothing to forfeit the right to his keeping ?
during the brief interval between mrs. [female] 's leaving her room and the evening appointed for the ball . [male] arundel found no very convenient opportunity of informing his [male] of the engagement entered into between himself and [male] . he had no wish to hurry this disclosure ; for there was something in the orphan girl 's childishness and innocence that kept all definite ideas of an early marriage very far away from her lover 's mind . he wanted to go back to [location] , and win more laurels . to lay at the feet of the [male] of [male] towers .
that you admit no sworn confidant or intimate of your own sex . no she friend to screen her affairs under your countenance . and tempt you to make trial of a mutual secrecy . no decoy duck to wheedle you a fop scrambling to the play in a mask . then bring you home in a pretended fright , when you think you shall be found out .
on grinding day , the ozark mountaineer goes to mill on horse-back . his grist in a sack behind the saddle . or , indeed , taking place of the saddle itself , the rule is . first come , first served , so , while waiting his turn , or waiting for a neighbor who will ride in the same direction . the woodsman has time to contribute his share to the gossip of the country side .
when [female] , who had picked her up and laid her on the couch . asked if he should not get a doctor , mrs. [female] had said no . and said it so positively that he offered to do nothing else . and then she thanked him and told him good night in such a way he understood it was best he should go . at the front door he called me .
perhaps it was absurd to pay attention to this indictment of a noble woman by a potter 's toy . but that toy happened to be also a little image of [female] 's conception of women . exquisite we were according to our equipment , unflushed by appetite or passion . even noble passion , our small heads bent intently on the white flowers of luxury floating on the [male] waters of life . he had known none other than us .
then suddenly that love , that devotion , which throughout his courtship she had looked upon as the slavish fidelity of a dog . seemed to vanish completely , twenty-four hours after the simple little ceremony at oldroch . she had told him the story of how . inadvertently , she had spoken of certain matters connected with the marquis decyr before some men . her friends -- who had used this information against the unfortunate marquis .
so he tried to think that she was with him . sitting in the chair opposite , looking across the table between the white cloth and the blue lamp shade . out of her beaming eyes , with her rings of dark hair dancing on her forehead . and her ripe mouth twitching merrily , then the air of the room seemed to be filled with a sweet presence . he could have fancied there was a perfume of lace and dainty things , `` sweetheart ! ''
gurth , gallantly apparelled , attended as esquire upon his young master whom he had served so faithfully . and the magnanimous wamba , decorated with a new cap and a most gorgeous set of silver bells . sharers of wilfred 's dangers and adversity . they remained , as they had a right to expect . the partakers of his more prosperous career , but besides this domestic retinue .
in the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the town . and a sergeant and his party had been beating up for recruits through the four streets . as the end of the day drew on , and he found himself not hired . [male] almost wished that he had joined them . and gone off to serve his country , weary of standing in the market place , and not much minding the kind of work he turned his hand to .
[male] his hands , he was tempted to say that he knew nothing about the thing at all . but a commercial training was too strong for him , nor could he say it was a bad thing . for this would be giving it away ; nor yet that it was good , for this would be giving it away equally . he attempted to suggest that it was something between the two . with vast possibilities in either direction , but broke down under the gaze of four sincere eyes .
the host , who saw two young noblemen , richly clad . promised everything they required , and our two cavaliers . after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun , started off again and proceeded rapidly toward greney . they had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the first houses of the village . the red tiled roofs of which stood out from the green trees which surrounded them .
it was a long time since any one had spoken to him as kindly as mrs. [female] . most people were either indifferent to his troubles , or disposed to think it natural that a young fellow of his age should have carried without repining the burden of three crippled lives . but mrs. [male] had said , you have had an awful mean time . ethan frome , and he felt less alone with his misery . if the hales were sorry for him they would surely respond to his appeal ...
here his captors were joined by two other persons , apparently belonging to the gang . they had short swords by their sides . and quarter staves in their hands , and [location] could now observe that all six wore visors . which rendered their occupation a matter of no question . even had their former proceedings left it in doubt .
messrs. [female] in [organization] 's inn had for very many years been the lawyers of the stowte family . and probably knew as much about the property as any of the stowtes themselves . they had not been consulted about the giving away of the bit of land for the chapel purposes . nor had they been instructed to draw up any deed of gift . the whole thing had been done irregularly , the land had been only promised , and not in truth as yet given .
they ran to some steps leading down to the water . they beckoned to some watermen , who , suspecting the real state of the case . appeared in no hurry for a fare , but leisurely brought their boat alongside the stairs . as if it were a matter of indifference to them whether they were engaged or not . while they conversed together in few words , and in an undertone .
evidently of excellent family , she was sufficiently assured of her position not to be sensitive about its recognition by others . and preferred to instil into her daughter 's mind sound wholesome principles to useless and giddy accomplishments . and yet the daughter was accomplished , an excellent musician upon the piano and harp . and a vocalist of rare sweetness and perfection of execution . as well as [female] of other usual studies of her sex .
they stood silent for a moment . he with his eyes fixed on her . she with averted head , twisting her riding whip between her fingers . then she said suddenly : `` we shall be late for dinner , '' and passing into her dressing room she closed the door .
`` here we are , '' and he drew a letter from his pocket written in a bold . but somewhat uneducated , woman 's hand , as he did so he caught sight of the figure of a tall gentleman strolling idly towards the office door . for a moment he stared at him blankly . as a man does when he is trying to catch the vague clue to a new idea . then , as the figure passed out of his view , he brought his fist down heavily upon the sill .
it had been settled that parliament should meet on the thursday in easter week . and it was known to the world at large that cabinet councils were held on the friday previous . on the monday , and on the tuesday ; but nobody knew what took place at those meetings . cabinet councils are , of course , very secret . what kind of oath the members take not to divulge any tittle of the proceedings at these awful conferences .
she opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold . damp earthen floor of the passage , the cold she felt refreshed her . with her bare feet she touched a sleeping man . stepped over him , and opened the door into the part of the hut where prince [male] lay . it was dark in there , in the farthest corner , on a bench beside a bed on which something was lying .
today , not for the first time , [female] was feeling unhappy . the face that looked back at her out of the mirror at which she was arranging her most becoming hat was weary . it was only a moderately pretty face , but loneliness and underfeeding had given it a wistful expression that had charm . unfortunately , it was not the sort of charm which made a great appeal to the stout . whisky nourished men who sat behind paper littered tables , smoking cigars .
during the rest of the day she did nothing but walk up and down the garden path in a state bordering on stupefaction . night came , and with it but little rest . the next day , with an instinct to do something which should reduce prostration to mournfulness . she went to her son 's room . and with her own hands arranged it in order .
what had he to do , indeed ? he did not care for cards . he did not go to a club , spending the time with jovial gentlemen of oblonsky 's type . she knew now what that meant ... it meant drinking and going somewhere after drinking . she could not think without horror of where men went on such occasions . was he to go into society ? but she knew he could only find satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society of young women .
would you believe it ? the king and the whole round table were in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure . every knight of the table jumped for the chance . and begged for it ; but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me . who had not asked for it at all , by an effort , i contained my joy when [male] brought me the news . but he -- he could not contain his , his mouth gushed delight and gratitude in a steady discharge .
towards the last of these long seven weeks i admitted , what through the other six i had jealously excluded . the conviction that these blanks were inevitable : the result of circumstances . the fiat of fate , a part of my life 's lot and . above all -- a matter about whose origin no question must ever be asked , for whose painful sequence no murmur ever uttered . of course i did not blame myself for suffering .
in an instant each moslem cast himself from his horse . turned his face towards mecca . and performed with sand an imitation of those ablutions . which were elsewhere required to be made with water , while each individual , in brief but fervent ejaculations . recommended himself to the care , and his sins to the forgiveness .
lucilla and i happened , on that evening . to be guests at the rectory table . it was one of the regular occasions on which we left our own side of the house . and joined the family at `` the pastor 's evening meal . '' he had got his wife ; he had got his eldest daughter .
and yet the idea of departing was further than ever from his mind . the sloop being fixed in its new position , he went in [male] of the strongest chain which he had in his store cavern . and attaching it to the nails driven into the two douvres . he fortified from within with this chain the rampart of planks and beams . already protected from without by the cross chain , far from opening the entrance to the defile .
[female] had been to make a reconnaissance , he had made his way out through mondetour lane . gliding along close to the houses , the insurgents , we will remark . were full of hope , the manner in which they had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to almost disdain in advance the attack at dawn . they waited for it with a smile . they had no more doubt as to their success than as to their cause .
but [male] 's sand wallow was empty , and [male] was gone . [male] was on his way to the mystery of the bundle he had found in the jackpines . at the foot of the ridge , where the green plain fought with the blighting edge of the stew kettle . he stood for many minutes before he started east ward . with keen eyes gleaming behind his mop of scraggly face bristles he critically surveyed both land and air .
suddenly i remembered hearing mrs. tod say that , on account of its pits and quarries . the common was extremely dangerous after dark , except to those who knew it well . in a horrible dread i called out [female] 's name . but nothing answered , i went on blindly , desperately shouting as i went , at length . in one of the roman fosses , i stumbled and fell , some one came .
they gave the beholder an impression of something weird and spectral . he wondered what prey secured , or what expectation about to be realised . moved with a joyous thrill this magnificent network of living fire . from the projections of the vault , and the angles of the rock . hung lengths of delicate fibrous plants , bathing their roots probably through the granite in some upper pool of water .
`` if you mean my two nieces , '' said mrs greenow . i am afraid you will find they are engaged . but if i am not too old to walk with -- the captain assured her that she was just of the proper age for a walking companion . as far as his taste went , and then attempted some apology for the awkwardness of his expression . at which the three women laughed heartily , `` never mind , captain , ''
one has beheld hands on which there was blood ; there was a deafening horror . there was also a frightful silence ; there were open mouths which shouted , and other open mouths which held their [male] . one was in the midst of smoke , of night , perhaps . one fancied that one had touched the sinister ooze of unknown depths . one stares at something red on one 's finger nails .
he did not want bateese to suspect this change in him . and he slouched lower against the dunnage pack with his eyes still on the girl . he was finding it increasingly difficult to keep from looking at her . she had resumed her paddling , and bateese was putting mighty efforts in his strokes now . so that the narrow , [female] shot like an arrow with the down sweeping current of the river .
oh , it goes from high to low quicker , more notes in a bunch . and sweeter tones trilling , explained [male] . mr. [male] laughed , saying in a question of music that would constitute quite a difference . they went to the brook and lunched and made easy records of syllabic calls that could be rendered in words and by whistling . then all of them gathered around mr. [male] while he drew lines .
never again shall i wonder that the sea is hard , i walked apart from the second mate and stared up at the magnificent fabric of the elsinore sweeping and swaying great blotting curves of darkness across the face of the starry sky . something has happened , but nobody knows , either fore or aft . except the interested persons , and they will not say anything . yet the ship is abuzz with rumours and guesses . this i do know : mr. [male] has received a fearful blow on the head .
in this way it happened that [female] and [female] were walking towards the same spot at the same time . [male] had on his working dress again , now , for he had thrown off the other with a sense of relief as soon as he came home . and if he had had the basket of tools over his shoulder . he might have been taken , with his pale wasted face . for the spectre of the [male] bede who entered the grove on that august evening eight months ago .
she doubted the reality of mrs. [female] 's illness . she doubted any want beyond a momentary fancy on that lady 's part . which should take her out of her previously settled course of employment for the day . she told her son that she wished they had never come near the place . that he had never got acquainted with them ; that there had been no such useless languages as [location] and greek ever invented .
poor mr. [male] was distrustful of everybody 's feeling towards him . especially as a husband , to let any one suppose that he was jealous would be to admit their view of his disadvantages . to let them know that he did not find marriage particularly blissful would imply his conversion to their earlier disapproval . it would be as bad as letting carp , and brasenose generally , know how backward he was in organizing the matter for his `` key to all mythologies . '' all through his life mr. [male] had been trying not to admit even to himself the inward sores of self doubt and jealousy .
much as sir owen wished to ask how his countess had fared through the time of his absence . he stole away , after he had stamped out his fire . towards midnight there came a great roaring wind . and a shower of hailstones , and thunder and lightning . and he saw three great [male] shapes descend from the sky .
it was hours later , stark walked across the glowing ice of the valley . toward the cairn , the sword of ban cruach hung at his side . he had taken the talisman and replaced it in the boss . and he was himself again , [male] and balin walked beside him . the color had come back into their faces , but faintly , and they were still weak enough to be glad of stark 's hands to steady them .
dolly could not help sighing , her dearest friend , her sister , was going away . and her life was not a cheerful one , her relations with stepan arkadyevitch after their reconciliation had become humiliating . the union [female] had cemented turned out to be of no solid character . and family harmony was breaking down again at the same point . there had been nothing definite , but stepan arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home .
very great was the feast in chitor , and the wines that those accursed should not drink ( since the outcast whom they call their prophet forbade them ) . ran like water , and at the right hand of allah u din was set the great crystal cup inlaid with gold by a craft that is now perished . and he filled and refilled it -- may his own prophet curse the swine ! but because the sons of kings eat not with the outcasts . the rana entered after , clothed in chain armor of blue steel .
he had not ridden far when he discerned his own gray mare standing under some bushes . leaving [male] for a moment , [male] went forward and easily caught the younger animal . now disheartened at its freak , he then made the pair of them fast to a tree . and turning back , endeavored to find some trace of [male] , feeling pitifully that . after all , he had gone further than he intended with the offender .
david was interested in this young family ; they seemed to him to be quite of the better sort . and as he put space between himself and the widow timms deplorable state , his irritation gradually passed , and he was able to take note of the changes a week had wrought in the growing things about him . more than once he diverged to investigate blossoming shrubs which were new to him . attracted now by a sweet odor where no flowers appeared , until closer inspection revealed them .
at three o'clock , with a slight headache from concentration . she went upstairs and put up her hair again . rather high this time to make her feel taller . of course , it was not likely he would come . he was very busy , so many people depended on him .
[male] never knew how he got out of the churchyard . he crawled out -- creeping along by the wall , and slinking through the gate . heart sick and all but heart dead , when he came to himself , he was standing in athol street . and a company of jolly fellows in a jaunting car . driving out of the golden sunset , were rattling past him with shouts and peals of laughter .
sophy viner , after moving uncertainly about the room . had placed herself beyond mrs. leath . in a chair near the piano , where she sat with head thrown back and eyes attached to the musician . in the same rapt fixity of attention with which she had followed the players at the francais . the accident of her having fallen into the same attitude , and of her wearing the same dress .
[female] had been kept awake during the dark hours with a sound in her ears that was like the measured ringing of far-off bells . when the daylight came she slept a troubled sleep . and when she awoke she had a sense of stupefaction . as if she had taken a drug , and was not yet recovered from the effects of it . [female] came bouncing into her room and crying .
`` too late -- i have lost it , '' said [male] . and there was yet more laughter , to put an end to this frivolity . casar raised a hymn , and they sang it together with cheerful voices . then casar prayed appropriately , [male] the clerk improvised responses . and pete went out and sat on the bottom step in the lobby and smoked up the stairs .
mr. [male] hesitated , glanced at [male] dene . seemed about to speak , then evidently thinking better of it withdrew , closing the door noiselessly behind him . all the day he had shown marked irritability under the constant interruptions to which he had been subjected . they worked on steadily for a quarter of an hour . presently there was a gentle tap at the door , with one bound [male] dene was out of his chair and across the room .
morrice , who wished nothing so little as disobliging mr monckton . and whose behaviour was merely the result of levity and a want of early education . no sooner perceived his displeasure , than , rising with yet more agility than he had seated himself . he resumed the obsequiousness of which an uncommon flow of spirits had robbed him . and guessing no other subject for his anger than the disturbance he had made .
i will not swear , reader , that there was not something of repressed sarcasm both in the tone in which i uttered this sentence . and in the feeling that accompanied it , i had silently fearedjohn till now . because i had not understood him , he had held me in awe . because he had held me in doubt . how much of him was saint , how much mortal .
birkin turned away , looking out of the window and letting go his consciousness . after all , what good was this ? it was hopeless to keep it up . he would sit on till ursula came home . then speak to her , then go away , he would not accept trouble at the hands of her father . it was all unnecessary , and he himself need not have provoked it .
there was one other englishman present , mr. [male] hyde [male] . from the foreign office , now serving temporarily at the english legation in [male] . and an american , mr. [male] , a man of wealth and taste . who was resolved on having such a collection of pictures at his house in [location] that no english private collection should in any way come near to it . and a tuscan , from the italian foreign office , to whom nobody could speak except mr. [male] hyde [male] .
they took their seats on benches . and awaited the deputation , the latter , gloomily and ferociously , delivered the masters ultimatum , adding thereto not one word of their own . and it sank all the deeper into the sore hearts of the listeners for their forbearance . then the gentleman from [location] ( who had been previously informed of the masters
clover was to care for the two roses ; [female] to oversee the table arrangements . and make sure that all was right in that direction , dear little [female] was indefatigable as a doer of errands . and her quick feet were at everybody 's service to `` save steps . '' cecy arrived , and haunted the house all day long . anxious to be of use to somebody ; mrs. [female] put her time at their disposal .
chad cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance today . for he has got his clean sunday face , which always makes his little granddaughter cry at him as a stranger . but an experienced eye would have fixed on him at once as the village blacksmith . after seeing the humble deference with which the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the farmers . for chad was accustomed to say that a working man must hold a candle to a personage understood to be as [male] as he was himself on weekdays .
the corner of a den down stairs , filled by a very comfortable leather lounge . a small light is on each side above , and in the middle . over the couch hangs a painting of a very old , very dignified gentleman , period 1860 . outside the music is heard in a fox trot , [female] is seated on the lounge and on her left is [female] . a vapid youth of about twenty-four , he is obviously very unhappy .
the weather being cool and the wind not too high , it would be well to seize this opportunity for the valley of the tombs of the kings . an expedition trying in heat or sand storms . tomorrow also would be devoted to the west , and our third day would belong to luxor and karnak . as a bonne bouche , i dangled the adventure of the temple of [male] . to sweeten the temper of grumblers : but there were no grumblers .
she scorned to trouble his lofty nature with her small annoyances . neither could they long keep down the wellspring of her own [female] . which , deeper than anger could reach , soon began to rise again fresh in her spirit . fed from that water of life which underlies all care . in a few moments it had cooled her cheek .
and when he awoke , he was lying in his own secret chamber . but beside him was a drawing such as the craftsmen make of the work they have imagined in their hearts . and it was the palace of the tomb . henceforward , how should he waver ? he was as a slave who obeys his master . and with haste he summoned to agra his army of beauty .
mrs [organization] had not been able to catch any word of farewell . temporary or otherwise , between her tenants at the door above , they might have quarrelled . or mr [male] might still be asleep , for he was not an early riser . she went into the back room , which was more especially her own apartment . and continued her sewing there , the lady lodger did not return , nor did the gentleman ring his bell .
`` may i tell you something about him ? '' as she asked the question she was standing very close to him . leaning upon his arm , with her left hand crossed upon her right . had others been there , of course she would not have stood in such a guise . she knew that , -- and he knew it too .
that was better than any oration , for it set them all to laughing . and [female] was floated to the sofa on a gentle wave of merriment . once there , everyone but rose and aunt plenty was ordered off by [female] . who was in command now and seemed to have sunk the poet in the physician . the house must be perfectly quiet , and he must go to sleep as soon as possible after the journey .
marion had heard that his brother was engaged conditionally to some `` proud , beauty heiress '' of [location] , and was not at all displeased to have him renounce all claim to his promised bride . when he found to his astonishment that it was his own may [male] . whom cunningham confessed it would have been no difficult thing to love . `` only to think of may [male] marrying a fireman , '' exclaimed hal delancey .
so early next morning came a very polite note ; and it was proposed that [female] should ride the doctor 's horse . and act as escort to miss [female] . who was to go on horseback likewise , no proposal could have been more agreeable to [female] . who adored horses , and seldom had the chance to mount one ; so every one was pleased . and mrs. [female] preened her ancestral feathers with great satisfaction .
the blood rolled in great purple waves over neck and cheek and brow . and then receded , leaving a strange , almost death like , pallor behind it . the small hands were tightly clasped , with a strange mixture of pain and devotion in the movement . and the white lips moved for a moment , forming words that met no mortal ear . then the sweet , low , tender voice sounded again .
the former target was now removed , and a fresh one of the same size placed in its room . hubert , who , as [male] in the first trial of skill . had the right to shoot first , took his aim with great deliberation . long measuring the distance with his eye , while he held in his hand his bended bow . with the arrow placed on the string , at length he made a step forward .
greatly to my relief , sir [male] sent an apology for not joining [male] at breakfast . he had taken an early cup of coffee in his own room . and he was still engaged there in writing letters , at eleven o'clock . if that hour was convenient , he would do himself the honour of waiting on miss [female] and miss [female] . my eyes were on [female] 's face while the message was being delivered .
it was a simple question enough ; but lady [female] 's speaking at all to molly had become to mrs. [female] almost like shaking a red rag at a bull . it was the one thing sure to put her out of temper . but she would not have shown this to lady [female] for the world . only she contrived to baffle any endeavours at further conversation between the two . by placing herself between lady [female] and molly .
d'artagnan and his friends immediately resumed their parts . the governor , suspicious and hard , behaved towards [male] with a politeness almost amounting to obsequiousness . with respect to the travelers , he contented himself with offering good cheer . and never taking his eye from them , [male] and [male] observed that he often tried to embarrass them by sudden attacks . or to catch them off their guard ; but neither the one nor the other gave him the least advantage .
and yet at that very moment the impracticability to which poor [male] 's suit had been reduced was touching [male] 's heart to a warmer sentiment on his behalf than she had felt for years concerning him . he , meanwhile , was sitting down alone in the old familiar house which had ceased to be his . taking a calm if somewhat dismal survey of affairs . the pendulum of the clock bumped every now and then against one side of the case in which it swung . as the muffled drum to his worldly march , looking out of the window he could perceive that a paralysis had come over [male] 's occupation of manuring the garden .
i then narrated the details of my departure from the earth . explaining that my body there lay fully clothed in all the , to her , strange garments of mundane dwellers . at this point sola returned with our meager belongings and her young martian protege . who , of course , would have to share the quarters with them . sola asked [female] if we had had a visitor during her absence .
he did not follow her , and she stood with her back to him . staring at a bowl of carnations on a little table strewn with books . her tears magnified everything she looked at . and the streaked petals of the carnations , their fringed edges and frail curled stamens . pressed upon her , huge and vivid , she noticed among the books a volume of verse he had sent her from england .
farmer oak went towards the plantation and pushed through its lower boughs to the windy side . a dim mass under the slope reminded him that a shed occupied a place here . the site being a cutting into the slope of the hill . so that at its back part the roof was almost level with the ground . in front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered with tar as a preservative .
a few moments later [female] was in her presence . what was said or done during the half hour that passed between his entrance and the moment that brought them side by side from the room need not be told . that the interview had had its serious side was plain , the troubled , anxious eyes of the girl and the rebellious . dogged air of the man told of a conflict now only in abeyance . `` i will never give you up , '' he said .
must face the fire of the defenders , who could also see and protect themselves against any one mounting the wall to pass over the scattered debris of the ruined signal tower . thus every contingency was provided for , as well as might be by five men . against three times their number ; and the europeans meant to make a stubborn fight before that last resort , the dining room . nevertheless , it occurred to [male] that perhaps , after all , he need not greatly repent the confession of love he had made to victoria . he had had no right to speak , but if there were to be no future for either in this world .
`` had you ? '' cried he , catching the same tone . `` i honour you , '' and there was silence between them for a little while . [male] could not immediately fall into a quotation again , the sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by . unless some tender sonnet , fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year . with declining happiness , and the images of youth and hope .
in a moment he followed her . and by this time she had brushed her tears away . but when she turned round her face was pale and the expression of her eyes strange . that reason that i would not tell you . i will tell it you after all , it 's that i can not escape my fate .
the next time [organization] came my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court . she had never spoken a word to her sister in law for three days . but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining . and we found it a great comfort . [organization] had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on miss [female] , i knew .
the prospect before mr. [male] for the next three months was certainly very sad . he was to travel from broughton tolouis . and possibly from thence down into the wilds of [location] . in company with this man , whom he thoroughly despised . nothing could be more abominable to him than such an association .
my heart almost died within me ; miserable longings strained its chords . how long were the september days , how silent , how lifeless , how vast and void seemed the desolate premises ! how gloomy the forsaken garden -- grey now with the dust of a town summer departed . looking forward at the commencement of those eight weeks , i hardly knew how i was to live to the end . my spirits had long been gradually sinking ; now that the prop of employment was withdrawn .
while awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale . however , [female] , even then at the springs , where there were so many people ill and unhappy . readily found a chance for practicing her new principles in imitation of varenka . at first the princess noticed nothing but that [female] was much under the influence of her engouement . as she called it , for madame stahl .
`` a place in the household of the king . '' and he , hearing that the waiting slave of his chief favorite jayashri was dead . gave her that place , so the princess attended on those ladies . courteous and obedient to all authority as beseemed her royalty . and she braided her bright hair so that it hid the little crowns which the princesses of her house must wear always in token of their rank .
when [male] and [male] reached home . they were greeted kindly by both their parents and uncle . the latter had resolved to watch them closely , in order to ascertain . if possible , the reason of his brother 's evident preference for [male] . during the morning nothing was said of the projected visit to new orleans .
if only [organization] and he had met on some desert island without a past . and nature for their house , jon had still his high regard for desert islands . where breadfruit grew , and the water was blue above the coral . the night was deep , was free -- there was enticement in it . a lure , a promise , a refuge from entanglement , and love !
molly was taken to another room ; the maid who conducted her to it told her that mrs. [female] had not wished her to have her nights [female] . as they might very probably have been if she had been in her former sleeping room . in the afternoon mrs. [female] sent for her . and with the want of reticence common to invalids , especially to those suffering from long and depressing maladies . she told molly of the family distress and disappointment .
now , this woman was a widow , and it came to be his duty to tell her that she was so . what if she should claim from him now the love which he had so often proffered to her ! it was not that he feared that she would claim anything from him at this moment . neither now , nor tomorrow , nor the next day , -- but the agony of the present meeting would produce others in which there would be some tenderness mixed with the agony . and so from one meeting to another the thing would progress , dalrymple knew well enough how such things might progress .
far from her intention , her words were maddening me . driving me on , i could not play the coward before her eyes . `` here goes , '' i said , backing water with one oar and running the bow ashore . i stepped out and advanced valiantly upon a long maned bull in the midst of his wives . i was armed with the regular club with which the boat pullers killed the wounded seals gaffed aboard by the hunters .
i took this opportunity to satisfy my curiosity . pretending that i had been robbed in the dunstable coach , and that i would go to see the two highwaymen . but when i came into the press yard , i so disguised myself , and muffled my face up so . that he could see little of me , and consequently knew nothing of who i was . and when i came back , i said publicly that i knew them very well .
`` look sharp , my girl , '' the old man shouted after her . good humoredly , and he went up to levin , well , sir , are you going to nikolay ivanovitch sviazhsky ? his honor comes to [male] too , he began . chatting , leaning his elbows on the railing of the steps . in the middle of the old man 's account of his acquaintance with sviazhsky .
how nice it all was , then she recalled the thin , terribly thin figure of petrov . with his long neck , in his brown coat , his scant . curly hair , his questioning blue eyes that were so terrible to [male] at first . and his painful attempts to seem hearty and lively in her presence . she recalled the efforts she had made at first to overcome the repugnance she felt for him .
so this good , well meaning [female] strode away , proud on the whole of his night 's work . leaving [male] to frown up at the moon with teeth clenched tight upon his pipe stem . now in this life of ours , there be games of many . and divers , sorts , and all are calculated to try the nerve . courage , or skill of the player .
as the cold , bleak spring came on , and consequently as trade continued dead . other mills shortened hours , turned off hands . and finally stopped work altogether , [male] worked short hours . [male] , of course , being a hand in carsons factory , had no work at all , but his son .
if mr. [male] did not begin seriously , he was obliged to proceed so , for his proposal was caught at with delight . and the `` oh , i should like it of all things , '' was not plainer in words than manner , donwell was famous for its strawberry beds . which seemed a plea for the invitation : but no plea was necessary . cabbage beds would have been enough to tempt the lady , who only wanted to be going somewhere .
it was an expectant little group that stood by to witness this greenhorn 's rise and fall . according to his established methods , [male] would allow him to mount . still standing with that indifferent droop to his head , but one who was sharp would observe that he was rolling his old white eyes back to see . tipping his sharp ear like a wildcat to hear every scrape and creak of the leather . then , with the man in the saddle , nobody knew what he would do .
that was her first feeling after reading [female] 's letter . then she read it again , and , forgetting herself . was amused at its likeness to [female] 's self . and was laughing merrily over it when mrs. [female] came into the drawing room . leaning on [female] 's arm , [female] flew to adjust the pillows .
he was a young man , of a handsome person . and was , what his neighbours called , `` a man of spirit . '' he was an excellent fox hunter , and as excellent a companion over his bottle at the end of the chace . he was prodigal of his fortune . where his pleasures were concerned , and as those pleasures were chiefly social , his sporting companions and his mistresses ( for these were also of the plural number ) .
she got through her lessons as well as she could . and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment . she was a great favorite with her mates . being good tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort , her little airs and graces were much admired . so were her accomplishments , for besides her drawing .
the building by which they stood was the market house . it was the only place available ; and they entered . the market being over , and the stalls and areas empty . he would have preferred a more congenial spot , but , as usually happens , in place of a romantic field or solemn aisle for his tale . it was told while they walked up and down over a floor littered with rotten cabbage leaves .
now wishing to save my [female] 's comfort , and to keep things quiet . i shouted out that dinner was ready , so that half the parish could hear me . upon which my mother laughed , and chid me , and despatched her guests before her . and a very good dinner we made , i remember , and a very happy one . attending to the women first , as now is the manner of eating .
he had come prepared to surprise and bully rag the most astute police detective of whom he had any knowledge . he found himself surprised and discountenanced by this ... , confusion no less intense informed the girl 's expression . her eyes were fixed to his with a look of blank enquiry . her face , whose colouring had won his admiration two hours since , was colourless . her lips were just ajar ; the fingers of one hand touched her cheek , indenting it .
i looked again at rupert , now his face was easier . there was a slight smile on his lips ; he flung back his comely head and rested thus against the wainscoting . his eyes asked a question of [organization] . i turned my gaze to where the answer was to come . for rudolf made none in words .
so down she sat , and down sat he , the fire dancing in their faces . and upon the old furniture , that formed oak 's array of household possessions . which sent back a dancing reflection in reply . it was very odd to these two persons , who knew each other passing well . that the mere circumstance of their meeting in a new place and in a new way should make them so awkward and constrained .
clennam wondered within himself , as they took the nearest way to the park . what this unknown could have been doing , his appearance did not at all justify the suspicion that he had been detected in designs on mr [male] 's pocket handkerchief . nor had he any appearance of being quarrelsome or violent , he was a quiet . plain , steady man ; made no attempt to escape . and seemed a little depressed , but neither ashamed nor repentant , if he were a criminal offender .
on the first occasion , she asked me if i knew what medicine oscar was taking . i pleaded ignorance , and passed at once to other matters . on the second occasion , she advanced still further on the way to discovery of the truth . she now inquired if i had heard how the physic worked the cure . having been already informed that the fits proceeded from a certain disordered condition of the brain .
mr. [male] stayed with his friend about an hour after this . but [male] was not in a communicative mood to night , and the talk lagged wearily . it was almost a relief to [male] when they had bidden each other good night . and he was out in the noisy streets once more , making his way towards queen [female] 's court . [female] found [male] worse .
these were charming feelings -- but not lasting , before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for [female] . or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors . than saying to mr. [male] , `` she certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! '' [female] had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt . and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state , former provocations reappeared .
[female] was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her departure . she wrote notes to her [location] acquaintances . put down her accounts , and packed , altogether [female] fancied she was not in a placid state of mind . but in that worried mood , which [female] knew well with herself . and which does not come without cause , and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with self .
well , it is always a good plan to follow up an advantage promptly . the knights were temporarily down , but if i would keep them so i must just simply paralyze them . nothing short of that would answer , you see , i was `` bluffing '' that last time in the field . it would be natural for them to work around to that conclusion . if i gave them a chance , so i must not give them time .
`` god pity me ! '' she moaned , and sat huddled there , shaken with sobs , [male] started at that heart broken cry . cowering , he approached her . and [female] , grim and sardonic , stood back , a spectator of the scene he had precipitated . he knew that given rope [male] would enmesh himself still further .
helen was not only tall and lithe , but her movements were marked by a quiet elegance . it was her custom . in nearly all weathers , to walk from bayswater to professor [female] study . which , needless to say , was situated near the british museum , she usually returned by a longer route . unless pelting rain or the misery of [location] snow made the streets intolerable .
only count orlov denisov with his cossacks got to his appointed place at the right time . this detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest . on the path leading from the village of [organization] to dmitrovsk . toward dawn , count orlov denisov , who had dozed off , was awakened by a deserter from the french army being brought to him . this was a polish sergeant of poniatowski 's corps .
he put his arm round my waist and bade me hold fast to his shoulder . i obeyed , and directly found myself carried along in a swift , delightful movement . which seemed to my drowsy , deadened senses , quick as the nimble air . smooth as a swallow 's flight , he was a consummate master in the art of skating . that was evident , a strong , unfailing arm held me fast , i felt no sense of danger .
as it was , the hopeless , foolish tears rose up to her large eyes . and made them liquid and soft ; and when they rose . [female] oglethorpe saw them . such beautiful eyes as they were ; such ignorant . believing , fawn like eyes , the eyes alone would have unmanned him .
and then when she spoke , , , what chance was there for poor [male] ? he was undone , all scrap said was , `` how do you do , '' on mr. [male] presenting him . but it was enough ; it undid [male] . from a cheerful , chatty , happy young man .
`` many a danger have you gone through , fair gentle friend , '' said the king to him ; now tarry in this country at my court . as you are wont to do , '' `` sire , since you wish it . i shall remain very gladly three or four years entire , but ask guivret to remain here too a request in which i would fain join . the king prays him to remain , and he consents to stay .
we , men , are knights whose [female] is that freedom to which our ideals call us . she who makes for [female] the banner under which we fare forth is the true woman for us . we must tear away the disguise of her who weaves our net of enchantment at home . and know her for what she is , we must beware of clothing her in the witchery of our own longings and imaginings . and thus allow her to distract [female] from our true [female] .
coppenole , from his post , ordered all , directed all , arranged all , during the uproar . the cardinal , no less abashed than gringoire , had retired with all his suite . under the pretext of business and vespers . without the crowd which his arrival had so deeply stirred being in the least moved by his departure . [male] rym was the only one who noticed his eminence 's discomfiture .
equally , if his heart had given entertainment to that prohibited guest . his silent fighting of his way through the mental condition of this period might have been a little meritorious . in the constant effort not to be betrayed into a new phase of the besetting sin of his experience . the pursuit of selfish objects by low and small means . and to hold instead to some high principle of honour and generosity .
we passed down the passage , crossed the great aisle like cave . and came to the corresponding passage on the other side , at the mouth of which the guards stood like two statues . as we came they bowed their heads in salutation . and then lifting their long spears placed them transversely across their foreheads . as the leaders of the troop that had met [female] had done with their ivory wands .
as he stood there admiring it all with roving eyes . he was startled after a moment by the sudden , and as it seemed to him unannounced apparition of a man in a well-made grey tweed suit . just a yard or two in front of him . he was aware of an intruder , to be sure , there was nothing very remarkable at first sight either in the stranger 's dress . appearance , or manner , all that [male] noticed for himself in the newcomer 's mien for the first few seconds was a certain distinct air of social superiority .
on the verge of the horizon a flight of birds of passage formed a long dark line against the sky . they were flying fast as if alarmed , he raised it as high as he could . as high , indeed , as the curving of the rocks would permit , towards noon the sun appeared to him to give more than its usual warmth . noon is the critical time of the day . standing upon the powerful frame which he had built up , he paused again to survey the wide expanse .
the duke and duchess with their children and personal servants reached gatherum castle the day before the first crowd of visitors was expected . it was on a lovely autumn afternoon . and the duke , who had endeavoured to make himself [male] during the journey . had suggested that as soon as the heat would allow them they would saunter about the grounds and see what was being done . they could dine late , at half past eight or nine , so that they might be walking from seven to eight .
though reuben and his wife ruled on social points . religious questions were mostly disposed of by the old man , whose firmness on this head quite counterbalanced a certain weakness in his handling of domestic matters . the hopes of the younger members of the household were therefore relegated to a distance of one hour and three quarters . a result that took visible shape in them by a remote and listless look about the eyes . the singing of songs being permitted in the interim .
this letter being folded , was delivered to the squire , and by him to the messenger who waited without . as the answer to that which he had brought , the yeoman having thus accomplished his mission . returned to the head quarters of the allies , which were for the present established under a venerable oak tree . about three arrow flights distant from the castle , here wamba and gurth . with their allies the [male] knight and locksley .
his voice rose and fell amidst the music and the singing of tristan and king mark . like a voice heard in a badly connected telephone . she stared at his pleading face , she turned to the stage . and tristan was wounded in kurvenal 's arms . with isolde at his feet , and king mark .
this letter he himself took up to town on the following day . and there posted , addressing it to [male] hall . he did not expect very great results from it . as he read it over , he was painfully aware that all his trash about caravels and cargoes of sulphur would not go far with mr. [male] . but it might go farther than nothing , he was bound not to neglect mr. [male] 's letter to him .
and [female] felt herself rebuked , as [female] had done . but to be rebuked in this way by [female] made her rather proud . a dove like note of melancholy in this speech caused mrs. [female] to look at [female] with new examination . after laying down her hat and pushing her curls flat , with an air of fatigue . she placed herself on a chair opposite her friend in her habitual attitude .
his wife knew and she made no sign . glennard found himself in the case of the seafarer who . closing his eyes at nightfall on a scene he thinks to put leagues behind him before day . wakes to a port hole framing the same patch of shore . from the kind of exaltation to which his resolve had lifted him he dropped to an unreasoning apathy .
in another way also there had been a close alliance between them . and one not always of a very [male] description , the doctor was . and long had been , sir [male] 's medical attendant , and , in his unceasing attempts to rescue the drunkard from the fate which was so much to be dreaded . he not unfrequently was driven into a quarrel with his patient . one thing further must be told of sir [male] .
[female] face had become suffused with blushes at the first mention of the friend and the gig . but then [female] blushed very easily , [female] knew all about it at once . at once divined who must be the friend in the gig , and was almost beside herself with joy . lady [female] , who had heard no more of the [female] than had [female] . was still clever enough to perceive that the friend must be a particular friend , -- for she had noticed miss [female] 's blushes .
instead of circling back around the city to the northwest and toward the nearest waterway which lay so short a distance from us . we turned to the northeast and struck out upon the mossy waste across which . for two hundred dangerous and weary miles , lay another main artery leading to helium . no word was spoken until we had left the city far behind . but i could hear the quiet sobbing of dejah thoris as she clung to me with her dear head resting against my shoulder .
under that gaze my heart fell , in former days there had been in his face something not unakin to this stormy free night . but now it was changed -- how changed , a year had wrought a terrible alteration . i knew not his past ; but i did know that he had long been struggling . and a dread fear seized me that the struggle was growing too hard for him . his spirit was breaking , it was not only that the shadows were broader .
had only to discover the whereabouts of [male] ; a matter of no great difficulty . [male] imagined , since it was most likely that [male] 's father had frequent personal communication with the lawyer . nor was it improbable that he would have business with his agent or representative . mr. [female] , in queen [female] 's court . provided with these two addresses , [male] fancied that mr. [female] 's work must needs be easy enough .
d'artagnan and [male] obeyed . the court of [male] of [male] was full of gayety and animation . for , after having gained a victory over the spaniard , it had just gained another over the people . broussel had been conducted out of [location] without further resistance . and was at this time in the prison of saint [male] .
at this instant the squadron , that ought to have protected [female] 's retreat . was advancing to meet the english regiments , the king , who was entirely surrounded . walked alone in a great empty space , he appeared calm . but it was evidently not without a mighty effort . drops of perspiration trickled down his face .
it seemed to him impossible that a man who had been so terror stricken as he had fancied andre louis . could have recovered his wits so quickly and completely , yet the doubt remained , to resolve it after the curtain had fallen upon a first act that had gone with a verve unrivalled until this hour in the annals of the company . borne almost entirely upon the slim shoulders of the new scaramouche . [male] binet bluntly questioned him . they were standing in the space that did duty as green room .
of course clover wanted to , she finished her dressing at top speed . hurried on her hat and jacket , stole softly out to where the others awaited her . and in five minutes they were smoothly running down the gorge . over high trestle work bridges and round sharp curves which made her draw her breath a little faster . there was no danger , the men who managed the hand car assured them .
and they parted company , mr. [male] hurried to his warehouse . and , sternly forbidding his clerks to allow any one to interrupt him , he went his way to his own private room . and locked the door , then he indulged himself in the torture of thinking it all over . and realising every detail , how could he have lulled himself into the unsuspicious calm in which her tearful image had mirrored itself not two hours before . till he had weakly pitied her and yearned towards her .
the justice then heard the mercer and his man . the mercer indeed made a long harangue of the great loss they have daily by lifters and thieves . that it was easy for them to mistake , and that when he found it he would have dismissed me . etc. , as above , as to the journeyman , he had very little to say . but that he pretended other of the servants told him that i was really the person .
mrs. [female] was most zealous in promoting the match , by every suggestion and contrivance likely to enhance its desirableness to either party . and , among other means , by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman 's mother . who at present lived with him , and to whom she even forced lady bertram to go through ten miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit . it was not long before a good understanding took place between this lady and herself . mrs. [female] acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry .
ooh , but how she hated the infant crying in the night . she would murder it gladly , she would stifle it and bury it . as hetty sorrell did , no doubt hetty sorrell 's infant cried in the night . no doubt [female] donnithorne 's infant would . ha -- the [female] donnithornes , the geralds of this world .
the group closed in on them and for the first time in his life [male] realized the insuperable inconvenience of being passionately detested . he gazed around helplessly at the glowering , violently hostile faces , he towered a head taller than his roommate . so if he hit back he would be called a bully and have half a dozen more fights on his hands within five minutes . yet if he did not he was a coward . for a moment he stood there facing gilly 's blazing eyes .
and when it was told the king and the queen of such a knight that was such an harper . anon the king sent for him . and let search his wounds , and then asked him his name . then he answered , i am of the country of liones . and my name is tramtrist , that thus was wounded in a battle as i fought for a lady 's right .
this darkness and silence alarmed [female] still more than [female] 's absence had done . almost mad with grief , and determined to venture everything in order to see [male] once more . and be certain of the misfortune he feared , [male] gained the edge of the clump of trees . and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower garden , when the sound of a voice . still at some distance , but which was borne upon the wind , reached him .
he turned his face toward the far shore . where the wilderness seemed to reach off into eternity , what a glory it was . the green seas of spruce and cedar and [male] . the ridges of poplar and birch rising like silvery spume above the darker billows . and afar off , mellowed in the sun mists , the guardian crests of trout mountains sentineling the country beyond !
he got his hat and went out , and down the stairs again . wilkins had disappeared , but bill still stood by the entrance . watching the crowd that drifted in and out , in his state of tension he felt that the hotel clerk 's eyes were suspicious as he retained the two rooms for another day . and that bill watched him out with more than casual interest . even the matter of cancelling the order for the car loomed large and suspicion breeding before him .
admiration for [female] would have made susy suffer them gladly . she even began to be aware of a growing liking for them . a liking inspired by the very characteristics that would once have provoked her disapproval . susy had had plenty of training in liking common people with big purses . in such cases her stock of allowances and extenuations was inexhaustible .
the wind howled down from the northern ice , and the broken walls rose up against it . brooding , gigantic , roofless now but so huge and sprawling that they seemed less like walls than cliffs of ebon stone . stark would not have gone near them but for camar . they were wrong , somehow , with a taint of forgotten evil still about them . the big earthman glanced at camar , and his face was sad .
so they sat under a tree to watch until in the clean pool formed they could see little fish gathering . then the boys lay on the banks and tried to catch them with their hands . and succeeded in getting a few , mr. [male] suggested they should make pools . one on each side of the creek , for their fish . so they eagerly went to work , they pushed and slapped each other , they fought over the same stone .
sammy told of her visit to their friends at the matthews place . and of the stranger who had come into the neighborhood , as the girl talked . her father questioned her carefully , and several times the metallic note crept into his soft . drawling speech , while into his eyes came that peculiar . searching look , as if he would draw from his daughter even more than she knew of the incident .
all the earth grows fire , white lips of desire brushing cool on the forehead . croon slumbrous things , earth fades . and the air is thrilled with ways , dewy paths full of comfort . and radiant bands , the gracious presence of friendly hands . help the blind one , the glad one , who stumbles and strays .
he then , touched with compassion , granted an asylum to innocence . and hospitality to misfortune , he filled her lap with plenty . and , leading her towards [male] as before the elders of the city . declared his purpose to take her in marriage , at this scene . madame [female] tour .
`` i have eaten in worse places , '' he said . smiling at her , `` and sometimes not at all , '' he was immediately sorry for that . for the tears came to her eyes , he broke as gently as he could the news that he could not stay . but it was a great blow to her , her sagging chin quivered piteously . and it took all the cheerfulness he could summon and all the promises of return he could make to soften the shock .
there was a melancholy in his tone which touched his daughter deeply . he seemed to have struck the key note of his life in those few words . a disappointed unsuccessful life ; a youth in which there had been some hidden cause for the ungenial temper of his middle age . father and daughter dined together very pleasantly , clarissa had been almost happy by her father 's unwonted tenderness . and mr. [male] was in tolerable spirits , in spite of that dreary afternoon 's labour .
with a proud air she crushingly departed , returning to her own home far from dissatisfied with what she had accomplished . moreover , she began to expand with the realization of a new importance . and she was gratified with the effect upon her parents . at dinner that evening , when she informed them that she had written a poem . which was to be published in the prospective first number of the north end daily oriole .
they were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were mightily relieved . at last , when old [male] swept the difficulty away for them with a common sense hint . he asked them why they were so dull . why did not it occur to them to strip me . in half a minute i was as naked as a pair of tongs !
matters were about as i expected to find them . the `` fountain '' was an ordinary well , it had been dug in the ordinary way . and stoned up in the ordinary way , there was no miracle about it . even the lie that had created its reputation was not miraculous ; i could have told it myself . with one hand tied behind me , the well was in a dark chamber which stood in the center of a cut stone chapel .
when i was a small chap like you . i used to read about him , then the atom yielded entirely , and leaned comfortably against [male] . and his sister left them , carrying the candle with her . old sally threw another log on the fire , and the flames leaped up the cavernous chimney . lighting the room with dramatic splendor , thryng took note of its unique furnishing .
mr [male] was going to say , my benefactor . and had said my bene , when a grandiloquent change came over him . thrown on the wide world , doom would to wander and roam , bereft of my parents . bereft of a home , a stranger to something and what 's his name joy . behold little [male] the poor peasant boy .
and now [male] vavasor vanishes from our pages . and will be heard of no more , roebury knew him no longer , nor pall mall . nor the chelsea districts , his disappearance was a nine days wonder , but the world at large knew nothing of the circumstances of that attempt in suffolk street . mr grey himself told the story to no one .
[female] 's voice was low and tense . it held a masterful note i had never heard . without realizing that i did so , i obeyed him , and lifted my eyes to his . what i read in them made me tremble , this was a new [male] facing me across the table . the cousin brother , my best friend since my childhood , was gone .
mystery still hung over the house of eben tollman an hour or two later . but the two figures that had sat with the quietness of unaccomplished death were again sensate and restored to full consciousness . conscience had been able to go to her own room , and stuart . now dressed , came slowly and as yet somewhat haltingly down the stairs , holding carefully to the rail . he was setting out to search for eben tollman , and to call in medical help .
the cause of this rapid change soon appeared , a [male] . handsome man , between fifty and sixty . came through the little gate leading to the park , and , seeing the young stranger . paused to examine her , he had only time for a glance , however . she seemed conscious of his presence in a moment .
but it was necessary to say something , and , fortifying myself with the good old spanish notion that lies told to the heathen are not recorded . i related that a venomous serpent had bitten me ; after which a terrible thunderstorm had surprised me in the forest . and night coming on prevented my escape from it . then , next day , remembering that he who is bitten by a serpent dies . and not wishing to distress my friends with the sight of my dissolution .
sobriety , however , can only count as a virtue when there are other virtues to support it . in any case , as a marcou , [male] had it in his power to render great services . on a certain good friday , at midnight , a day and an hour propitious to this kind of cure . all the scrofulous people of the island , either by sudden inspiration . or by concerted action , presented themselves in a crowd at the bû [male] rue .
she nodded with her head to the window . he went to it and looked out , it was the little walled garden on which he looked . in which , if he had but known it , the lad whom he liked had kissed the maid whom he loved . and there walked the maid , at this moment with her back to him . going up the central path that was bordered with box , the february sun shone on her as she went .
professionally -- it was different when crazy steerage passengers jumped overboard -- professionally , mcphee does not approve of saving life at sea . and he has often told me that a new hell awaits stokers and trimmers who sign for a strong man 's pay and fall sick the second day out . he believes in throwing boots at fourth and fifth engineers when they wake him up at night with word that a bearing is redhot . all because a lamp 's glare is reflected red from the twirling metal . he believes that there are only two poets in the world .
the two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary . lazariste ladies , like all sisters of charity . bore the names of sister perpetue and sister simplice . sister perpetue was an ordinary villager . a sister of charity in a coarse style .
she found him preparing himself for his visit to the cathedral . some year or two , -- but no more , -- before the date of which we are speaking . he had still taken some small part in the service . and while he had done so he had of course worn his surplice . living so close to the cathedral , -- so close that he could almost walk out of the house into the transept .
he stopped , for two reasons , i was weeping as i returned it to him . and the train rolled into the [male] station . on my way to [male] 's , i made up my mind what to do . i should not speak to [male] , nor to any one else of what had happened . but i should write very soon to my parents and tell them the truth .
and while i wondered what he meant , he called to some of the people in waiting at the farther end of the room . and they brought him a little sword . such as annie would skewer a turkey with , then he signified to me to kneel . which i did ( after dusting the board , for the sake of my best breeches ) . and then he gave me a little tap very nicely upon my shoulder .
found miss [female] vastly improved by her engagement , she was much more accessible . much more free and engaging , much less exacting ; insomuch that she now entertained a host of followers and admirers . to the bitter indignation of ladies with daughters to marry . who were to be regarded as having revolted from society on the miss [female] grievance . and erected a rebellious standard , enjoying the flutter she caused .
in this emergency the first necessity , as mrs. [female] knew by experience . was to endeavour to quiet [female] 's anxiety of mind . and for this purpose the good woman went herself the next day to the lake . to try if she could find lady [female] ( who would be sure , as [female] said . to take her daily walk to the boat house ) , and prevail on her to come back privately to the cottage near sandon .
my two experts arrived in the evening , and pretty well fagged , for they had traveled double tides . they had pack mules along , and had brought everything i needed . tools , pump , lead pipe . greek fire , sheaves of big rockets . roman candles , colored fire sprays .
but the wish did not live long , suddenly her face , her eyes . came before him in the night , he heard her say that she would give him `` half her star , '' and his heart grew sick with longing , before dawn they were called . and started as the sun showed over the horizon , so they ran into the western country . near to the [location] border , dull at first .
she trusted her ; she felt a respect for her . the first step of confidence was comparatively simple ; but a further confidence had revealed itself . as [location] spoke , which was not so simple , and yet it impressed itself upon her as a necessity . she must tell [location] what it was clear that she had no conception of . she must tell [location] that [female] was in love with her .
nothing gives a man such spirit for a fight . as the act of fighting , during these election days he was almost regardless of [male] . he was to second the nomination of the jew . and so keen was he as to the speech that he would make . and as to the success of what he was doing against mr. [male] .
as for poor [male] , every one knows his bitter adventures , when his pardon was recalled . because of his journey to sedgemoor , not a child in the country . i doubt , but knows far more than i do of [male] 's most desperate doings . the law had ruined him once , he said . and then he had been too much for the law : and now that a quiet life was his object .
the changes of a fevered room are slow and fluctuating . but the changes of the fevered world are rapid and irrevocable , on the first crash of the eminent mr [male] 's decease . many important persons had been unable to determine whether they should cut mrs [female] . or comfort her , as it seemed , however , essential to the strength of their own case that they should admit her to have been cruelly deceived . they graciously made the admission , and continued to know her .
nor was it relieved by any glimpse of the little creature who had brought him there . perhaps she glided out of her doorway and in at that where her father lived . while his face was turned from both ; but he saw nothing of her . it was too early for her brother ; to have seen him once . was to have seen enough of him to know that he would be sluggish to leave whatever frowsy bed he occupied at night .
hardly knowing what i did , i opened the door . why had i not done so before ? i do not know , at first i could see no one . but when i had forced myself past the tree which grew across the entrance . i saw , seated on the ground , and leaning against the tree . with her back to my prison , a beautiful woman .
in an instant [female] was charged on the book with three dollar and a half . although his work that day had earned him less than a dollar . on his way back to the men 's shanty he could not help thinking how easy it would be for him to leave the next morning two dollar and a half ahead . he wondered if this method of procedure obtained in all the camps . the newcomer 's first day of hard work had tired him completely .
`` do you know them ? '' [female] asked of [female] . turning to her with faint challenge , [female] readjusted herself a little . she had been ready to accept [female] as a sort of servant . now she saw it was on terms of friendship they were intended to meet . she was rather glad , she had so many half inferiors .
she had been disconcerted , as i have mentioned , but i had already perceived and i was to observe again that when miss tita was embarrassed she did not turn away from you and try to escape . but came closer , as it were , with a deprecating , clinging appeal to be spared . to be protected , her attitude was perpetually a sort of prayer for assistance , for explanation . and yet no woman in the world could have been less of a comedian , from the moment you were kind to her she depended on you absolutely . her self consciousness dropped from her and she took the greatest intimacy .
but at last , love , willing to make him as amorous as he was valiant . presented him with the sight of [male] . whose admirable beauty so inveigled the eye of [male] . that forgetting himself , he stood and fed his looks on the favor of [female] 's face . which she perceiving blushed , which was such a doubling of her beauteous excellence .
for a moment they stood still and i saw the girl had on low shoes and a shabby coat which had once been showy . on one side of her hat was a red bird . battered and bruised , and at this comic effort at dressiness , which poor people cling to with such pathetic persistence . i smiled , and then in alarm leaned closer to the window . they had begun their walk again , and were now at the end of the path opening on to the pavement .
he dismounted from the chaise , and telling the driver - even that was not easy in his agitation - to remain behind for a few minutes . and then to follow slowly , ran on with exceeding swiftness , tried the gate . scaled the wall , jumped down on the other side , and stood panting in the old orchard . there was a frosty rime upon the trees , which , in the faint light of the clouded moon .
feversham followed his example , and side by side they went racing down the sand . at the bottom of the row they stopped . shook hands , and with the curtest of nods parted . feversham rode out of the park , durrance turned back and walked his horse up toward the seats beneath the trees . thus , at all events , he argued as he rode .
before the massive old gateway the car drew up , and at the sound of the brakes the oak doors opened . [male] passed in between the two footmen , one of whom relieved him of his coat and hat . whilst the other shot home the great bolts behind him . `` i will want nothing more , '' he said shortly . and crossing the hall entered a room on the left .
`` oh god , '' said [male] within himself . his head was turned askance as he still resolutely regarded the ground . for the last several minutes he had seen this great temptation approaching him in regular siege . and now it had come , the wrong , the social sin , of now taking advantage of the offer of her lips had a magnitude . in the eyes of one whose life had been so primitive , so ruled by purest household laws .
in the meantime , he had bound together with his rawhide thongs several of the oddly shaped pine timbers to form a species of dead fall trap . it was slow work , for thorpe 's knowledge of such things was theoretical . he had learned his theory well , however , and in the end arrived . all this time he had made no effort to look over the pine . nor did he intend to begin until he could be sure of doing so in safety .
wickham , [female] , were all forgotten , [female] was beyond competition her favourite child . at that moment , she cared for no other , her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense . [female] for the use of the library at netherfield . and [female] begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . [female] had now but little time for conversation with her sister .
then the meeting was at an end ; the men went on with stories of the week 's fishing . stories of smugglers , stories of the swaddlers . stories of the totalers , and [male] made for the door . when he got there , he began to reflect that , being in the house . he ought to leave good night with casar and grannie .
a sharp click interrupted me , and i found myself in darkness . i heard the closing of a door , the turning of a lock . when , after a moment 's groping along the wall . i found the electric button and switched on the light again . i saw that the door leading from the library to the hall was closed .
he was too shadowy a mark , besides , he was dead . the whole current of her wrath turned upon the supplanter , this lord dawlish . she pictured him as a crafty adventurer . a wretched fortune hunter , for some reason or other she imagined him a sinister person with a [male] moustache . a face thin and hawk like , and unpleasant eyes , that was the sort of man who would be likely to fasten his talons into poor uncle ira .
it has been said that mere ease after torment is delight for a time . and the countenances of these poor creatures expressed it now . forty nine operations were successfully performed , owing to the great hurry necessitated by the far gone state of some of the flock . [male] missed his aim in one case . and in one only -- striking wide of the mark , and inflicting a mortal blow at once upon the suffering ewe .
but the smile froze when the door opened and he saw the missioner standing there . more than once he had accompanied father layonne over the threshold of life into the presence of death . but he had never before seen in his face what he saw there now , he stared . the missioner remained in the doorway , hesitating , as if at the last moment a great fear held him back . for an interval the eyes of the two men rested upon each other in a silence that was like the grip of a living thing .
two gilt coaches , full of chattering fine ladies and gentlemen . were being driven on a certain day through a part of the town not ordinarily frequented by fashion . but the occupants of the coaches had been entertaining themselves with a great and curious sight it had been their delicate fancy to desire to behold as an exciting novelty . this had been no less an exhibition than the hanging of two malefactors on tyburn hill . the one a handsome young highwayman , the other a poor woman executed for larceny .
i can not help wanting to explain all my conduct to you . and i have written you a letter . but , written by a girl like me , such a letter might seem to be a lie . unless death had sanctified it by its authority . and , instead of a letter , it were a confession .
i have done it , i have done it ! i knew i would do it , no , i did it , forgive me . i had to do it , it is because i love you that i did not want you to say it . only i did , it is because i love you that i went abroad . to stay , only i could not , i could not stay away , [ she holds his face in her hands. ] oh .
why should a place of worship opposite to his gate be considered by him as an injury ? why should the psalm singing of [male] brethren hurt his ears as he walked about his garden ? and if , through the infirmity of his nature , his eyes and his ears were hurt . what was that to the great purport for which he had been sent into the parish ? was he not about to create enmity by his opposition .
this accident was the ruin of [female] 's scheme . her father , always the favourite of circumstance . had by chance struck the first blow ; ignorant of the battle that awaited him . he had unwittingly won it by putting her in the wrong , as titus price had put him in the wrong . she knew in a flash that her enterprise was hopeless .
and now [male] was going to try his luck again , it certainly did seem funny . [male] walked home with prissy from prayer meeting four nights before emmeline found it out . emmeline had not been going to prayer meeting all that summer because she was mad at mr. [male] . she had expressed her disapproval to him because he had buried old [male] at the harbour `` just as if she was a [male] , '' and mr. [female] had said something to her she could not get over for a while .
what a relief to these agonies had it been . could they have seen upton as he once more gained the solitude of his chamber . where , divested of all the restraints of an audience , he walked leisurely up and down . smoking a cigar , and occasionally smiling pleasantly as some `` conceit '' crossed his mind . had there been any one to mark him there , it is more than likely that he would have regarded him as a man revelling in the after thought of a great success .
he forgot her , and turned to look at [female] . with head oddly lifted , like a man who draws his head back from an insult . half haughtily , he watched the cold . mute , material face , it had a bluish cast . it sent a shaft like ice through the heart of the living man .
whenever she wants a nosegay he has got one to give her . gathered and arranged by himself , and greatly to my amusement , he is always cunningly provided with a duplicate . composed of exactly the same flowers , grouped in exactly the same way , to appease his icily jealous wife before she can so much as think herself aggrieved . his management of the countess is a sight to see . he bows to her , he habitually addresses her as `` my angel , ''
he was then silent , and slowly she took herself out of the room . and went away to dress , all this was very terrible , he had never been rough to her before . and she could not at all understand why he had been so rough to her now . surely it was impossible that he should be jealous because her old lover had written to her such a letter as that which she had shown him ! and then she was almost stunned by the opinions he had expressed about fletcher .
under the level insistence of his eyes she had fallen back a pace and stood holding the unsupported gown over her bosom . but when he finished with that final announcement , which seemed to her a threat . she sprang forward again and threw her arms about him . not in an embrace but with the instinct of a single idea . to prevent his carrying out his announced intention , stuart attempted gently to disengage himself .
their sole study was how they could please and assist one another . for of all other things they were ignorant , and indeed could neither read nor write . they were never [male] by inquiries about past times . nor did their curiosity extend beyond the bounds of their mountain . they believed the world ended at the shores of their own island .
stanbury had just determined that he must go , that there was no possibility for him either to say or do anything to promote his cause at the present moment . when the circumstances were all changed by the return home of lady rowley and mrs. [female] . lady rowley knew , and had for some days known , much more of [organization] than had come to the ears of sir [male] . she understood in the first place that the stanburys had been very good to her daughter . and she was aware that hugh [organization] had thoroughly taken her daughter 's part against his old friend [female] .
as this short reply indicated that he meant to say no more , no more was asked . and the subject was dropped , in the mean time , rushbrook , happier than he had been for months . intoxicated with joy at that voluntary mark of civility he had received from lady [male] . felt his heart so joyous , and so free from every particle of malice . that he resolved , in the humblest manner , to make atonement for the violation of decorum he had lately committed against mr. [male] .
it was [female] 's delight to tell [female] of her trouble . and to protest to this kind confidante again and again that no persuasion or threats of her father 's should ever induce her to marry [female] . which resolution mrs. [female] fully approved . there was a little gate opening from a broad green lane into one of the fields at the back of the grange . and here sometimes of a summer evening they used to find [male] .
day was breaking , and a great stain of purple colour broadened out in the pale horizon over [location] . the livid river was shivering in the wind ; there was no one on the bridges . the street lamps were going out , she revived . and began thinking of berthe asleep yonder in the servant 's room . then a cart filled with long strips of iron passed by .
he dispraises himself most unnecessarily in denying the prettiness of his language , ', said [female] . as she spoke she hardly moved her lips . and dalrymple went on painting from the model , it was clear that miss van siever understood that the painting . and not the pretty speeches , was the important business on hand . mrs. [female] had now tucked her feet up on the sofa .
he even came to be welcome at sir [male] 's table . for after the dragon 's appearance , the baron grew civil to all members of the church . by day this versatile sinner . the grand marshal , would walk in the sight of the world with staid step . clothed in gray , his hood concealing his fierce , unchurchly eyes .
some of the inhabitants of yonville came out into the square . they all spoke at once , asking for news , for explanations , for hampers . hivert did not know whom to answer , it was he who did the errands of the place in town . he went to the shops and brought back rolls of leather for the shoemaker . old iron for the farrier , a barrel of herrings for his [male] .
now [female] was recovering softly from her fright and faintness . and the volley of the wind from galloping so had made her little ears quite pink . and shaken her locks all round her , but any one who might wish to see a comely sight and a moving one . need only have looked at [female] huckaback , when she learned ( and imagined yet more than it was ) . the manner of her little ride with me .
custom , which made [female] dearer to [female] every day . had by this time familiarised her with his position as her future husband . she was no longer surprised or distressed when he pleaded for a short engagement . and a speedy realization of that utopian home which they were to inhabit together . the knowledge of her uncle 's delight in this engagement of hers might have reconciled her to it .
she desired no provision ; for her , in the discomfiture of heart . there was consolation in the feeling that when she should find herself alone in the world . she would have been ill treated by her friends all round her , there was a charm in the prospect of her desolation of which she did not wish to be robbed by the assurance of some seventy pounds a year . to be given to her by captain [female] , to be robbed of one 's grievance is the last and foulest wrong . a wrong under which the most enduring temper will at last yield and become soured .
she was still young and pretty , and there might come another lover more desirable than yosef mealyus . that the man would have to undergo the punishment of bigamy in its severest form . there was no doubt ; -- but would law , and justice . and the prevailing desire for revenge . be able to get at him in such a way that he might be hung ?
on one occasion aunt [female] had a very narrow escape . and the culprit being her son , not her husband . she felt free to repay herself for many scares of this sort by a good scolding . which , unlike many , produced excellent results , one bright june day . as rose came cantering home from the point on her pretty bay pony .
`` bless the nice people for such grand things , an '' the berries . but never mind about the cow , then mickey took her back to the house . she awoke from a restful nap to find a basket of chickens waiting for her . barely down dry from their shells , she caught up a little yellow ball . and with both hands clutched it , exclaiming and crying in joy until mickey saw the chicken was drooping .
lenoir tried to speak , but his voice came in horrible gurgles , his face was a ghastly greenish hue . lined with purple and swollen veins . his eyes were standing out of his head , and his breath sobbing in raucous gasps . slowly the head went back , the crowd stood in horror stricken silence waiting for the sickening snap . yankee , unable to stand it any longer , stepped up to his chief .
yet , in face of all perplexities , perhaps even the more because of the darkness in which he was enveloped . rudolf held firm to his purpose , there were two things that seemed plain . if rupert had escaped the trap and was still alive with the letter on him . rupert must be found ; here was the first task , that accomplished , there remained for rudolf himself nothing save to disappear as quietly and secretly as he had come . trusting that his presence could be concealed from the man whose name he had usurped .
when a courtesan is able to realize much money every day . by reason of many customers , she should not confine herself to a single lover . under such circumstances , she should fix her rate for one night . after considering the place , the season , and the condition of the people . and having regard to her own good qualities and good looks .
in the left corner of the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together . there -- incredibly naked -- was the beauty lidi , [location] 's wife . there was the lady of the house ; there shone the bald head of [female] . always to be found where the best people were , in that direction gazed the young men . not venturing to approach , there , too , she descried stiva .
it was not far from the rue [female] louvain . and we stood on the doorsteps of the house we sought ere the clouds . severing with loud peal and shattered cataract of lightning . emptied their livid folds in a torrent , heavy , prone , and broad . `` come in , come in , '' said [female] , as , after putting her into the house .
the duke had brought the horse almost back to camp when the animal was taken with an extraordinarily vicious spasm of pitching . broken by sudden efforts to fling himself down and roll over on his persistent rider . the duke let him have it his way . all but the rolling , for a while ; then he appeared to lose patience with the stubborn beast . he headed him into the open , laid the quirt to him .
alone on that little , sea grit isle , trembling beneath the waves that beat upon it . and in the fast gathering darkness he stood for a moment spellbound . all the ghostly tales he had been told of this spot came to him in an instant and with the force of truth . and had he at that moment beheld some spectral figure rise from among the [male] rocks he would not have been surprised . then feeling his strength leaving him , he turned and ran as fast as he could back to where he had built the shelter .
she came straight to me in a moment . just as easily as i could have gone to her myself if i had tried . it was true -- she had blindfolded herself ! with her eyes closed , she could measure to a hair 's breadth the distance which . with her eyes opened , she was perfectly incompetent to calculate , detected by both of us .
half an hour later he was asleep , but not , it must be confessed . in the aristocratic seclusion of his own berth , he was downily curled beside mother . his cheek nuzzled beside her delicate old hand , they changed from steamer to railroad . about eleven in the morning they stepped out at west skipsit , cape cod . uncle [male] and mrs. [female] were driving up .
she stood swaying a moment , looking at [female] . her white face distorted into a mask of unutterable pain . [female] stepped towards her , ready to support her . fearing that she was about to fall , but with an imperious hand she checked his advance . and by a supreme effort controlled her weakness , yet her knees shook under her .
on that occasion , when he left her at the door in arundel street . he had not renewed his offer , on christmas day miss [female] was pressed very hard to eat her christmas dinner with mr and mrs buggins . and she almost gave way , she had some half formed idea in her head that should she once sit down to table with buggins . she would have given up the fight altogether , she had no objection to buggins . and had , indeed , no strong objection to put herself on a par with buggins .
her woman having once more left the room , stopped at the door to listen . but all within remaining silent , she retired to rest , it is probable that maria perpetrated the fatal act soon after the dismission of her woman . for when she was found , two hours afterwards . she appeared to have been dead for some time , on examination a wound was discovered on her left side . which had doubtless penetrated to the heart , from the suddenness of her death .
one man was heard to say to another : do you see that fellow with a red beard . he 's the one who will give the word when we are to fire . it appears that this red beard was present , at another riot . the quenisset affair , entrusted with this same function . the hearse passed the [location] , traversed the small bridge .
he snatched it from her , i can carry all our stuff , anyway , ', he said . leaning on him , moving step by step . every step an agony of soreness and cold . lifting her feet each time by a separate effort of her numbed will . she plodded beside him , while he tried to aid her with a hand under her elbow .
the very day that mrs. [female] left her she wrote the letter . and captain marrable had it in his pocket when he went down to bid a last farewell to his father . it had been a sad , weary , tear laden performance , -- the writing of that letter . she had resolved that no sign of a tear should be on the paper . and she had rubbed the moisture away from her eyes a dozen times during the work lest it should fall .
he had entirely lost faith in his own judgment . that judgment on which he had relied for so many years seemed recently . like a false companion unmasked , to have disclosed unexpected depths of hypocrisy and speciousness where all had seemed solidity . he felt almost afraid to form a conjecture on the weather . or the time , or the fruit promise , so great was his self abasement , his notice was attracted by a thin blue haze of smoke .
at any rate i kept on my guard . so that miss tita should not have occasion again to ask me if i had an arriere pensee . poor woman , before we parted for the night my mind was at rest as to her capacity for entertaining one . there was something affecting in the good faith of this sketch of former social glories . the picnic at the lido had remained vivid through the ages .
madame , replied [male] , rather agitated , i came on business . one single word , and quickly , if you please , and he entered the salon . madame vanel had risen , paler , more livid . than envy herself , [female] in vain addressed her . with the most agreeable , most pacific salutation ; she only replied by a terrible glance darted at the marquise and [female] .
he watched her braid of hair swinging from side to side as she galloped away . with no regret for his rejected truce of the fence . she would come back to cut it again , and again he would see her . disloyal as it might be to his employer . he hoped she would not delay the next excursion long .
all that stood by marvelled , and most of the eleven kings were glad that they had a king so noble in birth and doing as [male] . the son of uther [organization] , it happened that on a day king [male] . wandering from his court , had fought and vanquished a valiant knight , but he himself had been sore wounded . [male] , coming to his aid , had taken him to a hermit 's cave . and there with many marvellous salves had searched his wounds , so that in three days the king was whole again .
but what was he to do ? if his bill were dishonoured , the fact would certainly become known at his office . and he might even ultimately be arrested , in the doorway at the bottom of the stairs he stood for some moments . looking over at [male] and bangles ' , and he did not at all like the aspect of the establishment . inside the office he could see a man standing with a cigar in his mouth . very resplendent with a new hat , -- with a hat remarkable for the bold upward curve of its rim .
he dropped his head again upon his folded arms . and [male] knelt by his side for some minutes watching him silently . but he never stirred and she was too much frightened and surprised by his anger . and remorsefully impressed with a vague sense of her own wrong doing , to dare address him further . so at last she got up and went away , she began to feel that she had been .
`` perhaps you would not mind reading these letters , '' the duke said to mrs. finn . when she again went to him , in compliance with a message from him asking for her presence . then she sat down and read two letters , one from [female] . and the other from a mrs. [male] , each of which contained an invitation for his daughter . and expressed a hope that lady [female] would not be unwilling to spend some time with the writer .
after supper , he began to ask me many questions . of where i had been , what i had been doing , how i had found him out . but i gave him only very partial replies : it was too late to enter into particulars that night . besides , i wished to touch no deep thrilling chord -- to open no fresh well of emotion in his heart . my sole present aim was to cheer him , cheered , as i have said .
when clarissa was at last well enough to be moved , her husband took her down to ventnor . where the sight of her boy , bright and blooming . and the sound of his first syllables -- little broken scraps of language . that are so sweet to mothers ears -- had a better influence than all [female] 's medicines . here , too , came her father , from nice , where he had been wintering .
he told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wished me to take charge of his estate . and he gave me a key to a compartment in the safe which stood in his study . telling me i would find his will there and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself to carry out with absolute fidelity . several months after i had returned home from my last visit . the first of march , 1886 , i think , i received a telegram from him asking me to come to him at once .
i could not see how it was : i heard you coming . it was spring , the door opened : -- oh , it was autumnal ! one day had fallen away like a leaf out of my forest , and i had not been there to see it go ! at what hour of the twenty-four does a day shed itself out of our lives ? not , i think , on the stroke of the clock , at midnight .
he rallied them upon the subject of mrs. [female] . how pretty , how good humoured , how she sung better then they did , and danced better . and how much handsomer she was ; and in doing this he omitted no ill natured thing that could vex them . and indeed , pushed too hard upon them , the old lady came down in the height of it . and to put a stop it to , told them all the discourse she had had with me .
like the nature he has fought until he understands . his disposition is at once kindly and terrible , outside the subtleties of his calling . he sees only red , relieved of the strenuousness of his occupation . he turns all the force of the wonderful energies that have carried him far where other men would have halted . to channels in which a gentle current makes flood enough , it is the mountain torrent and the canal .
at this threat that strange woman heaved herself up from her soft couch . she ran to him and flung her arms about his neck . set her cheek against his own , not eighteen years in the basha 's hareem had stifled the european mother in her . the passionate sicilian woman , fierce as a tiger in her maternal love . she was wise in that , for she knew that alone [female] was more easily controlled by her .
[male] how right job was , and could not resist what he knew to be his duty . but i can not tell you how heavy and sick at heart he was as he stood at the door to take a last fond . lingering look at [male] , he saw her sitting up in bed . her golden hair , dimmed with her one day 's illness . floating behind her , her head bound round with wetted cloths .
a cheap gold plated ring with the initials o. s. and the date inside . '03 -- probably a class ring from school , worth a few dollar , unsalable . he put the money under his pillow and the other things in the toe of an infantry boot . stuffing a stocking in on top of them . then for two hours his mind raced like a high power engine here and there through his life .
i looked at the young man , and saw that he meant what he said . when leo means what he says he always puts on a curious look about the mouth . it has been a trick of his from a child . now , as a matter of fact , i had no intention of allowing leo to go anywhere by himself . for my own sake , if not for his , i was far too attached to him for that .
in a short time the cavalier returned , conducting two ladies of a very engaging appearance . whom he presented as his wife and sister . they welcomed [male] with graceful kindness . but fatigue soon obliged her to retire to rest , and a consequent indisposition increased so rapidly . as to render it impracticable for her to quit her present abode on that day .
but at present this caution against a too hasty judgment interests me more in relation to mr. [male] than to his young [male] . if to [male] mr. [male] had been the mere occasion which had set alight the fine inflammable material of her youthful illusions . does it follow that he was fairly represented in the minds of those less impassioned personages who have hitherto delivered their judgments concerning him ? i protest against any absolute conclusion . any prejudice derived from mrs. [female] 's contempt for a neighboring clergyman 's alleged greatness of soul .
stories , sometimes fairy tales , sometimes makin rhymes to myself . but always happy and contented , there was not a bit of the way i had not a name for in my own mind . either some place i read about , or some scene in a story of my own . but better than all , there was a dog , -- a poor starved lurcher he was . with a bit of the tail cut off .
radway 's task was not merely to level out and ballast the six feet of a road bed already constructed . but to cut a way for five miles through the unbroken wilderness . the way had moreover to be not less than twenty five feet wide , needed to be absolutely level and free from any kind of obstructions . and required in the swamps liberal ballasting with poles , called [female] . to one who will take the trouble to recall the variety of woods .
[organization] passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor . and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce , the next day must clear up every doubt . and unless his near neighbor and would be friend , the count of monte cristo . possessed the ring of gyges , and by its power was able to render himself invisible . it was very certain he could not escape this time .
the disgracefully deceitful circumstances under which mrs. [male] had married . the purpose of concealment which the marriage was intended to answer . might well keep her silent for caution 's sake . perhaps for her own pride 's sake also , even assuming that she had the means . in his absence , of communicating with the father of her unborn child .
let sir [male] be partly excused until the grounds of his action can be more fully known . the mistakes in his behavior to [male] were due to that dullness toward what may be going on in other minds . especially the minds of children , which is among the commonest deficiencies . even in good natured men like him , when life has been generally easy to themselves . and their energies have been quietly spent in feeling gratified , no one was better aware than he that [male] was generally suspected to be his own son .
stephen opened the door , and let in the fresh air and morning light . but the sight in the quadrangle was too ugly for the eyes of women . `` do not come out , '' he called sharply over his shoulder as he turned past the barricade . with rostafel at his back , the courtyard was hideous as a slaughter house . only the sky of rose and gold reminded him of the world 's beauty and the glory of morning .
but i , whom nature makes of tender mould . and youth most pliant yields to fancy 's fire , do build my haven and heaven on sweet desire . on sweet desire , more dear to me than gold . think i of love , oh , how my lines aspire ! how haste the muses to embrace my brows .
she made the first overtures of reconciliation by offering to have the little girl . who could help her in the house , to live with her . [female] consented to this , but when the time for parting came , all his courage failed him . then there was a final , complete rupture , as his affections vanished , he clung more closely to the love of his child . she made him anxious , however , for she coughed sometimes .
in a golden incubator upon the roof of our palace lay a snow white egg . for nearly five years ten soldiers of the jeddak 's guard had constantly stood over it . and not a day passed when i was in the city that dejah thoris and i did not stand hand in hand before our little shrine planning for the future . when the delicate shell should break , vivid in my memory is the picture of the last night as we sat there talking in low tones of the strange romance which had woven our lives together and of this wonder which was coming to augment our happiness and fulfill our hopes . in the distance we saw the bright white light of an approaching airship .
the story how it came to be so need not be very long ; -- nor will it . as i think , entail any great degree of odious criminality either upon the man or upon the woman . atlouis mrs. [female] had become acquainted with two brothers named lefroy . who had come up from louisiana , and had achieved for themselves characters which were by no means desirable . they were sons of a planter who had been rich in extent of acres and number of slaves before the war of the secession .
my sister was never left alone now ; but [female] more than readily undertook the care of her on that sunday afternoon . and [female] and i went out together , it was summer time , and lovely weather . when we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard . and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on . i began to combine miss havisham and estella with the prospect .
before the end of the course of drinking the waters . prince shtcherbatsky , who had gone on from carlsbad to [male] and kissingen to russian friends . to get a breath of russian air , as he said . came back to his wife and daughter , the prince returned thinner . with the skin hanging in loose bags on his cheeks .
just such a latent animation glowed in [female] leath . in every nerve and vein she was conscious of that equipoise of bliss which the fearful human heart scarce dares acknowledge . she was not used to strong or full emotions ; but she had always known that she should not be afraid of them . she was not afraid now ; but she felt a deep inward stillness . the immediate effect of the feeling had been to send her forth in [female] of her step son .
dauntless was she now , as she paced there in the cool of the orchard . under the pink and white petals of the apricots . the flaming scarlet of pomegranate blossoms . and through orange groves where the golden fruit glowed and amid foliage of sombre green . she was at her eternal work of poisoning the mind of her lord against [female] .
mother acerbically declined to learn the art of physical culture . `` me at my time of life learning to do monkey shines and bending and flapping my arms like a chicken with its head cut off . '' but father enthusiastically and immediately started in to become the rival of the gentlemen in jerseys who wear rubber heels in the advertisements and spend their old ages in vigorously walking from [location] to the pacific . merely in order to walk back again , while his fellow hoboes about the fire jeered . father bent over forty times , and raised himself on his toes sixty .
it was his object to procure the servant 's absence when [male] should arrive . resolved as he was to greet him with a sound rating for his folly . reflection had brought him the assurance that this was become his duty in view of his projected absence from penarrow . and in his brother 's interest he was determined not to spare him . he took a deep draught of the posset .
the gomez cushion was three inches thicker than that of the bug . which resulted in a mattress two stories in front with a lean-to at the foot . and the entire edifice highly slippery , but with a blanket from milt 's [male] . it was sufficient , to claire , milt gave another blanket , his collection of antique overcoats . and good advice , he spoke vaguely of a third blanket for himself .
it was the usual small town , which nestles at the foot of a hill and eventually climbs over it . through the enterprise of its wealthier residents , but , save for miss hathaway 's house . the enterprise had not , as yet , become evident , at the foot of the hill . on the left , was miss ainslie 's house and garden . and directly opposite , with the width of the hill between them .
and now i paused , for the second time that night i was going beyond myself . venturing out of what i looked on as my natural habits -- speaking in an unpremeditated . impulsive strain , which startled me strangely when i halted to reflect . on rising that morning , had i anticipated that before night i should have acted the part of a gay lover in a vaudeville . and an hour after , frankly discussed with [male] the question of his hapless suit .
nothing , however , could be less curious than this curiosity , a great piece of waste ground . on which [male] , amid a mass of sand and stones . were a few break wheels , already rusty , surrounded by a quadrangular building pierced by a number of little windows . the building was unfinished ; the sky could be seen through the joists of the roofing . attached to the stop plank of the gable a bunch of straw mixed with corn ears fluttered its tricoloured ribbons in the wind .
mr. [male] , to tell the truth . was becoming sick of it , when emilius . or mealyus , was supposed to have absconded , lady [male] left mr. [female] 's house . and located herself at one of the large [location] hotels . but when the man came back , bolder than ever , she again betook herself to the shelter of mr. [female] 's roof .
i am much obliged to you for going to [female] 's . i send stamps for two shillings and fourpence . which is what i owe you , it used only to be two shillings and twopence . but they say everything has got to be dearer now , and i suppose pills as well as other things . only think of [female] coming to me .
only , the wounded man did not stir , and [male] did not know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a dead corpse . his first sensation was one of blindness , all of a sudden , he could see nothing . it seemed to him too , that , in one instant . he had become deaf , he no longer heard anything . the frantic storm of murder which had been let loose a few feet above his head did not reach him .
mrs. wardour hurried to the kitchen , found the door on the latch . believed everything and much more , went straight to her son 's room . and , in a calm rage , woke him up , and poured into his unwilling ears a torrent of mingled fact and fiction . wherein floated side by side with [female] 's name every bad adjective she could bring the lips of propriety to utter . before he quite came to himself the news had well nigh driven him mad .
or , as soon as [male] came with his bunch of early roses . it was desirable for cynthia to go and rest in her own room . while molly had to accompany mrs. [female] on some improvised errand or call . still [female] , whose object was to give pleasure to cynthia . and who had , from his boyhood , been always certain of mr. [male] 's friendly regard .
[female] bathed the poor girl 's temples . and [female] , with unwonted energy , brought a glass of wine . soon miss muir 's lips trembled , she sighed . then murmured , tenderly , with a pretty scotch accent , as if wandering in the past . `` bide wi '' me , mither .
however , he got his indictment deferred , upon promise to discover his accomplices . and particularly the man that was concerned with him in his robbery . and he failed not to do his endeavour , for he gave in my name . whom he called [male] spencer . which was the name i went by to him ; and here appeared the wisdom of my concealing my name and sex from him .
on my return in the afternoon i gave an enthusiastic account of my day 's ramble . speaking not of the things that had moved my soul , but only of those which move the guayana indian 's soul . the animal food he craves , and which , one would imagine , nature would prefer him to do without . so hard he finds it to wrest a sufficiency from her . to my surprise they shook their heads and looked troubled at what i said .
this invitation of [female] 's removed all lady [female] 's difficulties . and it was consequently soon settled that [female] should not go to bath till lady [female] took her . and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge . so far all was perfectly right ; but lady [female] was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan . when it burst on her , which was , mrs clay 's being engaged to go to bath with sir [male] and [male] .
the woman had reached the first angle of the square when the upper half of the court house door broke into light over the heads of the crowd . a man had come out , he surged through the crowd and came down to the gate with a tail of people trailing after him and asking questions . it was casar , he crossed the street to the `` mitre . '' the woman trembled and turned towards the lane at the back . she walked quicker than ever now , but , stumbling over the irregular cobbles of the paved way .
he would occasionally stand for a while at the gate of the colonel 's garden . and repeat the list of his own woes as long as his neighbour would stand there to hear it . but there was no society at [female] , and [female] . as far as she herself was aware , was the only person with whom mrs. [female] held any social intercourse . except what she might have during her short annual holiday in [location] .
we waited , the groups of men . head down to it , waited , mr. [male] . restless , angry , his blue eyes as bitter as the cold . his mouth as much a snarl as the snarl of the elements with which he fought , waited . the samurai waited , tranquil , casual , remote , and cape horn waited .
after all , he reflected bitterly , this girl was only alone because she was on her way somewhere to meet some confounded man . besides there was no earthly chance of getting to know her , you can not rush up to pretty girls in the street and tell them you are lonely . at least , you can , but it does not get you anywhere except the police station . [male] 's gloom deepened -- a thing he would not have believed possible a moment before . he felt that he had been born too late , the restraints of modern civilization irked him .
one day he received a surprise . mrs. [female] came to see him . quite on her own account , jude 's wife . whose feelings as to where his affections were centred had reached absolute indifference by this time . went out , leaving the old woman alone with jude , he impulsively asked how sue was .
on the paper before her , she was startled with their significance . `` and four months ago i had never even heard of him , '' she said to herself , almost with awe , and now he was more to her . and nearer to her , than even was her sister or her mother ! she recollected how she had laughed at him behind his back .
it is strange that this element of incongruity . underlying the whole humour and purpose of the book . should have been so little heeded by the majority of those who have undertaken to interpret [female] . it has been completely overlooked , for example , by the illustrators . to be sure , the great majority of the artists who illustrated [male]
leaving [female] to go upstairs alone , i went out to look about me in the walks near the house . the circumstances under which [female] had parted from her had made me secretly anxious to know how count [female] was passing the afternoon . and had rendered me secretly distrustful of the results of that solitary journey from which sir [male] had returned but a few hours since . after looking for them in every direction and discovering nothing . i returned to the house , and entered the different rooms on the ground floor one after another .
sir , an i did then i were shamed for ever in this world . and false of my promise , therefore , said sir i [male] . i pray you hold your promise that ye promised me . for this is my desire , that ye will give me [male] beale isoud to go with me into cornwall for to be wedded to king mark , mine uncle . as for that , said king anguish , ye shall have her with you to do with her what it please you .
occasionally he stopped , listened to the firing , and gazed intently at the battlefield . but not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where he was standing down below . or from the knoll above on which some of his generals had taken their stand . but even from the fleches themselves -- in which by this time there were now russian and now french soldiers . alternately or together , dead , wounded , alive , frightened , or maddened -- even at those fleches themselves it was impossible to make out what was taking place .
`` still , that 's not the point , '' said sergey ivanovitch , frowning . he disliked contradiction . and still more , arguments that were continually skipping from one thing to another , introducing new and disconnected points . so that there was no knowing to which to reply , `` do you admit that education is a benefit for the people ? '' `` yes , i admit it , '' said levin without thinking . and he was conscious immediately that he had said what he did not think .
for a cow might come and look into the water , and put her yellow lips down . a kingfisher , like a blue arrow , might shoot through the dark alleys over the channel . or sit on a dipping withy bough with his beak sunk into his breast feathers . even an otter might float downstream likening himself to a log of wood . with his flat head flush with the water top , and his oily eyes peering quietly .
he heard her now , and looking up saw her standing in the glow and flicker of the firelight . which played upon her white face and black draped form . he started violently ; as he did so she loosed the heavy cloak and hood that she wore and it fell behind her . but where was the lovely rounded form , and where the clustering golden curls ? gone , and in their place a coarse robe of blue serge .
for several miles before they reached [female] . they saw a deep lead coloured cloud hanging over the horizon in the direction in which it lay . it was all the darker from contrast with the pale gray blue of the wintry sky . for in [female] there had been the earliest signs of frost . nearer to the town , the air had a faint taste and smell of smoke .
when he reached the summit of the tower . before emerging from the shadow of the staircase and stepping upon the platform . he cautiously examined the position of the priest . the priest 's back was turned to him . there is an openwork balustrade which surrounds the platform of the bell tower .
this was the woman whom he had prayed to remain awhile with his daughter after his wife had been laid in her grave . in order that there might be someone near whom he could trust ! and this very woman whom he had so trusted , -- whom , in his early associations with her . he had disliked and distrusted , but had taught himself both to like and to trust because his wife had loved her . this woman was the she pandarus who had managed matters between [male] and his daughter !
having dispatched an hasty meal , they again set forward in the way pointed out to them as the route of the fugitives . the country assumed a more civilized aspect , corn , vineyards . olives , and groves of mulberry trees adorned the hills . the vallies , luxuriant in shade . were frequently embellished by the windings of a lucid stream , and diversified by clusters of half seen cottages .
nothing big , but just a small weekly for experimental circulation in my civilization nurseries . he took to it like a duck . there was an editor concealed in him , sure , already he had doubled himself in one way . he talked sixth century and wrote nineteenth , his journalistic style was climbing , steadily . it was already up to the back settlement alabama mark .
[male] very earnestly to [male] , and did not observe the tender reproach in viviette 's eyes when he showed by his tale his decided notion that the prime use of dark nights lay in their furtherance of practical astronomy . everything being now satisfactorily explained the three retired to their several chambers , and [male] heard no more noises that night . or rather morning ; his attempts to solve the mystery of viviette 's life here and her relations withcleeve having thus far resulted chiefly in perplexity . true , an admission had been wrung from her ; and even without such an admission it was clear that she had a tender feeling for swithin . how to extinguish that romantic folly it now became his object to consider .
`` oh , yes , '' said [female] , blushing still more , with the vague sense of something new in [male] . and turning away to pour out [male] 's draught ; [male] meanwhile throwing back his head with his eyes shut . unable to get his mind away from the ideas that had been filling it while the reading was going on . [male] for a moment stood thinking of nothing but the walk . till [male] turned round again and brought the draught .
as for the other person , as for the unknown man who had saved marius . the researches were at first to some extent successful , then came to an abrupt conclusion . they succeeded in finding the carriage which had brought marius to the rue des filles du calvaire on the evening of the 6th of june . the coachman declared that , on the 6th of june , in obedience to the commands of a police agent . he had stood from three o'clock in the afternoon until nightfall on the quai des champs elysees .
when i went in early the next morning , the lady was clean worn out again . and lay in a kind of faint sleep . mr. [male] brought his partner . mr. [male] , with him to advise . they said she must not be [female] out of her rest on any account .
the traveller 's soup was succeeded by a dish of meat . and that by a dish of vegetables , he ate all that was placed before him . emptied his bottle of wine , called for a glass of rum . and smoked his cigarette with his cup of coffee . as he became refreshed , he became overbearing ; and patronised the company at the daybreak in certain small talk at which he assisted .
[female] had remained in the window , very handsome and upright , the outer dark framing in a highly favourable way her summery simplicities and lightnesses of dress . milly had , given the relation of space , no real fear she had heard their talk . only she hovered there as with conscious eyes and some added advantage . then indeed , with small delay , her friend sufficiently saw , the conscious eyes . the added advantage were but those she had now always at command .
only , this humor seizes upon her , and again abandons her . and therein lies the great peril for those who run when she desires only to walk . or who walk on when she desires to halt , [location] has her relapses into materialism . and , at certain instants , the ideas which obstruct that sublime brain have no longer anything which recalls french greatness and are of the dimensions of a [location] or a [location] . what is to be done in such a case ? the giantess plays at being a dwarf .
it was one of those plays which start wrong and never recover , by the end of the first ten minutes there had spread through the theatre that uneasy feeling which comes over the audience at an opening performance when it realizes that it is going to be bored . a sort of lethargy had gripped the stalls . the dress circle was coughing , up in the gallery there was grim silence . the acting did nothing to dispel the growing uneasiness , sir chester himself . apparently oppressed by the weightiness of the occasion and the responsibility of offering an unfamiliar brand of goods to his public .
as they descended , they heard the minster bells playing a hymn . when the hour had struck six , so , to ursula 's ear , the tune fell out . drop by drop , from the unseen sky on to the dusky town . it was like dim , bygone centuries sounding . it was all so far off , she stood in the old yard of the inn .
the next day was the eve of that on which he was to depart . of the day on which she was to bid adieu to dorriforth . to her guardian , to lord elmwood ; to all her hopes at once , the moment she awoke on monday morning . the recollection , that this was , perhaps , the last day she was ever again to see him . softened all the resentment his yesterday 's conduct had raised .
now , it would be really having [male] in their neighbourhood . what were nine miles to a young man ? -- an hour 's ride . he would be always coming over , the difference in that respect of [location] and [location] was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never . sixteen miles -- nay , eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to manchester street . was a serious obstacle , were he ever able to get away , the day would be spent in coming and returning .
he could not let them know that [male] had been seeking love in the byways of life . and that night he mailed a check in payment of the undertaker 's bill . carefully leaving the stub empty , on the third day after [male] 's funeral he started for [location] . an interne from a local hospital , having newly finished his service there . had agreed to take over his work for a time , but [male] was faintly jealous when he installed doctor reynolds in his office .
it was a sad sight to see the collapse of briggs . everybody noticed it , even rose , and feeling the air getting chilly . and the sight of the enthralled briggs painful . she went in to order his room to be got ready . regretting now that she had pressed the poor boy to stay , she had forgotten lady caroline 's kill joy face for the moment .
andres went off rather down in the mouth , swearing he would go to look for the valiant [male] of [male] mancha and tell him exactly what had happened . and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold ; but for all that . he went off weeping , while his master stood laughing . he now came to a road branching in four directions . and immediately he was reminded of those cross roads where knights errant used to stop to consider which road they should take .
when a clever girl lets fly the arrows of wit she should be careful to see that a man 's vanity is not the bull 's eye . it is difficult for a man to reconcile a girl 's absorbing interest in picture hats . pearl powder , and paquin models with real brains . but somehow his own enthusiasm for baseball and golf never seems to him incompatible with superior intelligence . do not fancy your husband has ceased to love you merely because he no longer seems to notice your presence around the house .
he was pleased at the gratitude he received . but felt abashed at receiving it , this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these simple , kindly people . the chief steward , a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly through the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy . seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on [male] . pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all the uselessness of freeing the [male] .
he had the easiest way of taking all things in life , this gentleman . and having established clarissa with her lamp and books . sank lazily back into his corner , and gave himself up to a continued contemplation of the fair young face . almost as calmly as if it had been some masterpiece of the painter 's art in a picture gallery . he looked at his watch -- the prettiest little toy in gold and enamel .
`` i do not care what the little birds hear , '' said miss french . through her tears , i am a very unhappy girl ; -- i know that . and i do not care what anybody says , it is nothing to me what anybody says . i know what i feel , at this moment there was some dash of truth about her . the fish was so very heavy on hand that , do what she would .
the duke watched them out of sight . he wished he could take the good advice he had given them ... suppose he did take it , suppose he went to the bursar . obtained an exeat , fled straight to [location] , what just humiliation for [female] to come down and find her captive gone ! he pictured her staring around the quadrangle .
at length , in 1738 , three years after the arrival of [female] bourdonnais in this island . madame [female] tour was informed that the governor had a letter to give her from her aunt . she flew to port [female] ; maternal joy raised her mind above all trifling considerations . and she was careless on this occasion of appearing in her homely attire . [female] bourdonnais gave her a letter from her aunt .
then gouvernail went unto king anguish of [location] . and saluted him fair , the king welcomed him and asked him what he would . sir , said gouvernail , here is a knight near hand that desireth to speak with you . he bade me say he would do you service . what knight is he ? said the king , sir , said he .
we waited for no more , but followed [female] , who made a dash through the further room . and into another , there , on a mattress , crouched two forlorn figures , veiled as if in haste . and muffled in [female] satin habberahs such as turkish ladies wear in the street . `` lord [female] , oh , how glad i am , '' cried one of these creatures . while the other , less vital or more miserable , whimpered and gurgled a little behind her veil .
soon after this came the news that the father was dead , this dealt the [female] a terrible blow . she never left her bed after it . and so the year had worn on ; and felipe , mourning over his sinking and failing mother . and haunted by terrible fears about the lost ramona , had been tortured indeed , but the end drew near , now . the [male] was plainly dying , the [location] doctor had left off coming .
`` not this morning , '' he said to the dog . you wo not do for ladies company , dripping wet , lie down . [male] followed the man and the dog into the boat . and took his seat , the dog did as he was ordered . the man remained standing , with his hands in his pockets .
yes ; she had done this , another woman might have spent that bridal eve in vain tears and lamentations . in feeble prayers , and such weak struggles as might have been evidenced by the destruction of a few letters . a tress of hair , some fragile foolish tokens of a wasted love . she would have burnt five out of six letters , perhaps , that helpless . ordinary sinner , and would have kept the sixth , to hoard away hidden among her matrimonial trousseau .
not there , not there , she would have been a stranger sight in her old home now . even than that home had been at first , without her , but , a lady sat in the familiar place . from whose heart she had never passed away ; in whose true memory she lived . unchanging , youthful , radiant with all promise and all hope ; in whose affection - and it was a mother 's now , there was a cherished little daughter playing by her side -
an extraordinary sweetness and [male] seemed in the place both to the senses and the soul of the young priest as he went up to the altar to vest . confessions had been heard last night ; and , as he turned . in the absolute stillness of the morning , and saw , beneath those carved angels that still today lean from the beams of the roof . the whole little space already filled with farm lads , many of whom were to approach the altar presently . and the grey head of their master kneeling on the floor to answer the mass .
after prince [male] , [male] came up to ask [male] for a dance . and then the aide de camp who had opened the ball , and several other young men . so that , flushed and happy , and passing on her superfluous partners to sonya . she did not cease dancing all the evening , she noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else . not only did she fail to notice that the emperor talked a long time with the french ambassador .
for hardly anybody doubted that some scandalous reason or other was at the bottom of [male] 's liberality to [male] . mr. [male] indeed , in the first instance , invited a select party . including the two physicians , with mr toller and mr. [male] . expressly to hold a close discussion as to the probabilities of [female] 's illness . reciting to them all the particulars which had been gathered from mrs. [female] in connection with [female] 's certificate .
when he got over the stile into the lane close to the mill door . he found that the mill was going , [male] had told him that it might probably be so . as he had heard that the repairs were nearly finished , [male] was sure that after so long a period of enforced idleness [male] would be in the mill . but he went at first into the house and there found mrs. [female] and [female] . even with them he hardly felt himself to be at home .
it 's funny how mrs. [female] always knows what mr. [male] wants before he knows himself and gets it before he asks for it ! as she went out of the gate the postman came in . and at the sight of another letter my heart slunk off into my slippers . and my brain seemed about to back up in a corner and refuse to work . in a flash it came to me that men ought not to write letters to women very much .
of great robberies in [location] , the details of which he discussed with amazing technical knowledge . he played tricks with the knives and forks . balanced the glasses in extraordinary fashion , and reduced our waiters to a state of numbed and amazed incapacity . every person who entered he seemed to have some slight acquaintance with . all the time he was acknowledging and returning greetings .
the instant he had spoken , [male] to his feet and pointed out of the window . a man on horseback was cantering towards the lodge . exchanging one quick look , both hastened to the door , and , advancing some twenty yards . waited under the tree on the spot where boris lay buried . `` by the way , '' said sapt , `` you forgot the dog . ''
she joined jude in a hasty meal . and in a quarter of an hour they started together . resolving to clear out from sue 's too respectable lodging immediately , on reaching the place and going upstairs she found that all was quiet in the children 's room . and called to the landlady in timorous tones to please bring up the tea kettle and something for their breakfast . this was perfunctorily done , and producing a couple of eggs which she had brought with her she put them into the boiling kettle .
the young couple came in during the autumn ; they kept one maid . and i had an old servant , we had both very primitive furniture . mrs. [female] had left her father 's house without a dowry . she had not so much as a fashionable hat to bless herself with . she had sewed herself together a sort of head dress of her own invention .
no doubt mrs. [female] had told me the truth . [female] said brusquely with an unexpected hoarseness of tone . this very dress she was wearing had been given her by mrs. [female] . of course i looked at it . it could not have been a recent gift , close fitting and [female] .
'you are mysterious , but i leave all to you and wait for my reward . when shall i have it , [female] ? she laughed . and answered so low i could not hear , for they left the gallery as they spoke . forgive me , general , for the pain i inflict . you are the only person to whom i have spoken .
[male] , whose ears were rather sensitive , had gone out to see what sort of evening it was at an early stage in the ceremony . and had not finished his contemplation until a silence of five minutes declared that `` drink , boys , drink ! '' was not likely to begin again for the next twelvemonth , much to the regret of the boys and totty . on them the stillness fell rather flat , after that glorious thumping of the table . towards which totty , seated on her father 's knee .
but at the end of a week he found that . without any effort on his part , -- almost in opposition to efforts on his part . he had fallen into an easy [male] way with these men which was very delightful to him . he had killed a stag in company with mr. [male] . and had stopped beneath a crag to discuss with him a question as to the duty on irish malt .
the gamin is a [male] to the nation . and at the same time a disease ; a disease which must be cured , how , by light . all generous social irradiations spring from science . letters , arts , education . make men , make men . give them light that they may warm you .
the appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment . it was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again . their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings ; she had derived from it a delightful conviction . but she feared from his looks , that the same unfortunate persuasion . which had hastened him away from the concert room , still governed .
the conference ended with an assurance on the part of lord tulla that if the loughshaners chose to elect mr. [male] he would not be in the least offended . the electors did elect mr. [male] . perhaps for the reason given by one of the [location] conservative papers . which declared that it was all the fault of the carlton club in not sending a proper candidate . there was a great deal said about the matter , both in [location] and [location] .
presently , i heard a snuffling sound behind me and then a dog came frisking and wriggling to my feet . it was my own snap—the little dark , wire haired terrier ! when i spoke his name , he leapt up in my face and yelled for joy . almost as much delighted as himself , i caught the little creature in my arms . and kissed him repeatedly , but how came he to be there ? he could not have dropped from the sky .
he turned half round to look up at those eager watchers at the window , good god ! it was his sister [male] 's face he saw . no longer full of triumph and pleasure , but ghastly pale , and staring at someone or something horrible in the crowd . [male] turned to look for this horrible something the sight of which had power to change his sister 's face . and found himself confronted by a young man , -- a young man whose eyes flamed like coals of fire .
he was encouraged to talk of those wars of the gods at which he had been present . and was so treated as to make him feel that he was somebody in the world of [location] . now he was invited to give all this up ; and for what ? he answered that question to himself with enthusiastic eloquence . the reward offered to him was the thing which in all the world he liked best . it was suggested to him that he should again have within his reach that parliamentary renown which had once been the very breath of his nostrils .
in the words of the proverb , i was resolved not to let the grass grow under my feet . the next morning i set forth to seek an interview with mrs. [female] . this was my first step forward in the investigation , the story of the desperate attempt to which i now stood committed begins here . the address communicated by mrs. [female] took me to a lodging house situated in a respectable street near the gray 's inn road . when i knocked the door was opened by mrs. [female] herself .
he decided to sleep over it , and by morning he found himself not only disinclined to the business . but firmly resolved to let it drop , things were well enough as they were . the woman in the case was making good , jud was making good . and nothing would restore [male] to that small theatrical world of his which had waved him good-bye at the station so long ago . he shaved and dressed , his resolution still holding , he had indeed almost a conscious glow of virtue .
what a pity you were not at the arkharovs ', on thursday . it was so dull without you , said she . giving him a tender smile . the young man , flattered , sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile . and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of sonya .
comes a train of little ladies from scholastic trammels free . each a little bit afraid is , wondering what the world can be , is it but a world of trouble . sadness set to song ? is its beauty but a bubble bound to break ere long ? are its palaces and pleasures fantasies that fade ? and the glory of its treasures shadow of a shade ?
baldos was undeniably ill. beverly , between her exclamations of joy and relief at being in sight of ganlook . was profuse in her expressions of concern for the hero of the hawk and raven . the feverish gleam in his dark eyes and the pain that marked his face touched her deeply . suffering softened his lean , sun browned features , obliterating the mocking lines that had impressed her so unfavorably at the outset . she was saying to herself that he was handsome after a most unusual cast .
with so much true merit and true love , and no want of fortune and friends . the happiness of the married cousins must appear as secure as earthly happiness can be . equally formed for domestic life , and attached to country pleasures . their home was the home of affection and comfort . and to complete the picture of good , the acquisition of mansfield living .
and he , too , felt the thrill of an excitement working subtly within him . and this thrill pounded in swifter running blood when he saw the men about the fire jump to their feet suddenly and go to meet new and shadowy figures that came up indistinctly just in the edge of the forest gloom . there they mingled and were lost in identity for a long time . and [male] wondered if the newcomers were of the people of chateau boulain . after that , bateese and [male] and two others stamped out the fires and came over the plank to the bateau to sleep .
he was not one who brooked delay : within the chamber of his state . the chief of este 's ancient sway upon his throne of judgement sate . his nobles and his guards are there , -- before him is the sinful pair . both young , -- and one how passing fair , with swordless belt , and fettered hand . oh , [male] , that thus a son should stand 140 before a father 's face !
she stopped , regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much . but less would hardly have been sufficient , [male] would hardly have believed so soon in mr elliot 's failure . but from the perception of there being a somebody else , as it was . she instantly submitted , and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond . and [female] , eager to escape farther notice , was impatient to know why [female] should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot .
that spectral moonlight camoodi was one of many serpent fancies that troubled me . there was another , surpassing them all , which attended me many days . when the sun grew hot overhead and the way was over open savannah country . i would see something moving on the ground at my side and always keeping abreast of me . a small snake , one or two feet long , no , not a small snake .
and now the lids sank and the heads reappeared . i had marked three , the whisperers , and i did not scruple to take a very steady look at them as they emerged from their temporary eclipse . it is astonishing what ease and courage their little phrases of flippancy had given me . the idea by which i had been awed was that the youthful beings before me . with their dark nun like robes and softly braided hair , were a kind of half angels .
i repeated the question , the lips moved . she placed the tips of her fingers on them . again i repeated the question , `` yes , '' maud announced , we looked at each other expectantly . she looked at me queerly , i saw her lips trembling and the tears swimming up in her eyes . she swayed toward me and i caught her in my arms .
he lifted his face to where the storm swept above him . and for an instant he fancied that high up on the ragged edge of the rock there might have stood [male] . with his great , gaping , hungry heart , filled with pain and yearning . staring off into the face of the almighty , and he fancied . too , that beside him there hovered the wife and mother .
pull , pull , he was the judge of his island . and he had outraged justice , holding a false title . living on a false honour , he was safe of no man 's respect . secure of no woman 's goodwill . exposure hung over him .
the cupola floors were not all laid , if you had stood on the distributing floor . over the tops of the bins , you might have looked not only down through a score of openings between plank areas and piles of timbers . into [male] pits , sixteen feet square by seventy deep . but upward through a grill of girders and joists to the clear sky . everywhere men swarmed over the work , and the buzz of the electric lights and the sounds of hundreds of hammers blended into a confused hum .
when he regained his dungeon , he threw himself on his bed . where the turnkey found him in the evening visit . sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features , dumb and motionless as a statue . during these hours of profound meditation , which to him had seemed only minutes . he had formed a fearful resolution , and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath .
but suddenly a robin sang ( as they will do after dark . towards spring ) in the brown fern and ivy behind me . i took it for our little annie 's voice . and gathering quick warm comfort , sprang up the steep way towards the starlight . climbing back , as the stones glid down , i heard the cold greedy wave go japping .
my mind was very clear just then ; past and present were clear to me . the future clearest of all : i could measure the extent of my action and speculate on its future effect . and my sense of right or wrong -- of individual responsibility . was more vivid than at any other period of my life , can i even say that i was blinded by passion ? driven , perhaps , but certainly not blinded , for no reaction , or submission .
ah , how pretty they were , how elegant he had made them in his reckless disregard of expense . his artistic delight in the task of beautification ! there were no shutters here , and the summer breeze blew in through the broken windows . and stirred the [location] muslin curtains . the gay chintz draperies .
`` any day , or every day , and the more days the better , '' cried [male] , as he sat down at the table . where all had now taken their places , the supper was a great success . with much laughter and chaffing , the girls flitted from place to place . pouring cups of tea and passing the various dishes .
for two hundred francs a year he managed to live on the border of the provinces of caux and picardy . in a kind of place half farm . half private house ; and here , soured , eaten up with regrets , cursing his luck . jealous of everyone , he shut himself up at the age of forty five . sick of men , he said , and determined to live at [male] .
`` yes , '' again says i , very much like a child , you may be sure . and still i cried heartily , i had no policy in all this ; you may easily see it was all nature . but it was joined with so much innocence and so much passion that . in short , it set the good motherly creature a weeping too . and she cried at last as fast as i did , and then took me and led me out of the teaching room .
but for the european escape was another matter , there were not so many white prisoners but that each was a marked man . besides relays of camels stationed through the desert . much money , long preparations , and above all , devoted natives who would risk their lives . were the first necessities for their evasion , the camels might be procured and stationed . but it did not follow that their drivers would remain at the stations .
fawley 's aunt being a baker she made him a bride cake . saying bitterly that it was the last thing she could do for him . poor silly fellow ; and that it would have been far better if , instead of his living to trouble her . he had gone underground years before with his father and mother . of this cake [male] took some slices .
mrs. [female] dropped into an attitude of tense listening . the sun began dissipating the gray mists and heightening the exquisite tints on all sides . every green imaginable was there from palest silver to the deepest , darkest shades . all dew wet , rankly growing , gold tinted and showing clearer each minute . gradually mrs. [female] relaxed , made herself comfortable as possible .
mr. [male] walked home alone . and as he went there was something of a feeling of disappointment at heart . which made him ask himself whether mr. [male] might not have been right in rebuking him for joining the government . but this , i think , was in no way due to mr. [male] 's resignation . but rather to a conviction on mr. [male] 's part that that he had contributed but little to his country 's welfare by sitting in mr. [male] 's cabinet .
[female] had already paid the first month 's rent . and [female] had spent her evenings for the last few days in washing the windows and floors of this new house and in getting it into a state of perfect cleanliness . now , when the first night fell , they had two new mattresses and comfortables spread upon a clean floor . a new lamp , purchased from one of the nearby stores , a single box . borrowed by [female] from a grocery store .
she nervously wondered why the woman had not discovered her mistake and returned . and went again towards the bell pull , approaching the chimney her back was to [female] . but she could see him in the glass . an indescribable thrill passed through her as she perceived that the eyes of the reflected image were open . gazing wonderingly at her , and under the curious unexpectedness of the sight she became as if spellbound .
`` never displeasure , '' she said , lingeringly , and again she smiled . the smile might have struck a close observer as faintly , artificial , but what man in chilcote 's frame of mind has time to be observant where women are concerned ? the manner of the smile was very sweet and almost caressing . and that sufficed , she looked very graceful as she turned , holding the little animal up . she was a woman of twenty seven , but she looked a girl .
i do not know whether it may not be for the best , we shall lose such a neighbour as we never shall have again . he was the same as a brother to both of us . and i can only say , that loving him like a brother , i endeavoured to do the best for him that i could . this i do know ; -- that nothing on earth shall ever tempt me to set my hand at match making again . but it was alluring , -- the idea of bringing my two dearest friends near me together .
and still again , when the steward jammed a splinter under his nail . she was greatly concerned , and manipulated the tweezers and pulled it out . the elsinore reminds me of a slave plantation before the war . and miss west is the lady of the plantation . interested only in the house slaves , the field slaves are beyond her ken or consideration .
what was that fellow hanging round [female] for ? was it really as polteed suggested ? or was jolyon but taking compassion on her loneliness . as he would call it -- sentimental radical chap that he had always been ? if it were , indeed , as polteed hinted , soames stood still . it could not be , the fellow was seven years older than himself .
we of the roof party considered ourselves . figuratively speaking , above camels , far above donkeys , and scornful of motor cars . in which it was irreverent to charge up to the great pyramid as if to the door of a cafe . we walked , and [female] still lent herself to me . but she no longer bubbled over with delight at everything .
at these words mrs. milvain looked for a moment terribly apprehensive . she glanced at her niece 's face . but read no pity there , whereupon she folded her hands upon a [female] velvet bag which she carried in an attitude that was almost one of prayer . whatever divinity she prayed to , if pray she did . at any rate she recovered her dignity in a singular way and faced her niece .
[male] by force of character . by his self devotion , by his untiring energy and his exertions to lighten the lot of his companions in misery . had endeared himself to all , and become the leading spirit in the captive colony . and , incredible as it may seem , jealousy of his influence and the esteem in which he was held . moved this man to compass his destruction by a cruel death .
at a distance of some six paces he saw . not roddy , but a woman , and not a woman merely , but the girl he had met in the restaurant . the surprise was complete ; none , indeed , was ever more so ; but it 's a question which party thereto was the more affected . lanyard stared with the eyes of stupefaction . to his fancy , this thing passed the compass of simple incredulity .
telling him of the incident on the way back . the wind being as fierce as ever , we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase . but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there . it then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms . so , lighting my candle at the watchman 's , and leaving him standing at the door .
he was too unwell , he said , to preach himself . and the one curate would have the two entire services unless mr. [male] could help him . could mr. [male] come himself and see him on the sunday afternoon ? this note he sent away by a messenger . who came back with a reply , saying that mr. [male] would himself preach in the afternoon .
`` the fellow 's a genius , '' annesley seton said to constance . when they were talking over the latest phase of the game . and they respected him , lady annesley seton wished to bring to town the servants . including a wonderful [male] , who had been transferred for economy 's sake to [organization] . this proposal , however , [male] dismissed with a few good natured words .
as that was all the rum and water too , or , in other words . as [male] delicately signified that his glass was empty , by throwing back his head and standing the glass upside down on his nose and upper lip . it might have been charitable in mrs wilfer to suggest replenishment . but that heroine briefly suggesting `` bedtime '' instead , the bottles were put away . and the family retired ; she cherubically escorted , like some severe saint in a painting .
i could not keep him company there . withdrawing into a big dormer window , i waited with beating heart to see if her door would open . apparently not , yet as i still lingered , i heard the lock turn . followed by the sound of a measured but hurried step , dashing from my retreat . i reached the main hall in time to see miss [female] disappear toward the staircase .
but , in spite of [male] 's hope . the day passed unmarked by any incident , excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants . at one of these encounters , accidentally or purposely , [male] 's mask fell off . he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage . doubtless one of the charming females [male] had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry .
`` yes , dad , '' was all she said , for she had not the heart to tell him the truth . and she knew that [male] never would until the last moment he must . when he learned that she had failed , half an hour later . she could see the stone chimney of the little cabin in lonesome cove . a little farther down several spirals of smoke were visible -- rising from unseen houses which were more miners
she felt nothing but that [female] was cruel . cruel to write so , cruel not to marry her . reasons why he could not marry her had no existence for her mind . how could she believe in any misery that could come to her from the fulfilment of all she had been longing for and dreaming of ? she had not the ideas that could make up the notion of that misery .
`` so do i , '' she said , smiling now directly at him , `` good ! '' he said , and they went on -- [female] asking more questions . she was going to school at the county seat the coming winter and she was fifteen years old . `` that 's right , the trouble in the mountains is that you girls marry so early that you do not have time to get an education . '' she was not going to marry early , she said , but [female] learned now that she had a sweetheart who had been in town that day and apparently the two had had a quarrel .
and then , was it true ? was it the fact that mr maguire was ill treating some other woman in order that he might get her money ? in all her misery she remembered that mrs stumfold would not commit herself to any such direct assertion . and she remembered also that mrs stumfold had especially insisted on her own part of the grievance . on the fact that the suitable young lady had been met by mr maguire in her drawing room . as to mr maguire himself , she could reconcile herself to the loss of him .
he could hardly tell why , but even when released from the fosters parlour , he was unwilling to go to haytersbank farm . it was late , it is true , but on a may evening even country people keep up till eight or nine o'clock . perhaps it was because hepburn was still in his travel stained dress . having gone straight to the shop on his arrival in monkshaven . perhaps it was because , if he went this night for the short half hour intervening before bed time .
they did not open their lips again during the whole space of their ride . suicide , that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which may contain . in a measure , the death of the soul . was impossible to [female] , at the entrance to the rue [male] l'homme arme . the carriage halted , the way being too narrow to admit of the entrance of vehicles .
over her white wrappings , we started , the dance was to be held in the open air . on the smooth rocky plateau in front of the great cave . and thither we made our way . about fifteen paces from the mouth of the cave we found three chairs placed . and here we sat and waited , for as yet no dancers were to be seen .
it about convinced me that there is not any such thing as a new joke possible . everybody laughed at these antiquities -- but then they always do . i had noticed that , centuries later , however , of course the scoffer did not laugh . i mean the boy , no , he scoffed ; there was not anything he would not scoff at . he said the most of sir [male] 's jokes were rotten and the rest were petrified .
the grateful knight would not be likely to allow any old [location] friend of his preserver to languish at the village inn . the sleuth hound would at once be installed at the castle , where , unsuspected by [male] . he could keep an eye on the course of events . any looking after that mr. [male] might require could safely be left in the hands of this expert . with considerable fervor , mr. [male] congratulated himself on his astuteness .
she shut her lips hard , her jaw hardened . and she set herself to struggle with him . she wrenched her head away from his grip and got her arm between his chest and hers . they began to wrestle fiercely , each became frightfully aware of the other as a plastic energetic body . of the strong muscles of neck against cheek .
she was going to make him some promise . to tell him something of her intention towards his son . and to make some tender of assistance to himself . being now in that mind to live on the smallest possible pittance , of which i have before spoken . when he ceased speaking or listening .
some three weeks after [male] 's death [male] returned to [location] with his wife . and discovered the first letter , the telegram , and an additional note telling him that [male] was dead . he was truly grieved , for his affection for the girl had been real . he was very sorry for [male] , and he told his wife that he would have to go out and see her . he was wondering what she would do , she could not live alone .
but the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all faces -- that of fear . prince [male] for the second time asked the adjutant on duty to take in his name . but received an ironical look and was told that his turn would come in due course . after some others had been shown in and out of the minister 's room by the adjutant on duty . an officer who struck prince [male] by his humiliated and frightened air was admitted at that terrible door .
[female] related something to her the next day . which placed this matter in a still clearer light , willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them . and [male] , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and marianne . had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face . she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves .
she took out the torn handkerchief from her pocket again . and wrapped it deliberately round the necklace , mrs. [female] observed the action with some surprise . but the tone of her last words discouraged her from asking any question . the `` feeling '' [female] spoke of with an air of tragedy was not to be explained by the mere fact that she was going to be a governess . she was possessed by a spirit of general disappointment .
the courtyard and staircase of a palace built three hundred years ago are a peculiar feature of modern [male] . and interest the stranger more than many things of which he has heard loftier descriptions . you pass through the grand breadth and height of a squalid entrance way . and perhaps see a range of dusky pillars , forming a sort of cloister round the court . and in the intervals , from pillar to pillar , are strewn fragments of antique statues .
yes , he had given her chance enough to learn where he lived . and this minor proof of her indifference became , as he jammed his way through the crowd . the main point of his grievance against her and of his derision of himself . half way down the pier the prod of an umbrella increased his exasperation by rousing him to the fact that it was raining . instantly the narrow ledge became a battle ground of thrusting .
about a mile into the forest they came to a place where several ways met . under a grove of lofty and contorted oaks . even in the narrow horizon of the falling snow , it was a spot that could not fail to be recognised . and lawless evidently recognised it with particular delight , `` now , master [male] , '' said he , `` an you '' are not too proud to be the guest of a man who is neither a gentleman by birth nor so much as a good [male] .
the sound of children 's shrill laughter . which passed unnoticed by the parents , who had it always in their ears . rasped maïeddine 's nerves , and he would have liked to strike or kick the babies into silence . most arabs worship children , even girls . and are invariably kind to them , but today maïeddine hated anything that ran about disturbingly and made a noise .
she herself was desirous of disappearing for that evening . but lady [female] would not permit it , she has seen you . my dear , and asked about you , if you hide yourself . she will say all sorts of things . an introduction was therefore necessary , and lady hartletop 's manner was grotesquely grand .
it came to an end , and i was relieved . in the family there was an aunt who was not fond of me . i doubt if any of the family liked me much . but i never wanted them to like me , being altogether bound up in the one girl . the aunt was a young woman , and she had a serious way with her eyes of watching me .
[female] submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel . with regard to herself , it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not . and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan . and her sister exhilarated by it in look . voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation .
or again a caravan would be sighted in the far distance by the keen eyes of abou fatma . and they made their camels kneel and lay crouched behind a rock . with their loaded rifles in their hands , ten miles from [male] a relay of fresh camels awaited them . and upon these they travelled , keeping a day 's march westward of the nile . thence they passed through the desert country of the ababdeh .
it has been well said that in this world there is always something . a moment before , lady wetherby had been feeling completely contented , without a care on her horizon . it was foolish of her to have expected such a state of things to last . for what is life but a series of sharp corners . round each of which fate lies in wait for [male] with a stuffed eel skin ?
`` you are right , let [male] go , '' he answered mechanically . but without moving a step , i took him by the arm and led him along . he let himself be guided like a child . only from time to time murmuring . `` did you see her eyes ? '' and he turned as if the vision had recalled her .
this was the very month when the thenardiers , after having demanded twelve francs instead of six . had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve , fantine was overwhelmed . she could not leave the neighborhood ; she was in debt for her rent and furniture . fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt , she stammered a few supplicating words . the superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant .
`` you mean ... what has cordelia to do with it ? '' levin asked timidly . forgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent king lear , `` cordelia comes in .., see here ! '' said pestsov , tapping his finger on the satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and passing it to levin . only then levin recollected the title of the fantasia , and made haste to read in the russian translation the lines from [male] that were printed on the back of the program . `` you can not follow it without that , '' said pestsov .
i should not think of such a plan as this if i did not feel that it was the best thing for your interests . that is , if , as i fondly hope , i am ever to call you mine . of course , in that case , it is only common prudence on my part to do all i can to insure for myself such a professional income . for your sake , for , dearest [male] , my brightest earthly hope is to see you with everything comfortable around you . if that could be arranged , it would be quite within our means to keep some sort of carriage .
even more bleak than from a distance the house on the [organization] appeared as the riders approached it up the winding road . it stood solitary on its desert promontory . the bright sky behind it , not a shrub to ease its lines . not a barn or shed to make a rude background for its amazing proportions . native grass grew sparsely on the great table where it stood .
but inconsistently he knew she did not forget it . and it angered him , true to his insistence on ignoring those months of her absence . she made no attempt to tell him . now and then , however , closed in the library together , they would fail of things to talk about . and [male] knitting needles would be the only sound in the room .
it fell naturally to the count [female] [male] to make reply . not only was he the elder , but he had been presented to the prince by his father . besides , he had long known the prince . whilst [male] now saw him for the first time . he therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at mazingarbe .
the moon ascending it in solemn march . her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill tops . from behind which she had come , far and farther below her , and aspired to the zenith . midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance . and for those trembling stars that followed her course .
the big business man had regained his feet and was standing ankle deep in the water talking to the doctor when oteo suddenly plucked at his sleeve . `` the master -- '' he cried , the youth was staring down into the street . with a look of terror on his face . the big business man followed the direction of his glance . at the head of the steps a number of men had rushed upon the chemist and the two women .
no sooner were the little fat legs pushed down than up they came again . for totty 's eyes were too busy in staring at the large dishes to see where the [female] pudding was for her to retain any consciousness of her legs . [female] got quite out of patience , and at last , with a frown and pout . and gathering tears , she said , oh dear . aunt , i wish you would speak to totty ; she keeps putting her legs up so .
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin . and there could now be no doubt that he was the count . the three windows were still untenanted , preparations were making on every side . chairs were placed , scaffolds were raised , and windows were hung with flags . the masks could not appear ; the carriages could not move about ; but the masks were visible behind the windows .
she used to sit long hours upon the beach . gazing intently on the waves as they chafed with perpetual motion against the pebbly shore . or she looked out upon the more distant heave , and sparkle against the sky . and heard , without being conscious of hearing , the eternal psalm , which went up continually . she was soothed without knowing how or why , listlessly she sat there , on the ground .
they carried [female] away ; she had revived . but could scarcely move or speak , so shaken was her frame by the attack . she had , however , just power to give one parting look to her grandfather . who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul , d'avrigny followed the invalid . wrote a prescription , ordered villefort to take a cabriolet .
i could not stop to make any fresh investigations , i could only assure myself that the way was clear . and then leave the house with the two letters safe in my pocket . on my way to the village i prepared myself for the possibility of meeting sir [male] . as long as i had him to deal with alone i felt certain of not losing my presence of mind . any woman who is sure of her own wits is a match at any time for a man who is not sure of his own temper .
that breakfast , in all its details , was a most bewitching affair . ester felt that she could never enjoy that meal again . at a table that was not small and round , and covered with damask nor drink coffee that had not first flowed gracefully down from a silver urn . as for aunt [female] , she could have dispensed with her . she even caught herself drawing unfavorable comparisons between her and the patient .
the man addressed him in the language of the country . and his heart almost stopped beating , how was he to answer ? mumbling something almost inaudible . he hurried on to the ground floor . trembling with fear lest the man should call to him to halt . he was relieved to find , in the end , that his progress was not to be impeded .
every faculty in her seemed to be suspended by the silent passage into her mind of the new idea that he had called up . through childhood , girlhood , womanhood -- never once . waking or dreaming , had the prospect of restoration to sight presented itself within her range of contemplation , until now . not a trace was left in her countenance of the indignation which nugent had roused in her . hardly more than a moment since , not a sign appeared indicating a return of the nervous suffering which the sense of his presence had inflicted on her .
when we arrived at the town where we were to breakfast . i was determined to speak with philander and gustavus . and to that purpose as soon as i left the carriage . i went to the basket and tenderly enquired after their health , expressing my fears of the uneasiness of their situation . at first they seemed rather confused at my appearance dreading no doubt that i might call them to account for the money which our grandfather had left me and which they had unjustly deprived me of .
`` come in , '' he said to hilda at last , and closed the door behind her . he pointed to a chair by the fire and went back to his worktable . `` wo not you sit down ? '' he was standing behind the table . turning over a pile of blueprints nervously , the yellow light from the student 's lamp fell on his hands and the purple sleeves of his velvet smoking jacket . but his flushed face and big , hard head were in the shadow .
mr , fielding remained at the parsonage during the greater part of the following week . and then there took place a great deal of family conversation respecting the future incumbent of the living . at these family conclaves , however , [female] was not asked to be present . mrs. clavering , who knew well how to do such work . was gradually bringing her husband round to endure the name of mr. [male] .
nevertheless , when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with an old broken comb . and it flowed about her like floss silk . she experienced a moment of happy coquetry . she had been dismissed towards the end of the winter . the summer passed , but winter came again , short days , less work .
the reverend [male] lynde . who was a young man , with more zeal than experience . deemed it his duty to obey this injunction to the letter . but hitherto he had had to content himself with a talk with the housekeeper . or a brief word on the doorstep from wyant .
the rest of the household consisted of a gloomy child . `` tibby , '' aged eight ; a spaniel , probably a few years older . and an intermittent cat , who , when he did put in an appearance . was the life and soul of the party . but whose visits to his home were all too infrequent for [male] .
some days after this meeting , [male] morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs elysees . which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count 's princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences . he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter . signed `` baronne danglars , nee hermine [male] servieux . '' [male] was accompanied by [male] , who , joining in his friend 's conversation .
the schooner , heeled over far out from the perpendicular , was bowing and plunging into the long pacific roll . if she were heading south west as [female] had said , the wind . then , i calculated , was blowing nearly from the south , the fog was gone . and in its place the sun sparkled crisply on the surface of the water . i turned to the east , where i knew [location] must lie .
here in their seasons may be seen the country business of haymaking . ploughing , etc. , which are such [male] mysteries for townspeople to watch . and here the artisan , deafened with noise of tongues and engines . may come to listen awhile to the delicious sounds of rural life . the lowing of cattle , the milkmaid 's call .
if sitting with dignity in his hired carriage , and stepping with authority up the big front steps . would have done anything , dr fillgrave might have done much . lady [male] was greatly taken with his looks when he first came to her . and it was only when she by degrees perceived that the symptoms . which she knew so well , did not yield to him that she began to doubt those looks .
the noise of their passage had scarce begun to die away towards shoreby . before fresh hoofs came echoing in their wake , and another deserter clattered down the road . this time a single rider and , by his splendid armour . a man of high degree , close after him there followed several baggage waggons . fleeing at an ungainly canter , the drivers flailing at the horses as if for life .
after one or two short and very similar experiences , which are not to the present purpose . i entered another family where i had but one pupil . a girl of fifteen , who was the only daughter , the parents here were elderly people . people of station , and rich , a nephew whom they had brought up was a frequent visitor at the house . among many other visitors ; and he began to pay me attention .
it was a fortress of no great size . consisting of a donjon , or large and high square tower . surrounded by buildings of inferior height , which were encircled by an inner court yard . around the exterior wall was a deep moat , supplied with water from a neighbouring rivulet . front de boeuf , whose character placed him often at feud with his enemies .
a little while longer i sat by [female] 's side . catching the dim outline of his face , half uplifted . looking towards those myriad worlds , which we are taught to believe . and do believe , are not more precious in the almighty sight than one living human soul . in the winter , when the first snow lay on the ground .
then we walked away together and back to the home of the street sweepers . and we walked in silence , thus did it come to pass that each night . when the stars are high and the street sweepers sit in the city theatre . we , equality 7 2521 , steal out and run through the darkness to our place . it is easy to leave the theatre ; when the candles are blown and the actors come onto the stage .
they went up to his room and settled down ; the flies and moths fluttered round the candle . it was close , the child fell asleep , and the good man . beginning to doze with his hands on his stomach , was soon snoring with his mouth wide open . on other occasions , when [male] le cure . on his way back after administering the viaticum to some sick person in the neighbourhood .
did anything at this moment suggest to yeobright the sex of the creature whom that fantastic guise inclosed . how extended was her scope both in feeling and in making others feel . and how far her compass transcended that of her companions in the band ? when the disguised queen of love appeared before [female] a preternatural perfume accompanied her presence and betrayed her quality . if such a mysterious emanation ever was projected by the emotions of an earthly woman upon their object .
philip felt a buzzing in his head . and he was so dizzy that he could hardly stand , but he took the second oath also . then the bell rang again , and there was a great hubbub . gangways were drawn up , ropes were let go , the captain called to the shore from the bridge . and the blustering harbour master called to the bridge from the shore .
poor guy , -- i slipped out of his sight and left the lad alone with his mother . another hour passed of this strange , strange day . the house seemed painfully quiet , maud , disconsolate and cross . had taken herself away to the beech wood with walter . the father and [female] were busy at the mills .
d'artagnan looked at [female] with that air of wonder which a cunning man can not help feeling at displays of crass stupidity . but as [male] on his side could not comprehend his astonishment . he merely pushed him indoors . saying , `` let [male] go in , '' they found [male] in profound despondency . [male] looked first at [male] and then at [male] .
his lodging consisted of one large low ceiled room , singularly bare of furniture . for besides a couple of wooden chairs , a couch which served for dreaming on both by day and night . and a great press of [male] oak . there was very little in the room that could be called furniture , but curious instruments were heaped in the corners . and in one stood a skeleton , half leaning against the wall .
`` who has dared , '' he said , laying his hands upon the austrian standard . and speaking in a voice like the sound which precedes an earthquake -- who has dared to place this paltry rag beside the banner of england ? the archduke wanted not personal courage , and it was impossible he could hear this question without reply . yet so much was he troubled and surprised by the unexpected arrival of [male] .
in the mean time , there was before her the terrible necessity of explaining to her husband the step which she had taken without his knowledge . and of which she knew that she must tell him the history before she could sit down to dinner with him in comfort . [female] , she said . creeping in out of her own chamber to his dressing room . while he was washing his hands , you must not be angry with me .
i remained still -- sadder , gladder than i had ever been before . never had i so intensely felt the deep , eternal sorrow of life . that sorrow which can be avoided by none who rightly live ; yet never had life towered before me so rich and so well worth living out . so capable of high exultation , pure purpose . full satisfaction , and sufficient reward , my quarrel with existence was made up .
sadness , uneasiness , anxiety , depression . this fresh misfortune of being forced to flee by night , to seek a chance refuge in [location] for cosette and himself . the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the child . all this , without his being aware of it , had altered [male] walk . and impressed on his bearing such senility , that the police themselves .
we drew our horses up and listened , through the thickness of the air . and with our hands laid to our ears , at first there was nothing to hear . except the panting of the horses and the trickle of the eaving drops from our head covers and clothing . and the soft sounds of the lonely night , that make [male] feel . and try not to think , then there came a mellow noise , very low and mournsome .
in addition to the foregoing semi official particulars , there followed much information that had been gleaned by various reporters . most of the papers gave a leader , and several hinted at the hidden hand . urging that this new outrage obviously pointed to the necessity for the internment of all aliens . great emphasis was laid upon the importance of tracing the present whereabouts of [male] dene of [location] . and anyone who had seen a man at all answering to his description .
from the station at ely , grey sent a message by the wires up to [male] vavasor . saying that he would call on him that afternoon at his office in chancery lane . the chances were always much against finding mr vavasor at his office . but on this occasion the telegram did reach him there . and he remained till the unaccustomed hour of half past four to meet the man who was to have been his son in law .
always , have i noticed , with all the alacrity of which they are capable . do they respond to any order to shorten down , that is why they are for'ard . in that pigsty of a forecastle , because they lack the iron . well , i can say only this : if nothing else could have prevented the funk hinted at by [male] . the sorry spectacle of these ironless , spineless creatures was sufficient safeguard .
no , he went on talking to her , till his words cut my heart like a knife . i axed th nurse to find out who she was . and where she lived , but what i am more especial naming it now for is this . for one thing i wanted you all to know why i were not at my post this morning . for another , i wish to say , that i , for one , ha seen enough of what comes of attacking knob sticks .
[female] had dropped her work out of her hand and looked up . there is often something maternal even in a girlish love , and [female] 's hard experience had wrought her nature to an impressibility very different from that hard slight thing which we call girlishness . at [female] 's last words she felt an instantaneous pang . something like what a mother feels at the imagined sobs or cries of her naughty truant child . which may lose itself and get harm , and when , looking up , her eyes met his dull despairing glance .
valentine , so please my lord , i might not be admitted . but from her handmaid do return this answer : the element itself . till seven years heat , shall not behold her face at ample view . but , like a cloistress , she will veiled walk and water once a day her chamber round with eye offending brine . all this to season a brother 's dead love .
the house of the ship owner to whom he was apprenticed was his home and that of his companions during the idle season between october and march . the domestic position of these boys varied according to the premium paid . some took rank with the sons of the family . others were considered as little better than servants , yet once on board an equality prevailed . in which , if any claimed superiority , it was the bravest and brightest , after a certain number of voyages the monkshaven lad would rise by degrees to be captain .
`` who is it ? '' [female] asked , in a whisper of appalling distinctness . [female] frowned angrily , and gave no reply , while the last hymn was being sung . [female] signed to [female] that she wished to leave the chapel . everyone would be aware that she was among price 's creditors . and she feared that if she stayed till the end of the service some chatterer might draw her into a distressing conversation .
but it brought the terror suited to his temperament . he had always been afraid to enjoy today for fear he might not enjoy tomorrow so much . and it was terrifying to feel that his daughter was divested of that safeguard . the very way she sat in that chair showed it . lost in her dream , he had never been lost in a dream himself .
in the space of cropped meadow between the barn and the hedge stood a man and a woman , both young . the man was a well set up , comely fellow , with a fine head of chestnut hair tied in a queue by a broad bow of [male] satin . he was dressed with certain tawdry attempts at ostentatious embellishments . which did not prepossess one at first glance in his favour , his coat of a fashionable cut was of faded plum coloured velvet edged with silver lace . whose glory had long since departed , he affected ruffles .
i wondered where they got the word . but there was no time to cipher on philological matters , because the whole knight errantry hive was just humming now . and my prospect for trade could not have been better , the moment my lasso was released and sir [male] had been assisted to his tent . i hauled in the slack , took my station and began to swing my loop around my head again . i was sure to have use for it as soon as they could elect a successor for sir [male] .
jup , the very man we want . now as a judge of what the public likes are you impressed with my appearance as father of the gods , thes . yes , you see you are so much out of repair . no , you do not come up to my idea of the part . bless you , i have played you often , thes .
but this was not all ; she very ingeniously managed another thing herself . for she got a young gentleman , who as a relation . and was indeed a married man , to come and visit her two or three times a week in a very fine chariot and good liveries . and her two agents , and i also , presently spread a report all over . that this gentleman came to court her ; that he was a gentleman of a #
it 's [male] 's own fault . then , i imagine , said mr. [male] . laying his hand on the head which had drooped lower and lower , until at last it rested heavily on his knee . [female] made no reply ; but when she lifted up her head there was something so sad in the expression of her face that mr. [female] immediately surmised that there was . or had been , something between [male] and [male] more serious than a mere flirtation .
cecilia then , casting her eyes around , saw that he was followed by sir [male] . full of displeasure both at this introduction and at his presence . she turned hastily to mr arnott , and entreated him to enquire if the carriage was not yet ready . sir [female] , looking at her with all the exultation of new raised vanity . said , with more softness than he had ever before addressed her .
he passed on and ascended the stairs , still holding my hand . and still beckoning the gentlemen to follow him , which they did . we mounted the first staircase , passed up the gallery . proceeded to the third storey : the low , [male] door . opened by mr. [male] 's master key .
i do not see but i must , and leave the consequences to the lord as marmee used to say when she had to decide , and only saw a step of the road . i should enjoy it immensely , if i could only feel that the life would not hurt my girl . and leave her unsatisfied when it was too late to change ; for nothing is harder to give up than the excitements of that profession . i know something of it .
so that we are all in a flutter about getting things . mamma did talk of going up to town . but i believe they have things now quite as good at hereford . [female] , when she was married , had all her things from [location] . but they say that there has been a great change since that , i am sure that i think that you may get anything you want at muddocks and cramble 's .
among the groups which flocked towards the family vault . chateau renaud recognized [male] , who had come alone in a cabriolet , and walked silently along the path bordered with yew trees . `` you here ? '' said chateau renaud , passing his arms through the young captain 's . are you a friend of villefort 's ? how is it that i have never met you at his house ?
they gradually came to talking more frequently of matters outside their love . and in the letters that emma wrote him she spoke of flowers . verses , the moon and the stars . naive resources of a waning passion striving to keep itself alive by all external aids . she was constantly promising herself a profound felicity on her next journey .
she was as severe upon any dereliction from duty as ever . and the hardness of her general demeanor was not a whit relaxed . indeed , sometimes [female] found herself glancing up furtively from her tasks . to look at the thin , sharp face , and wondering if she had not dreamed that her arms had clasped a throbbing . shaken form , when they faced together the ghost of long dead love .
and certainly , just then , [female] was looking very amiable indeed , the look was transient . nothing , she reflected , could undo what the duke had done . that hateful , impudent girl would take good care that every one should know , he put them in with his own hands . ', her ear rings ! he kissed me in the public street . he loved me ... well , he had called out [male] !
owen had followed her , and in a moment the three reappeared . and the party went out on the terrace , the deep blue purity of the night was unveiled by mist . and the moonlight rimmed the edges of the trees with a silver blur and blanched to unnatural whiteness the statues against their walls of shade . darrow and [female] , with [organization] between them . strolled to the farther corner of the terrace .
oh , if he had but said it more tenderly , but he delivered it with the quiet resolution of a man who contends for an abstract principle of justice . and not for a passion grown into the fibres of his heart ! `` you are generous too , '' she faltered , her voice trembling a little , amherst frowned . and she perceived that any hint , on her part . of recognizing the slightest change in their relations was still like pressure on a painful bruise .
with this he sent the chair clattering down the steps . where it struck jules chauvenet 's legs with a force that carried him howling lustily backward to the second landing . armitage turned and sped down the front stairway , hearing renewed clamor from the rear and cries of rage and pain from the second story . in fumbling for the front door he found a hat . and , having lost his own , placed it upon his head , drew his inverness about his shoulders .
[female] came forwards to meet her friend . whom she half expected , and whose step she knew . mrs. [female] returned to her washing . the two girls did not speak ; the presence of [female] awed them into silence . there she lay with the [female] colour .
but [female] 's laugh rang true . as she raised a soapy hand to heaven and swore that never . nowhere and nohow , would she again fall in love with any of the [female] family . down to its remotest collaterals , the friendship between [female] and mrs. [female] . which was to develop so -- quickly and with such strange results , may perhaps have had its beginnings at speyer .
`` as he pleases , '' returned miss march , a slight reserve tempering her [female] manner . but it soon vanished , and she began talking to me in her usual friendly way . asking me many questions about the brithwoods and about [female] bury . i answered them freely -- my only reservation being . that i took care not to give any information concerning ourselves .
oak then left him , he was uneasy on [male] 's account . for he saw anew that this constant passion of the farmer made him not the man he once had been . as [male] continued awhile in his room alone . ready and dressed to receive his company -- the mood of anxiety about his appearance seemed to pass away . and to be succeeded by a deep solemnity , he looked out of the window .
she used to relate her love affairs to [female] in the quiet summer evenings . as the two sat under an old cedar in the meadow nearest the house . a meadow which had been a lawn in the days when the grange was in the occupation of great folks . and was divided from a broad terrace walk at the back of the house by a dry grass grown moat . with steep sloping banks , upon which there was a wealth of primroses and violets in the early spring .
the narrative commenced by a description of a saxon peasant 's hut . situated within the confines of a great , leafless , winter forest . it represented an evening in december . flakes of snow were falling , and the herdsman foretold a heavy storm . he summoned his wife to aid him in collecting their flock .
the door opened , revealing the one armed proprietor entering the house . revealing a group of men and women . bare headed , as they had rushed to the hotel at the sound of the shooting . revealing [male] coming down the steps , his box of chewing gum under his arm . wood fastened the door back in its accustomed anchorage .
again they waited , [female] realized that mrs. [female] was not listening . and would have to be recalled if the bird sang , [female] sat silent . the same bird sang , and others . but to the girl had come the intuition that mrs. [female] was having her hour in the garden . so wisely she remained silent , after an interminable time she arose .
again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something . but [female] interrupted her , [male] spoke rapidly and with animation . he glanced once at the companion 's face . saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him , and , as often happens when one is talking . felt somehow that this companion in the [male] dress was a good .
taking nothing by this movement , i was forced . much against my will , to venture to the door and knock . in a hesitating manner , not being sure but what my answer might be the mouth of a carbine . however it was not so , for i heard a pattering of feet and a whispering going on . and then a shrill voice through the keyhole .
on the following day was the funeral , and [male] went with his father and cousins to the child 's grave . when he met sir hugh in the dining room in the great house the baronet hardly spoke to him . `` a sad occasion ; is it not ? '' said [male] . `` very sad ; very sad , '' then [male] could see that hugh scowled at his brother angrily . hating his humbug , and hating it the more because in [male] 's case it was doubly humbug .
mrs. [female] , no , dearest : it would be quite proper . say on a canal barge ; but it would not be proper for her at a garden party , mrs. [female] , quite so . i know all about that : it 's an excellent arrangement . but where does this girl live ? pickering [ slowly ] i think i know what you mean , mrs. [female] , [female] . well , dash me if i do , i have had to work at the girl every day for months to get her to her present pitch .
the prices were just setting off for church the next day when mr. [male] appeared again . he came , not to stop , but to join them ; he was asked to go with them to the garrison chapel . which was exactly what he had intended , and they all walked thither together , in chapel they were obliged to divide . but mr. [male] took care not to be divided from the female branch . and after chapel he still continued with them .
jude waited all the evening downstairs . at a very late hour the intelligence was brought to him that a child had been prematurely born . and that it , like the others , was a corpse . they would sit silent , more bodeful of the direct antagonism of things than of their insensate and stolid obstructiveness . vague and quaint imaginings had haunted sue in the days when her intellect scintillated like a star .
two days later came young [male] back with his two men at arms . and with them , bound upon a great horse , was a full fierce and raging knight . red of face , large of body , his clothes all tossed and torn . and his mouth full of dire threatenings against [male] . men made way for them marvelling .
some fair young sage , who had never been known to do a foolish act or say an idle word . sometimes the image of [male] sleaford trembled faintly upon the magic mirror of the young man 's reveries . and he wondered whether , under any combination of circumstances . she would ever arrive at this standard , oh , no , it was impossible . he looked back to the drowsy summer time , and saw her lolling in the garden chair .
we are well aware that this term , [female] , is only properly used when followed by a family name . but we find it thus in the manuscript . and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it . and the stranger , muttering to himself , directed his steps toward the kitchen . in the meantime , the host , who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry .
i bet if you walked into there place an watched them eat theyd raise an awful holler . they make speeches to you that youd get your money back without askin up north . they give you free movies thats so old they look as if they was taken in the rain . it seems like feedin the hippo at the zoo , mable . it dont matter so much as long as theres lots of it .
from early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten o'clock all had been brought into due order . the ranks were drawn up on the vast field , the whole army was extended in three lines . the cavalry in front , behind it the artillery . and behind that again the infantry , a space like a street was left between each two lines of troops . the three parts of that army were sharply distinguished : kutuzov 's fighting army ( with the pavlograds on the right flank of the front ) , .
viewed from [location] there had seemed to be no details , san salvatore from there seemed to be an empty . a delicious blank , yet , after only twenty-four hours of it . she was discovering that it was not a blank at all . and that she was having to ward off as actively as ever , already she had been much stuck to . mrs. [female] had stuck nearly the whole of the day before .
captain [female] was also a miser . he loved gold as none but misers do . to him it was wife . child and heaven all in one , and its chink as he counted it was the sweetest of music . for four years he played his role and continually reaped rich reward .
firmly , but certainly , she ordered jocelyn 's life . realising , with him , that roscarna was worth saving . subsidising , with a careful hand , his attempts to restore the woods and waters . interesting herself in the housing of his tenants . and renewing the connection of roscarna with the parish church of clonderriff .
[male] his head , never saw her . ca not see her now , he leaned far out the window , but the girl had disappeared . and the woman in the doorway had gone in and closed the door . i must have said something , made some sort of sound . for jimmy , turning from the window , looked at me uneasily .
i can not ... talk of it ... any longer , she faltered , letting her tears flow . and turning on him a face of pure womanly weakness . wyant looked at her without answering , did he distrust even these plain physical evidences of exhaustion . or was he merely disappointed in her , as in one whom he had believed to be above the emotional failings of her sex ?
there was nobody in the house but herself . and although this was neither alarming nor unusual , it was unusual -- and miss [organization] considered it alarming . that the sum of five hundred dollar should at that very moment be in the upper right hand drawer of the sideboard . which sum had been up to the previous day safe in the coffers of the millageville bank . but certain unfavourable rumours were in course of circulation about that same institution .
he gave me a long account of some of his adventures . and particularly one when he robbed the west chester coaches near lichfield . when he got a very great booty ; and after that , how he robbed five graziers . in the west , going to burford fair in wiltshire to buy sheep . he told me he got so much money on those two occasions .
she felt as if she should have gone to him both hands held out . full and brimming over with tenderness , and been grateful for every word of precious confidence bestowed on her . yet [male] received his letters with a kind of carelessness . and read them with a strange indifference , while molly sate at her feet . so to speak , looking up with eyes as wistful as a dog 's waiting for crumbs .
eugen was usually prompt enough in all he did , but he laid aside that letter . and proposed in a subdued tone that we should have breakfast . which we had , and still the letter lay unopened . and when breakfast was over he even took up his violin and played runs and shakes and scales . and the air of a drinking song .
let me turn , now , from her to her travelling companions , her husband must engage my attention first . what have i observed in sir [male] , since his return . to improve my opinion of him ? i can hardly say . small vexations and annoyances seem to have beset him since he came back . and no man , under those circumstances , is ever presented at his best , he looks .
he was eager to be gone , as he looked forward to a lively week in carondelet street . mr. [male] gave his wife half of the money which he had brought away from [female] 's hotel the evening before . she liked money as well as most women . and accepted it with no little satisfaction , `` it will buy a handsome wedding present for sister [female] ! '' she exclaimed , smoothing out the bills as she counted them one by one .
so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison , that their noise did not . in general , awake him ; but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties . or whether the noise was really louder than usual , edmond raised his head and listened . it was a continual scratching , as if made by a huge claw . a powerful tooth , or some iron instrument attacking the stones .
lambert made no reply , he seemed to be looking over their heads . back along the road they had come , from the lift of his chin and the set of his close gathered brows . he seemed carelessly indifferent to [male] legal opinion and presence . a little fresh plume of smoke going up from his cigarette as if he breathed into it gently . [female] started forward with impatient exclamation , tossing her head in disdainful defiance of this fence rider 's authority .
seeing this , villain as he was , i offered him first chance . i stretched forth my left hand , as i do to a weaker antagonist . and i let him have the hug of me . but in this i was too generous ; having forgotten my pistol wound , and the cracking of one of my short lower ribs . carver doone caught me round the waist .
`` i must at any rate go out before we are married . '' [female] lowther felt this to be a decision in her favour . to be a decision which for the time made her happy and light hearted , she had so dreaded a positive and permanent separation . that the delay seemed to her to be hardly an evil , [male] sat for some half hour helpless over the fire . and then starting up , snatched his hat , and hurried out of the house .
[female] summed up the list of the stranger 's triumphs . being hurled to the ground with such force , that the blood gushed from his nose and his mouth . and he was borne senseless from the lists . [male] wyvil and [male] martival . the marshals of the field , were the first to offer their congratulations to the [male] .
one dismal morning , late in november , [female] , wearing the old overcoat to keep her from freezing . rode into [location] , armed with instructions from the old lady in [location] . she rode boldly up to a policeman , and showed him the address of the grandmother to whom she had decided to go first . her mother 's mother , he sent her on in the right direction . and in due time with the help of other policemen she reached the right number on [male] street .
yet that council of war in [location] was held under no common circumstances . cowed as rischenheim appeared , they dared not let him out of their sight . rudolf could not leave the room into which sapt had locked him . the king 's absence was to be short , and before he came again rudolf must be gone . rischenheim safely disposed of , and measures taken against the original letter reaching the hands for which the intercepted copy had been destined .
mr pickering did not bolt , claire came towards him . still smiling that pathetic smile , a thrill permeated mr pickering 's entire one hundred and ninety seven pounds . trickling down his spine like hot water and coming out at the soles of his feet . he had forgotten now that he had ever sneered at marriage . it seemed to him now that there was nothing in life to be compared with that beatific state .
at the upper end gushed out a crystal spring , which trickled rather than ran . in a bed of marshy green . the entire length of the valley , disappeared in the rocks at the lower end . and came out no more ; many times alessandro had searched for it lower down . but could find no trace of it , during the summer .
the physician was a tall , thin , young man , with a look of efficiency about him . he looked at the baby carefully , laid his hand upon the tiny forehead . then straightened himself , `` is there any way in which the child 's parents can be found ? '' mr. [male] evidently had told him of the nature of the seizure and the absence of the parents on the way up . `` there is always danger in these cases , '' he returned quietly .
this was not news to rostopchin , he had known that [location] would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day with kutuzov on the poklonny hill but ever since the battle of borodino . for all the generals who came to [location] after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle . and since then the government property had been removed every night . and half the inhabitants had left the city with rostopchin 's own permission . yet all the same this information astonished and irritated the count , coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order from kutuzov .
in the presence of this double secret , marius recoiled . the one , in some sort , reassured him as to the other , god was as visible in this affair as was [male] . god has his instruments , he makes use of the tool which he wills . he is not responsible to men , do we know how god sets about the work ? [male] had labored over cosette , he had .
during the next two years [female] mertoun saw some pretty service and much change of scene . making the `` grand tour , '' as it were , under circumstances more exciting and of more moment to the world at large than is usually the case when a gentleman makes it . he so acquitted himself on several occasions that england heard of him and prophesied that if my lord marlborough 's head were taken off in action there was a younger hero who might fill his place . at the news of each battle , whether it ended in victory or not . old rowe rang the bells at camylott .
then [female] grantly became aware that this must be the squire , and he was annoyed with himself for his own awkwardness in having thus come upon the house . he would have wished to keep himself altogether unseen if it had been possible . and especially unseen by this old gentleman , to whom , now that he had met him . he was almost bound to introduce himself , but he was not absolutely bound to do so . and he determined that he would still keep his [male] .
today i had on my spectacles . her appearance , therefore , was clear to me at the first glance . i had not to puzzle over it , she looked young . yet , had i been required to name her exact age , i should have been somewhat nonplussed . the slightness of her figure might have suited seventeen .
yet it was she , dressed in a new gown which he did not know . made since he had left , all the others let him go . and he ran to her , when they met , she fell on his breast , sobbing . she could not lift her face , but only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar 's jacket . denisov , who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone .
gladly would [male] now have taken [male] to his arms . it was no longer anything that from boyhood he had vowed rather to die unmarried . and let the land go to a stranger , than marry a widow . he had to recall every restraining fact of his and her position to prevent him from now precipitating that which he had before too long delayed . but the gulf of the grave and the jealousy of a mother were between them .
so it happened one day that he wanted a particular coat which had been put away in her clothes closet . and she was on her knees between him and it . with the time of her amen quite indefinite , i was sent . said my errand briefly , and was permitted to fumble out her keys from her pocket while she continued to kneel over her morning psalms . what i brought to him turned out to be the wrong coat : i went back and knocked for readmittance .
but as lord wilmore , in the character of the count 's enemy . was less restrained in his answers , they were more numerous ; he described the youth of monte cristo . who he said , at ten years of age . entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of [location] who make war on the english . it was there wilmore had first met him and fought against him .
but he was very kind , he gave her the best things at the table . he had a bottle of slightly sweet , delicious golden wine brought out for dinner . knowing she would prefer it to the burgundy . she felt herself esteemed , needed almost , as they took coffee in the library . there was a soft , very soft knocking at the door , he started .
i am one of them , lord toll . i am the other , phyl , oh , then , my [male] , my own ! well , have you settled which it 's to be ? lord toll , not altogether . it 's a difficult position , it would be hardly delicate to toss up . on the whole we would rather leave it to you , phyl .
she walked by [female] 's side . quite ignored , until she was accosted by [female] parsons . they were passing by the mission tent . and [female] was calling upon the folk to leave the ways of [male] for those of [male] . [male] was about to answer some brutal insult ; but seeing that `` the [male] ''
if he wished to take advantage of the low water . it was important to make haste , the weather continued to be fine and calm . the insolent sea was for a while in a gentle mood . [male] descended , put on his shoes again , unmoored the cable . re embarked , and pushed out into the water , he used the oars .
the show of fat beasts in [location] took place this year on the twentieth day of december . and i have always understood that a certain bullock exhibited by lord [female] guest was declared by the metropolitan butchers to have realised all the possible excellences of breeding . feeding , and condition , no doubt the butchers of the next half-century will have learned much better . and the guestwick beast , could it be embalmed and then produced . would excite only ridicule at the agricultural ignorance of the present age .
so it was settled that mr. [male] should remain in mr. [male] 's family during the winter . to [female] this arrangement gave secret satisfaction . she had from the first liked mr. [male] , and the idea of having him near her all the time was perfectly delightful . she resolved to gain his good opinion , cost what it would . to do this , she knew she must appear to be amiable , and that she determined to do .
for a long time she loitered on the bridge . thinking of all these things , and thinking very little of how she was to go back to graybridge . where her absence must have created some alarm by this time . she had often kept the surgeon waiting for his dinner before today . but she had never been absent when he ate it .
she went to the galleries and palaces . she looked at the pictures and statues that had hitherto been great names to her . and exchanged for a knowledge which was sometimes a limitation a presentiment which proved usually to have been a blank . she performed all those acts of mental prostration in which . on a first visit to [location] , youth and enthusiasm so freely indulge .
one can but see , he remarked , adding , as ibsen says . `` things happen , ' '' he was itching to talk about books and make the most of his romantic hour . minute after minute slipped away , while the ladies . with imperfect skill , discussed the subject of reinsurance or praised their anonymous friend . [male] grew annoyed -- perhaps rightly , he made vague remarks about not being one of those who minded their affairs being talked over by others .
[male] turned the faucet and marched up the stairs with head high and shoulders square . his face was grave while he worked , but peaches was so happy she did not notice . when he came with her supper she kissed the doll . then insisted on [male] kissing it also , such was the state of his subjugation he commenced with `` aw ! '' and ended by doing as he was told , he even helped lay the doll beside peaches exactly as her fancy dictated .
amid the powder smoke , slowly dispersing over the whole space through which [female] rode . horses and men were lying in pools of blood . singly or in heaps , neither [male] nor any of his generals had ever before seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area . the roar of guns , that had not ceased for ten hours . wearied the ear and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle .
he would show them all at the board that he scorned them . and could be their master , then , too , as he was making some other resolves as to his future conduct . he made one or two resolutions respecting the [male] courcy people . he would make it known to them that he was not going to be their very humble servant . he would speak out his mind with considerable plainness .
hearing these terrible remarks , i received an awful presentiment ... i too had once rung at the monster 's door ... and , without knowing it . must have set some warning current in motion , and i remembered the two arms that had emerged from the inky waters ... what poor wretch had strayed to that shore this time ? who was `` the other one , '' the one whose requiem we now heard sung ?
she lost sight of him for months afterwards . and only heard from him once , a whisper passed among the elder collegians that he had been seen at a mock auction in [location] . pretending to buy plated articles for massive silver , and paying for them with the greatest liberality in bank notes . but it never reached her ears . one evening she was alone at work -- standing up at the window .
on the second morning afterwards the air was quiet and full of the odour of seaweed . the sky was round as the inside of a shell . and pale pink like the shadow of flame . the water was smooth and silent ; the hills had lost the memory of the storm . and land and sea lay like a sleeping child .
this i set down to the workings of remorse in a disordered mind and to clouds of venomous insects perpetually shrilling in my ears and stabbing me with their small , fiery needles . not only was i pursued by phantom savages and pierced by phantom arrows . but the creations of the indian imagination had now become as real to me as anything in nature . i was persecuted by that superhuman man eating monster supposed to be the guardian of the forest . in dark , silent places he is lying in wait for me .
by [organization] , each standing on one of the springs of the trap . they pressed them down sufficiently to insert across the jaws a billet which they dragged from a faggot near at hand . and it was then possible to extract the silk mouthful from the monster 's bite . creased and pierced with many holes , but not torn , [female] assisted her to put it on again . and when her customary contours were thus restored they walked on together , [male] taking his arm .
so lady caroline was our guest for the day . a novel guest -- but she made herself at once familiar and [female] . guy , a little gentleman from his cradle . installed himself her admiring knight attendant everywhere . [female] brought her to see his pigeons .
lorna was moved with equal longing towards the country and country ways . and she spoke quite as much of the glistening dew as she did of the smell of our oven . and here let me mention -- although the two are quite distinct and different -- that both the dew and the bread of exmoor may be sought . whether high or low , but never found elsewhere , the dew is so crisp . and pure , and pearly , and in such abundance ; and the bread is so sweet .
princess [female] drubetskaya . who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room . helped to receive and entertain the visitors , the young people were in one of the inner rooms . not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors . the count met the guests and saw them off .
this great day , in which such vast interests of heart and fortune were decided . caused but one anxiety to the master of the hunt . namely , whether or not the stag would cross the pond and be killed on the lawn before the house . for huntsmen of his calibre are like great chess players who can predict a checkmate under certain circumstances . the happy old man succeeded to the height of his wishes .
he had come from lady [female] , and had been specially ordered to go in a cab and come back in a cab . and make himself as like a mercury , with wings to his feet . as may be possible to a [location] footman , mr [male] had arranged his plans with his wife that morning . or , i should more correctly say , had given her his orders , and she . in consequence , had sent away her mercury in hot pressing haste to queen [female] .
if the facts which the `` english gentleman in the greek military service '' ( life , writings , etc. , of lord [female] . 1825 , i , 191 201 ) gives in detail with regard to the sources of the corsair are not wholly imaginary . it is possible that the original [male] 's determination to `` quit so horrible a mode of life '' and return to civilization may have suggested to [male] the possible adventures and fate of a grand seigneur who had played the pirate in his time .
now the time drew nigh which had been foretold by [male] , before he had been snared by a greater wizardry than his . and buried alive beneath the great stone in the forest of broceliande . he had prophesied that , with the coming of king [male] . the island of [location] should grow in strength and fame . and her knights should be more valiant and more pure in word and deed than the knights of any other land .
while leading the way upstairs , she recommended that i should hide the candle . and not make a noise ; for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in . and never let anybody lodge there willingly , i asked the reason . she did not know , she answered : she had only lived there a year or two . and they had so many queer goings on , she could not begin to be curious .
two days later he came again , he brought a newspaper . and what was better , a letter for [male] , franked by the first lieutenant of the victory . `` then he 's aboard her , '' said [female] . as she eagerly took the letter , it was short . but as much as she could expect in the circumstances , and informed them that the captain had been as good as his word .
the first three weeks of [male] 's stay in [location] were . as we have learned , spent at the house of [male] . his mother was present , and although she readily acknowledged the uncommon beauty of her fair visitor . yet from the first she disliked her , the servants . too , as if adopting the opinion of their [female] , felt and expressed among themselves an aversion to the `` evil eyed lady , ''
edna pontellier , casting her eyes about , had finally kept them at rest upon the sea . the day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the blue sky went . there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the horizon , a lateen sail was visible in the direction of cat island . and others to the south seemed almost motionless in the far distance . `` of whom -- of what are you thinking ? '' asked adele of her companion .
to noble , suffering at every pore , this was less a song than a bellowing . and in truth the confident mr. [male] did `` let his voice out , '' for he was seldom more exhilarated than when he shook the ceiling . the volume of sound he released upon his climaxes was impressive . and the way he slid up to them had a great effect .
`` she does it always , '' said an admiring lady in an audible whisper from the other side of miss [female] . `` she does it always , '' the admiring lady was the wife of a retired coachbuilder . who was painfully anxious to make her way into good evangelical society at littlebath . `` perhaps you will put in the sugar for yourself , '' said mrs stumfold to miss mackenzie as soon as she returned .
then , as the soft voice crooned on to lull the weary woman to a fitful sleep . emil for a little while forgot his burden in a dream of plumfield . he saw them all , heard the familiar voices . felt the grip of welcoming hands , and seemed to say to himself . `` well , they shall not be ashamed of me if i never see them any more . ''
a book lay spread on the sill before her . and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals . i believe [female] had laid it there . for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading . or occupation of any kind , and he would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her amusement .
the hymn being rehearsed , or rather half chanted , in a little singing voice , [female] would take exceptions at the manner . and proceed to give a lesson in recitation , she was quick in learning . apt in imitating ; and , besides , her pleasure was to please [female] . she proved a ready scholar , to the hymn would succeed some reading . perhaps a chapter in the bible ; correction was seldom required here , for the child could read any simple narrative chapter very well .
sancho , finding himself so unexpectedly assailed , and hearing the abuse poured upon him . seized the pack saddle with one hand , and with the other gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood . the barber , however , was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made in the pack saddle . on the contrary , he raised such an outcry that everyone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant . `` here , in the name of the king and justice ! ''
the squire had never been very fond of any of the [male] guest family . and had , perhaps , liked lady [male] the least of them all , he was wont to call her a meddling old woman . remembering her bitterness and pride in those now long bygone days in which the gallant [male] had run off with lady [male] . when he first received this letter , he did not . on the first reading of it , believe a word of its contents .
mr.clair had delivered his last and deadliest blow and it found ranald 's heart . but with pain blanching his cheek ranald stood up determined to end the fight . it was by no means easy for him to strike . before him he saw not this man with his ingenious and specious pleading . it would not have been a difficult matter to have brushed him aside .
at that moment , a terrible clap of thunder seemed to burst in the very room beside them . and ere cosmo could repeat the blow , he fell senseless on the hearth . when he came to himself , he found that the lady and the mirror had both disappeared . he was seized with a brain fever . which kept him to his couch for weeks .
but no , he never mentions them , we should not have known why he came to england this time . after a shorter interval than usual , or that he had valuables in his possession . if it had not been for this burglary , as he was obliged to talk to the police . and describe to them what had been stolen from him ( i forgot to mention that he as well as mrs. [female] was robbed . but you would have guessed that , from my beginning , even if you have not read the morning papers before taking up my letter ) .
when sir [male] paid his visit to sir [male] the days of [male] were filled with carking care . the night before he arrived , [male] [female] called her to her closet and laid upon her her commands in her own high way . she was under her woman 's hands . and while her great mantle of [female] hair fell over the back of her chair and lay on the floor . her tirewoman passing the brush over it , lock by lock .
at length he turned to the lamp and looked at his watch . to his surprise it was nearly a quarter past midnight . he now wished that he had driven up the circuitous road to mistover . a plan not adopted because of the enormous length of the route in proportion to that of the pedestrian 's path down the open hillside . and the consequent increase of labour for the horse .
to the german surgeon , as being certainly a foreigner and a stranger . and possibly a quack , to the slur implied on british surgery by bringing the foreigner to dimchurch . to the expense involved in the same proceeding , finally to the whole scope and object of mr. [male] proposal . which had for its origin rebellion against the decrees of an all wise providence . and for its result the disturbance of his daughter 's mind --
hang him , he said it was the twenty first ! it made me turn cold to hear him . i begged him not to make any mistake about it . but he was sure ; he knew it was the 21st . so , that feather headed boy had botched things again , the time of the day was right for the eclipse .
one morning i found the abbe serapion in my room . [male] had advised him that i was ill . and he had come with all speed to see me . although this haste on his part testified to an affectionate interest in me . yet his visit did not cause me the pleasure which it should have done .
then leslie took leave of the others , returned to the cabin . and hurried to her room to dress for her trip to bring her lover . [female] was waiting when she stopped at the iriquois and his greeting was joyous . mr. [male] was cordial , but [male] noticed that he seemed tired and worried . and inquired if he were working unusually hard , he replied that he was .
when [male] showed him the photographs which she had to copy in colors he thundered in his disdain ( oh , how amused she was at his comical fury ! ) at these heads of imbeciles , frozen in solemn smiles . that the dear eyes of his [female] should have to apply themselves to reproducing and her hands to tracing the pictures of these mugs seemed to him a profanation . no , it was too revolting , copies from the museums were more worth while . but one could not count on them any more , the last museums had shut their doors and no longer interested her clients .
some seven men form an association ( if possible , all peers and baronets ) . the start off with a public declaration to what extent they mean to pay their debts . that 's called their capital ; if they are wary they will not quote it at a sum immense . the figure 's immaterial -- it may vary from eighteen million down to eighteenpence . i should put it rather low ; the good sense of doing so will be evident at once to any debtor .
the country was thriving under the coalition , and there was no real reason why it should not last for the next ten years . he continued , therefore , his system of coddling . and was ready at any moment , or at every moment , to pour , if not comfort . at any rate consolation into the ears of his unhappy friend . in the present emergency , it was the falsehood and general baseness of sir [male] which nearly broke the heart of the prime minister .
it was not only , as [male] put it . that [male] was `` singled out as an expiatory sacrifice '' by the british public in a periodical fit of morality . but , as the extent and the limitations of the attack reveal . occasion was taken by political adversaries to inflict punishment for an outrage on popular sentiment .
i saw nothing more of any one until tea time . when mrs. [female] and the governess came in together . something in their manner struck me . one being subdued and gentle , the other tender and kind , both , however , were exceedingly grave . nay , sad , but it appeared to be that sadness which is received as inevitable .
while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties , -- wretched waking dreams of grief . the first rays of morning pierced his windows . and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence . it was just five o'clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear . he turned his head , looked around him .
we started off -- four in a taxi , it was mr. [male] who . with florid politeness , handed eve to her seat . and it was mr. [female] who entertained [female] on the way with light conversation . luigi 's face , when he met the parkers and myself at the entrance of the restaurant . was a study , his polite bow and smile of welcome seemed suddenly frozen on his face as his eyes fell upon mr. [male] .
once , as the two , riding a little apart , turned suddenly together , up a ravine into thicker woods . they came upon a herd of deer . who stared on them without any movement that the eye could see . here a stag stood with two hinds beside him . behind , robin saw the backs and heads of others that lay still .
now mr , [male] and miss lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of [male] baldovinetti . was he a cause of the renaissance . or was he one of its manifestations ? the other carriage was left behind . as the pace increased to a gallop the large , slumbering form of mr. [male] was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine , `` piano , piano ! '' said he , with a martyred look at [male] .
she made breakfast for the lonely squire . and would willingly have carried up madam 's , but that daily piece of work belonged to the squire . and was jealously guarded by him , she read the smaller print of the newspapers aloud to him . city articles , money and corn markets included . she strolled about the gardens with him .
her voice was plaintive , remorse smote wally , it occurred to him that he had not been sufficiently sympathetic . not a word had he said on the subject of her change of fortunes . he had just stood and gaped and asked questions , after all , what the devil did it matter how she came to be here ? he had anticipated a long and tedious search for her through the labyrinth of [location] . and here fate had brought her to his very door .
when the young ladies next met , they had a far more interesting subject to discuss . [male] second letter was then received , and the kind intentions of his father fully explained . a living , of which mr. [male] was himself patron and incumbent . of about four hundred pounds yearly value , was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it . no trifling deduction from the family income .
upon the very eve of that welcome morning which was to set all the guns in midlandshire popping at those innocent red breasted victims . [male] received a letter from his old friend and comrade . mr. [male] , who wrote in very high spirits . and with a great many blots , mr. [male] arrived at warncliffe by an early train next morning . and came on to graybridge in an omnibus , which was quite spiky with guns .
mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite . and on the present occasion , receiving her in that house , there was particular attention . the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic . and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn . that captain wentworth had been in [location] yesterday .
[female] did start for hampshire early the next morning by the same train in which [female] had travelled after her grandfather 's death . it was still quite early in the day when he found himself at malsham . that quiet comfortable little market town where he had first discovered a clue to the abode of his lost love . he went to the hotel , and hired a fly to take him to [male] . where he left the vehicle at the old inn .
lord dawlish looked unhappy , but said nothing . this matter of mr breitstein had been touched upon by claire in previous conversations . and it was a subject for which he had little liking . experience had taught him that none of the arguments which seemed so conclusive to him . to wit , that the financier had on two occasions only just escaped imprisonment for fraud .
in astonishment [female] looked at me , then turned away , i had told her i could not stay . i had not intended to stay , but i could not talk to [female] to night . there would not be time and there was too much i wanted to say , [male] 's shoulders made shrug that was barely perceptible . and without offering his hand he said good night . in the hall i heard him speak to [male] .
as i was about to unfold these projects at breakfast . a telegram was handed to me , i read it . and while bacon plates were being exchanged for dishes of marmalade . i cudgelled my brain like a slave to make it rearrange the whole programme without a hitch . of course , being conductor of a tour .
presently , lord dreever 's name came up , it caused a momentary pause . and mceachern took advantage of it , it was the cue for which he had been waiting . he hesitated for a moment , for the conversation was about to enter upon a difficult phase . and he was not quite sure of himself , then , he took the plunge . `` i have just been talking to sir [male] , my dear , '' he said .
if the speaker 's concluding instance hardly produced the effect she had intended . it was perhaps only because [female] 's attention had been arrested by the earlier part of the argument . it was strange to have marriage urged on her by a woman who had twice failed to find happiness in it . strange , and yet how vivid a sign that , even to a nature absorbed in its personal demands . not happiness but completeness is the inmost craving !
i may be weary of all this bitter movement of a labouring ship on a frigid sea . but at the same time i do not mind it . in my brain burns the flame of a great discovery and a great achievement . i have found what makes all the books go glimmering ; i have achieved what my very philosophy tells me is the greatest achievement a man can make . i have found the love of woman .
the little matter that mr. [male] had to attend to took him up the old stone staircase ( part of the house was very old ) . and made him pause before a door at which he knocked gently . `` come in , '' said a woman 's voice , and he entered a room so darkened by blinds and curtains that miss [female] . the thin middle-aged lady standing by the bedside . would not have had light enough for any other sort of work than the knitting which lay on the little table near her .
in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives , and [female] continued her walk alone . crossing field after field at a quick pace . jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity . and finding herself at last within view of the house .
a threat was contained in this sentence , and joan knew . without asking , what the threat was , in the course of his professional life . which now extended over six or seven years , [male] had saved , perhaps , three or four hundred pounds . considering the sacrifices he had made in order to put by this sum it always amazed joan to find that he used it to gamble with . buying shares and selling them again , increasing it sometimes .
the dusk of evening was falling as we were ferried across to the city . i bade [female] good-bye , and took a cab direct to my rooms . for i was weary in body and spirit . but a bath and dinner improved both , and at eight o'clock i was ringing at mr. [male] 's door . for i knew how anxious he would be to hear my story , and besides .
`` the house is on fire , '' i exclaimed . [female] dropped her knife and turned pale . `` do not wake mother , '' was all she said , as she snatched a bucket of water from the table . the ladder was still lying by the well , in a second i had raised it to the roof and . while [female] went up it like a squirrel and dashed the water on the flames .
it was a wretched place ; one small room . walled with poorly made adobe bricks , thatched with tule . no floor , and only one window , when [male] heard ramona say cheerily . `` oh , this will do very well , when it is repaired a little , '' his face was convulsed , and he turned away ; but he said nothing .
a momentary silence as i raised myself . trembling , and stood aside ; and the water rushed , and the storm birds on untiring wing beat the sky and croaked of the gale . then he drew me to him . folded me to his breast without speaking . and gave me a long , tender , yearning kiss .
[male] had first known [male] at his club . where [male] then knew nobody but the man who made them known to one another . who seemed to be the most intimate friend he had in the world . and whom he had known two days -- the bond of union between their souls . the nefarious conduct of the committee respecting the cookery of a fillet of veal .
cecilia , to whom he grew daily more disagreeable , coldly declined his assistance . while she readily accepted that which had first been offered her by mr [male] . the haughty baronet , extremely nettled , forced his way on , and rudely stalking up to mr [male] . motioned with his hand for room to pass him . and said , `` make way , sir , '' `` make way for me , sir ! ''
then we knew what we must do , our discovery is too great for [male] to waste our time in sweeping streets . we must not keep our secret to ourselves , nor buried under the ground . we must bring it into the sight of all men . we need all our time , we need the work rooms of the home of the scholars . we want the help of our brother scholars and their wisdom joined to ours .
[organization] felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions ', example . he assumed his costume , and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face . their toilet finished , they descended ; the carriage awaited them at the door . filled with sweetmeats and bouquets , they fell into the line of carriages . it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place .
sudden and utter silence followed that exhortation , [female] listened in relieved amazement . [female] caught her breath in sheer dismay . what could he mean , then ? had he but fooled and duped her ? were his intentions towards her the very opposite to his protestations ? she leant upon the poop rail straining to catch every syllable of that speech of his in the lingua franca . hoping almost that her indifferent knowledge of it had led her into error on the score of what he had said .
she might have changed her mind had she seen me fly to my room as soon as she was safely out of sight . lock the door , and bury my face in the pillows . that neither my mother in law nor [female] should hear the sobs i could not repress . of course i knew better than to believe the statement of the elopement . i had seen and heard enough of village life to realize how the slightest circumstance was magnified by the community loafers .
there was a fourth and most original figure in the patriarchal tent , who also appeared before dinner . this was an amazing little old woman , with a face like a staring wooden doll too cheap for expression . and a stiff yellow wig perched unevenly on the top of her head . as if the child who owned the doll had driven a tack through it anywhere . so that it only got fastened on , another remarkable thing in this little old woman was .
but in this case the prince possessed an intellect . in addition to his few square miles of territory . and to one of the most beautiful field marshal 's uniforms that had ever encased a royal warrior . the prince was not a warrior , however ; he was stooping . pacific and spectacled , and his possession of the uniform had been revealed to mrs. [male] only by the gift of a full length photograph in a bond street frame .
they left the farm and wandered on the high road until a stile leading to a cornfield beguiled and then delayed their steps . the silence of the moonlight was clear and immense ; and they listened to the trilling of the nightingale in the copse hard by . first they sought to discover the brown bird in the branches of the poor hedge . and then the reason of the extraordinary emotion in their hearts . it seemed that all life was beating in that moment .
they were a small party for so long a journey . the three with four servants -- two men and two maids . the men had ridden armed , as the custom was . one rode in front , then came the two ladies with [male] . then the two maids , and behind them the second man .
he denounced the most terrible judgments upon [female] . and calling for madame [female] menon . charged her with having insulted her holy religion , in being accessary to the flight of [female] . madame endured these reproaches with calm dignity . and preserved a steady silence , but she secretly determined to leave the monastery .
the bridal trousseau must be produced by [female] courcy 's means . and , therefore , it was necessary that the countess herself should come upon the scene . `` i will have no bills , d 'ye hear ? '' snarled the earl , gnashing and snapping upon his words with one specially ugly [male] tooth . `` i wo not have any bills about this affair , '' and yet he made no offer of ready money .
you can always cure a man of love sickness with `` mental suggestion '' merely by suggesting to him that the girl is trying to marry him . marriage is the operation by which a woman 's vanity and a man 's egotism are extracted without an anaesthetic . jealousy is the false alarm that wakes [female] up from love 's young dream . the most successful men are not those who have been inspired by a wise woman 's love .
there she was , the child who had gone out of the number of our children . our earthly children -- for ever , her mother sat down at the side of the bed . her father at its foot , looking at her . lord ravenel stood by , motionless . then stooping down , he kissed the small marble hand , and he left the room abruptly .
hence he and delight moved in a dream . the full beauty of which they alone sensed , their secret was all the more delicious for being a secret . and with all life before them they agreed they could afford to wait . nevertheless concealment was at variance with the character of either . and although they derived a certain exhilaration from their clandestine happiness they longed for the time when their path should lie entirely in the open .
but to resume , it is the first day of june . ten days have passed since the pampero , when the strong back on number three hatch was repaired captain west came back on the wind . hove to , and rode out the gale , since then , in calm . and fog , and damp , and storm . we have won south until to day we are almost abreast of the falklands .
but in the stress of this ordeal , [male] too lost his hold on the outer , daily life . that which was much to him , came to mean nothing , work , pleasure . it was all left behind , he went on more or less mechanically with his business . but this activity was all extraneous , the real activity was this ghastly wrestling for death in his own soul . and his own will should triumph , come what might , he would not bow down or submit or acknowledge a master .
i judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen . and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements ; for he wore at least four mourning rings . besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it . i noticed , too , that several rings and seals hung at his watch chain . as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends .
it was at that moment that the stage was suddenly plunged in darkness . it happened so quickly that the spectators hardly had time to utter a sound of stupefaction . for the gas at once lit up the stage again , but christine daae was no longer there ! what had become of her ? what was that miracle ? all exchanged glances without understanding . and the excitement at once reached its height , nor was the tension any less great on the stage itself .
then he whistled to the dog , which had been watching him from the hearthrug . and went out of the house , the handle of the whip dragged after him along the floor . mrs. [female] , full of trouble . took [female] to her room , would she not eat her supper ? then salts were good for headache should she bring a bottle from her box ?
mr. and mrs. spalding were covered with glory on the occasion . and perhaps they did not bear their glory as meekly as they should have done . mrs. spalding laid herself open to some ridicule from the british minister 's wife because of her inability to understand with absolute clearness the condition of her niece 's husband in respect to his late and future seat in parliament . to the fact of his being a commoner and a nobleman at the same time . and to certain information which was conveyed to her , surely in a most unnecessary manner .
[male] was not a self starter in the motordrome of love . he needed cranking , he was that most unpromising of matrimonial material . a shy man with a cautious disposition , if he overcame his shyness . caution applied the foot brake , if he succeeded in forgetting caution . shyness shut off the gas , at reigelheimer 's some miracle had made him not only reckless but un self conscious .
`` that seems to me a great shame , but she 's an old brick , '' said [male] , rising from his chair , and pulling [male] 's head backward to kiss her . [female] colored and laughed , but could not conceal that the tears were coming , [male] , looking on over his spectacles . with the angles of his eyebrows falling , had an expression of mingled delight and sorrow as he returned to the opening of his letter . and even mrs. [female] , her lips curling with a calm contentment .
but he had scarce taken half a dozen steps when he heard other steps . and saw that the girl had left her companion and was hurrying toward him . he drew back close into the shadow of the rock to avoid possible discovery . and the girl passed through the moonlight almost within arm 's reach of him . at that moment his heart ceased to beat , he choked back the groaning cry that rose to his lips .
five minutes after , the superintendent was flying along the road to [location] . during this time , [female] desired to be shown the chamber in which [male] was sleeping . at the door of [male] 's cabinet he was folded in the arms of [male] . who had just heard of his arrival , and had left his office to see him . [male] received , with that friendly dignity which he knew so well how to assume .
[female] felt that he could not , with good breeding , detain the count any longer . and , therefore , rising from his chair , led the way into the smoking room . when there , the man of the world separated himself from his young friend . of whose enthusiasm he had perhaps had enough . and was soon engaged in conversation with sundry other men of his own standing .
with a little chuckle of amusement not altogether devoid of a very definite consciousness of being teased . [male] spread all the articles out on the bed spread before him and tried to piece them together like the fragments of any other jig saw puzzle . was the young lady as intellectual as the [female] browning poems suggested . or did she mean simply to imply that she wished she were ? and did the tom boyish sling shot fit by any possible chance with the dainty .
[female] started at this declaration , and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into . in speaking of him , she felt that [male] stood very high in her opinion . she believed the regard to be mutual ; but she required greater certainty of it to make marianne 's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her . she knew that what marianne and her mother conjectured one moment . they believed the next -- that with them , to wish was to hope , and to hope was to expect .
by the time he had finished his theatrical toilet . he had definitely decided that this was the only thing to be done , his plan was simple . he knew where the money was , in the dressing table in sir [male] 's room . he had heard saunders instructed to put it there . what could be easier than to go and get it ? everything was in his favor .
that night after dinner the music was already sounding in the ball room of the great hotel adjacent to the palm gardens when mrs. [female] found [female] smoking on one of the verandas with [male] by his side . the latter was in white satin and white slippers . her hair lying a heavy , enticing mass about her forehead and ears . [female] was brooding over the history of [location] . its successive tides or waves of rather weak bodied people .
what vain weathercocks we are , i , who had determined to hold myself independent of all social intercourse . and thanked my stars that , at length , i had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable . i , weak wretch , after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude . was finally compelled to strike my colours ; and under pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment . i desired mrs. [female] .
there were only five , at a round table , and it was very [female] indeed . they had so many places and people to recall . and they were all so easy and cheerful together ( [male] either sitting out like an amused spectator at cards . or coming in with some shrewd little experiences of his own , when it happened to be to the purpose ) . that they might have been together twenty times , and not have known so much of one another .
is he a ghoul or a vampire ? ', i mused . i had read of such hideous incarnate demons . and then i set myself to reflect how i had tended him in infancy . and watched him grow to youth , and followed him almost through his whole course . and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of horror .
miss [female] was obliged to tell him that there could not possibly be any other answer given to him at any future time than that which she gave him now . he suggested that perhaps he might be allowed to try again when the first month or two of her grief for her brother should be over . but she assured him that it would be useless . at the moment of her conference with him . she did this with all her energy ; and then , as soon as she was alone .
[female] could not contradict her , it was appalling to see her quietly moving forward with her plans . not bitter or excitable , neither asserting innocence nor confessing guilt . merely desiring freedom and the company of those who would not blame her . she had been through -- how much ? [female] did not know , but it was enough to part her from old habits as well as old friends . `` tell me about yourself , '' said [female] .
by ten o'clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the battery . two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around . but the men in the battery seemed not to notice this , and [male] voices and jokes were heard on all sides . `` a live one , '' shouted a man as a whistling shell approached . `` not this way , to the infantry , '' added another with loud laughter .
her binding proceeds with clock like monotony , from the sheaf last finished she draws a handful of ears . patting their tips with her left palm to bring them even . then , stooping low , she moves forward , gathering the corn with both hands against her knees . and pushing her left gloved hand under the bundle to meet the right on the other side . holding the corn in an embrace like that of a lover .
mrs. [female] , in the midnight conference . intimated rather yearningly that , however the event might have turned , the side of english life such experiences opened to milly were just those she herself seemed `` booked '' . as they were all , roundabout her now , always saying -- to miss : she had begun to have a little . for her fellow observer , these moments of fanciful reaction . reaction in which she was once more all [female] shepherd .
mr. [male] left them soon after breakfast . the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before . and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon . convinced as [female] now was that miss [female] 's dislike of her had originated in jealousy . she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her .
i happened to be standing by the hearth , looking into the dying fire . while the nurse was speaking , not a vestige of oscar 's letter to me was to be seen . in my position , the plain conclusion was that i had really done what i supposed myself to have done . that is to say , thrown the letter into the flames , entering lucilla 's room . soon afterwards , to make my apologies for having forgotten to wait and take her letter to the post .
he had an opportunity of talking confidentially to clarissa once after dinner . when mr. [male] , who had not fairly finished his nap in the railway carriage . had retired to a dusky corner of the drawing room and sunk anew into slumber . and when miss [female] seemed closely occupied in the manufacture of an embroidered pincushion for a fancy fair . absorbing as the manipulation of chenille and beads might be .
monte cristo had promised him that [male] should live , and so far he had always fulfilled his word . every night the count had given him news . which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier , still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him . and he called a second and third time ; still no answer . then he determined to go up , noirtier 's room was opened .
lord [male] came on christmas eve . and was received with open arms by his sister , and with that painful , irritating affection which such a girl as violet can show to such a man as lord [male] . when she will not give him that other affection for which his heart is panting . the two men were civil to each other , -- but very cold , they called each other [male] and [male] . but even that was not done without an effort , on the christmas morning mr. [male] asked his brother in law to go to church .
that lord elmwood could have no idea what the real petition was . which rushbrook meant to present him is certain ; but it is certain he expected he had some request to make . with which it might be wrong for him to comply , and therefore he avoided hearing what it was . for great as his compassion for him was in his present state . it was not of sufficient force to urge him to give a promise he did not mean to perform .
when she became quite unmanageable , and vehemently abused him to his face . our good grosse used to swear at her , in a compound bad language of his own . with a tremendous aspiration at the beginning of it . which always set matters right by making her laugh , i see him again as i write . leaving the room on these occasions , with his eyes blazing through his spectacles .
`` you had not spoken of leaving [female] before , '' the regret in tollman 's voice was sincere . because it was the regret of a trapper who sees game slipping away from the snare . and it made him perhaps a shade over insistent . `` do you really regard it as so important ? '' for just an instant a gleam of anger showed in the visitor 's eyes under this questioning . and his glance , leveled straight at his host .
`` yes , please , '' i answered , and he turned away to his desk of clicking instruments without looking at me again . it seemed wise to establish relations with the post office . so i made myself known to the girl who stood at the delivery window . [organization] had himself given me this information . but the girl seemed to find pleasure in imparting it with a certain severity .
she enjoyed the feeling of the thick carpet underfoot . she looked lingeringly at the pictures on the wall . occasionally she put a finger to touch a vase as if by that she made its preciousness more her own . her spirit , i could see , was as deeply concerned about [female] as was mine . but she had such faith in life that she retained serenity enough to enjoy what beauty she came across in her period of waiting .
the captives had not long enjoyed their refreshment , however , ere their attention was [male] even from this most serious occupation by the blast of a horn winded before the gate . it was repeated three times , with as much violence as if it had been blown before an enchanted castle by the destined knight . at whose summons halls and towers . barbican and battlement , were to roll off like a morning vapour . the saxons started from the table , and hastened to the window .
she did not move at darrow 's approach . but lifted to him a deep gaze of [male] and confidence . the look seemed to throw about him the spell of a divine security . he felt the joy of a convalescent suddenly waking to find the sunlight on his face . madame [male] chantelle .
in repose they looked at each other with the toleration they might have felt for broken old chairs . [male] worried a little when he was sick and did her best to be cheerful under the wearying depression of living with a disappointed man . family bridge was over for the evening and she sighed with relief . she had made more mistakes than usual this evening and she did not care . [male] should not have made that remark about the infantry being particularly dangerous .
they led me , starting from the left hand side of the boat house . along the edge of the trees , a distance . i should think , of between two and three hundred yards , and then the sandy ground showed no further trace of them . feeling that the persons whose course i was tracking must necessarily have entered the plantation at this point . i entered it too , at first i could find no path .
and for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was essential to put an end to this false position . and the sooner the better , throw up everything , she and i . and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love , he said to himself . hoping to find her alone , vronsky alighted , as he always did , to avoid attracting attention . before crossing the bridge , and walked to the house , he did not go up the steps to the street door .
what would it become him to do in this emergency if crosbie had truly been guilty of the villainy with which lady [male] had charged him ? thirty years ago he would have called the man out . and shot at him till one of them was hit . nowadays it was hardly possible for a man to do that . and yet what would the world say of him if he allowed such an injury as this to pass without vengeance ?
the proclamation was ready , we hastened into the street . we said nothing to madame petöfi . every one of [male] had arms of some sort . i pocketed the famous duplex pistol already mentioned , every one knows ad nauseam what followed . how the human avalanche began to move , how it grew , and what speeches we made in the great square .
others might bewail the family misfortune . the family triumph filled the secret mind of mrs. [female] . to the exclusion of every other earthly consideration , i put my finger in as instructed . and got instantly bitten by the ferocious baby , but for a new outburst of the rector 's voice at the moment . mrs. [female] ( if i am any judge of physiognomy ) .
it lies in the fact that an historic character like [female] i . standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of history focused upon him . a character exposed to those strongest of all influences : the intrigues . flattery , and self deception inseparable from power . a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in [location] .
no , no , the father of the marshalsea was supposed to know nothing about the matter . of course : his poor dignity could not see so low , but he took the cigars . on sundays , and was glad to get them ; and sometimes even condescended to walk up and down the yard with the donor . and benignantly to smoke one in his society , with no less readiness and condescension did he receive attentions from [male] senior . who always relinquished his arm chair and newspaper to him .
the duke took off his hat , standing before her foolishly dumb between his disappointment and embarrassment . he had counted so fully on finding the girl of his romance that he was reluctant to accept the testimony of his eyes . here was one charming enough to compensate a man for a hundred fasts and fevers . but she was not the lodestone that had drawn upon his heart with that impelling force which could not be denied . what a stupid blunder his impetuous conclusion had led him into .
the two great doctors came , and the two great doctors pocketed their hundred guinea fees and went . but neither the one nor the other , nor eke the twain , would commit themselves to a fixed opinion as to [male] 's chances of life or death . however , one of them picked out a number of shot from the wounded man . and a number more he left in because he could not pick them out . then they both agreed that the treatment of their local brethren was all that could be desired .
i began to say what was in my mind to [female] when she came in . but she moved past me , remote in preoccupation . and i was silent when i saw that she was dressed in all respects like a bride . the gown she wore on her wedding day ten years ago had been cut and embroidered as this white satin was . her hair had been coiled low on her neck , as it was now .
the train consisted of a string of freight cars . one coach divided half and half between baggage and smoker . and a day car occupied by two silent . awkward women and a child , in the smoker lounged a dozen men . they were of various sizes and descriptions .
this lady was mrs. [female] , a widow of limited means . and a distant relation of [female] 's , left quite alone after her husband 's death . and feeling herself thoroughly helpless , [female] had summoned this experienced matron to her aid . whereupon mrs. [female] had given up a small establishment in the far north of [location] . which she was in the habit of speaking about on occasions as her humble dwelling .
[female] went through her task mechanically , the glow of strength and courage remained . steeling her to bear what had broken down miss [female] 's professional fortitude , but when she sat down by the bed [female] 's moaning began to wear on her . it was no longer the utterance of human pain . but the monotonous whimper of an animal -- the kind of sound that a compassionate hand would instinctively crush into silence . but her hand had other duties ; she must keep watch on pulse and heart .
`` you do not look it , '' commented [male] , smiling . he was pleased to see her again , for they had been good friends . she liked him still -- that was evident , and he truly liked her , [female] smiled . she was glad to see this old friend of [female] 's . this woman , trailing a magnificent yellow lace train over pale .
but shadows are there , and light is here , we are not acquainted with the maladies of these ancient civilizations . we do not know the infirmities of our own , everywhere upon it we have the right of light . we contemplate its beauties , we lay bare its defects . where it is ill , we probe ; and the sickness once diagnosed . the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy .
having filled both glasses , she raised her own . and said , with a graceful bow , `` your health , mademoiselle , '' and after taking a sip she turned to [female] . repeating , `` your health , [female] , '' whereupon the old woman curtsied wonderfully low considering her stiff knees . at first the visitor did not seem to care for the idea , but when the [female] with her suggested it was too hot to walk about .
and so saying he gave [male] the spur . and [male] followed him on foot and loaded . and after having partly made the circuit of the mountain they found lying in a ravine . dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by jackdaws . a mule saddled and bridled , all which still further strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the mule and the saddle pad .
the gulls had gone to rest , the sea almost so , for the ground swell only washed the island 's sandy shore and idly rocked the sloop as she rode secure at anchor . the moon and the man in it both smiled . and when [male] and [male] , wearied of singing . lived over once more the battle scenes they had passed through , feeling that never again could they or would they be called upon to face such danger . it may be said that they were as near contentment as often comes in life .
college hill , parnassus , and old [male] swarmed with cheery faces . as guests , students , and professors hurried to and fro in the [male] excitement of arriving and receiving . everyone was welcomed cordially , whether he rolled up in a fine carriage . or trudged afoot to see the good son or daughter come to honour on the happy day that rewarded many a mutual sacrifice . mr laurie and his wife were on the reception committee .
the wish was rather eager than lasting , he was roused from the reverie of retrospection and regret produced by it . by some inquiry from [male] as to his plans for the next day 's hunting . and he found it was as well to be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command . in one respect it was better , as it gave him the means of conferring a kindness where he wished to oblige . with spirits , courage , and curiosity up to anything .
your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry . firmness , and expedition , i consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate by me . on kutuzov 's staff , among his fellow officers and in the army generally . prince [male] had , as he had had in petersburg society . two quite opposite reputations , some , a minority , acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else .
when imogene returned home she told mrs. [female] that she had accepted this invitation . mrs. [female] said nothing . but when one of the young men came up to hand imogene down to the carriage . which was waiting with the others at the gate , she could not have shown a greater tolerance of his second rate new yorkiness if she had been a [male] dowager offering him the scrupulous hospitalities of her city . imogene came in at midnight ; she hummed an air of the opera as she took off her wraps and ornaments in her room .
for several hours , javert had ceased to be simple , he was troubled . that brain , so limpid in its blindness , had lost its transparency . that crystal was clouded , javert felt duty divided within his conscience . and he could not conceal the fact from himself . when he had so unexpectedly encountered [male] on the banks of the seine .
from sixteen year old otis ormonde , who has two more years at hill school . to g. reece stoddard , over whose bureau at home hangs a harvard law diploma . from little madeleine hogue , whose hair still feels strange and uncomfortable on top of her head . to bessie macrae , who has been the life of the party a little too long . more than ten years -- the medley is not only the centre of the stage but contains the only people capable of getting an unobstructed view of it .
and suddenly the rabbit , which had been crouching as if it were a flower . so still and soft , suddenly burst into life , round and round the court it went . as if shot from a gun , round and round like a furry meteorite . in a tense hard circle that seemed to bind their brains , they all stood in amazement . smiling uncannily , as if the rabbit were obeying some unknown incantation , round and round it flew .
but then a love letter is a love letter , and this was the first miss sleaford had ever received . [female] 's tone of mingled doubt and supplication was by no means displeasing to her . it was only right that he should be miserable : it was only proper that he should be tormented by all manner of apprehensions . they would have to quarrel by and by , and to bid each other an eternal farewell . and to burn each other 's letters , and be reconciled again , the quietest story could not be made out without such legitimate incidents in the course of the three volumes .
i can not make any apology for him . upon my life i can not , said [male] . if i know what it is for a man to behave ill . falsely , like a knave in such matters , he is so behaving . so [male] spoke as he took his candle to go away to his work .
mr. [male] had come in very late , and was having a solitary dinner in the dining room . molly was sitting near him to keep him company . [female] and her mother were upstairs . the latter was trying on a head dress which [female] had made for her . molly remained downstairs after her father had gone out afresh on his final round among his town patients .
at last that noble creature came into the dining room in a flannel gown and list shoes . but with his cravat on , and a chief [male] all over , it was morning now . physician had opened the shutters of one window while waiting . that he might see the light , mrs [female] 's maid must be called . and told to get mrs [female] up , and prepare her as gently as she can to see me .
the man was in no hurry , and struck again with the flint and steel . as the sparks fell thick and bright about him , i could see his hands . and touches of his face , and could make out that he was seated and bending over the table . but nothing more , presently i saw his blue lips again , breathing on the tinder . and then a flare of light flashed up , and showed me orlick .
yet to this day there are moments when it comes into my mind . and involuntarily i ask myself , `` what if it were true ? '' it 's absurd , but it has on one or two occasions nearly affected my conduct . and yet i was not an impressionable ignorant young girl . i had taken the exact measure of the fellow 's utter worthlessness long before .
business and pleasure -- but only on the surface . underneath was a dogged and obstinate determination to make up as soon as possible for the humiliation of the early days of the war . those were the transition days in england . the people were slowly awaking to the magnitude of the thing that was happening to them . certain elements of the press , long under political dominion .
during the latter part of that night and most of the day , it rained . a fine , slow , quiet rain , with no wind to shake the wet from burdened leaf or blade . but when the old shepherd left the cave by a narrow opening on the side of the mountain . near sammy 's lookout , the sky was clear . the mists rolled heavily over the valley , but the last of the sunlight was warm on the knobs and ridges .
the virtuous ironmonger , with the richly dowered daughter . existed only in his prolific brain -- the need of money was growing pressing . he had done much , but there was still much to do , and he must make haste to do it . he had also been mistaken on one point of much importance to his success . he had not calculated on the strength of [male] constitution .
there was no knowing where any of those temecula people were now , they had scattered `` like a flock of ducks , '' one indian said , -- like a flock of ducks after they are fired into . you would never see all those ducks in any one place again . the temecula people were here , there , and everywhere , all through san [male] county . there was one temecula man at san [male] capistrano , however .
suddenly she heard amherst 's step in the passage . heard him laughing and talking as he chased cicely up the stairs to the nursery . why , the answer to that was simple enough , she had not told him because she was not afraid . from the first she had retained sufficient detachment to view her act impartially . to find it completely justified by circumstances , and to decide that , since those circumstances could be but partly and indirectly known to her husband .
trevelyan had not given any direct answer to that question about [male] rowley 's maintenance . but he was quite prepared to bear all necessary expense in that direction . at any rate till sir [male] should have arrived . at first there had been an idea that the two sisters should go to the house of their aunt , mrs. [female] . mrs. [female] was the wife .
the next day i dressed up again , but in quite different clothes . and walked the same way again , but nothing offered till i came intojames 's park . where i saw abundance of fine ladies in the park . walking in the mall , and among the rest there was a little miss . a young lady of about twelve or thirteen years old .
the captain 's ten or twelve hours of daily work was performed . no doubt , at irregular intervals , -- some days late and some days early . for he might be seen about norwich almost at all times , during the early part of that november . and he might be very often seen going into the close , in norwich there are two weekly market days . but on those days the captain was no doubt kept more entirely to his military employment .
all these questions were asked among ourselves , and to some of them we obtained answers at the next dorcas meeting . which was held at the vicarage , mr. [male] montfort was not a regular actor now . he had been , but he now taught elocution and deportment . and had been introduced to the vicar by a brother clergyman in [location] much interested in the union of church and stage . his credentials were undoubted , but it was feared he was poor .
on that side there was no protection but the breakwater . a breakwater is an apparatus for dividing and distributing , it requires at least two frames . [male] had only had time to construct one , he was compelled to build the second in the very presence of the [male] . fortunately the wind came from the north west , the wind is not always adroit in its attacks . the north west wind , which is the ancient `` galerno , '' had little effect upon the douvres .
he remembered the shabby untidy bungalow in new hampshire . the slatternly servants , uneatable food and ubiquitous children . how could he ask susy to share such a life with him ? if he did , she would probably have the sense to refuse . their alliance had been based on a moment 's midsummer madness .
mceachern did not answer , an hour before , he would have fought to the last ditch for his belief in [male] 's crookedness . but the events of the last ten minutes had shaken him . he could not forget that it was [male] who had extricated him from a very uncomfortable position . he saw now that that position was not so bad as it had seemed at the time . for the establishing of the innocence of mr. [male] could have been effected on the morrow by an exchange of telegrams between the castle and [male] 's private inquiry agency .
what a mate for a man , and she had looked at him pridefully . they were married before the ship was loaded , and on a knoll of the logged over lands back of the town and commanding a view of the bay . with the dark forested hills in back and the little second growth redwoods flourishing in the front yard . he built her the finest home in sequoia . he had reserved this building site in a vague hope that some day he might utilize it for this very purpose .
in serving writs i made such a name that an articled clerk i soon became . i wore clean collars and a brand-new suit for the pass examination at the institute . and that pass examination did so well for me . that now i am the ruler of the queen 's navee , of legal knowledge i acquired such a grip that they took me into the partnership . and that junior partnership , i ween .
long live brutus , he has slain , there lies the virtue . virtue , granted , but madness also , there are queer spots on those great men . the brutus who killed [male] was in love with the statue of a little boy . this statue was from the hand of the greek sculptor strongylion . who also carved that figure of an amazon known as the beautiful leg .
milady , on the contrary , was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues , amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years . she made it her business . therefore , to amuse the good abbess with the worldly practices of the court of [location] . mixed with the eccentric pursuits of the king ; she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the lords and ladies of the court . whom the abbess knew perfectly by name , touched lightly on the amours of the queen and the duke of [female] .
hence he determined to abandon himself to the stream of feeling . and perhaps was surprised to find what an exceedingly shallow rill it was , as in droughty regions baptism by immersion could only be performed symbolically . mr. [male] found that sprinkling was the utmost approach to a plunge which his stream would afford him . and he concluded that the poets had much exaggerated the force of masculine passion . nevertheless , he observed with pleasure that miss [female] showed an ardent submissive affection which promised to fulfil his most agreeable previsions of marriage .
suppose this hall to be shut off by a curtain seven feet in height . of which we have already spoken ; in the shadow of that curtain . pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir on the left . the school girls on the right , the lay sisters and the novices at the bottom . and you will have some idea of the nuns of the petit picpus assisting at divine service .
i have not altered the spelling , i love it too well . prophetic of a fault i still carry about me . how strange that little bit of invocation to the dear folk above sounds to me now ! my mother must have been teaching me things after her own persuasion . most naturally , poor dear one -- though that too has gone like water off my mind .
he called the messenger in , after some little stay . and asked him where the person was who gave him the letter . the messenger told him the place . which was about seven miles off , so he bid him stay . and ordering a horse to be got ready , and two servants , away he came to me with the messenger .
the anticipation in the half breed 's eyes reflected itself for an instant in [male] 's . he turned back into the cabin , bent over his pack . and found among his clothes two pairs of boxing gloves . he fondled them with the loving touch of a brother and comrade . and their velvety smoothness was more soothing to his nerves than the cigar he was smoking .
first , that this was a concerted plan , and not a mere chance arrest . mr. [male] 's message to her showed so much . and the circumstances of topcliffe 's arrival confirmed it . next , it must be more than a simple blow struck at one man . mr. [male] : topcliffe would not have come down from [location] at all unless it were a larger quarry than mr. [male] that was aimed at .
lambert hoped that [female] and young [female] . and the old stub footed scoundrel who was the meanest of them all who had lashed him into the fire that night . would swing the doors of the saloon and come out with a declaration of their intentions . he knew that some of them , if not all , were there , he had tied [male] out before their eyes like wolf bait . let them come and get him if they were men .
but the bulletin which followed entirely changed the face of things . [male] could no longer breathe at all , and could scarcely follow the prayers which the cure of saint nicholas des champs recited near him . the king resumed his agitated walk about his chamber . and consulted , as he walked , several papers drawn from a casket of which he alone had the key . a third time the nurse returned , [male] had just uttered a joke .
`` have you heard from [male] since he has been gone ? '' the old man asked one day , when he had come upon [male] still seated in the parlour in which they had lunched . he had been out , at the front of the house . scolding the under gardener ; but the man had taken away his barrow and left him . and sir [male] had found himself without employment .
nothing would induce lady scatcherd to go to bed . but the two doctors agreed to lie down , each in a room on one side of the patient . how was it possible that anything but good should come to him . being so guarded ? `` he is going on finely , lady scatcherd , quite finely , '' were the last words mr [organization] said as he left the room .
the hour of supper being arrived , we gathered round the table . but the different sensations with which we were agitated left [female] little inclination to eat . and the meal , if such it may be called , passed in silence . [location] was the first to rise ; she went out , and seated herself on the very spot where we now are . [female] hastened after her , and sat down by her side .
gradually , as the time wore along , one annoying fact was borne in upon my understanding . that we were weather bound , an armed novice can not mount his horse without help and plenty of it . sandy was not enough ; not enough for me , anyway , we had to wait until somebody should come along . waiting , in silence , would have been agreeable enough , for i was full of matter for reflection . and wanted to give it a chance to work , i wanted to try and think out how it was that rational or even half rational men could ever have learned to wear armor .
she pushed away my outstretched hand and hurried from the room . and he went out also after bestowing upon me an oath which i could hear him repeat as he sought his hat and cloak in the hall . i stood there without a word , my heart had seemed to drop within me as a coal fire burnt to ashes falls together in a grate . the warmth that kept it alive had gone out suddenly , but it smouldered yet . and when i went to meet her a few evenings afterwards i had determined to gather courage and speak to her once for all .
my godmother lived in a handsome house in the clean and ancient town of [female] . her husband 's family had been residents there for generations . and bore , indeed , the name of their birthplace -- [male] of [male] . whether by coincidence , or because some remote ancestor had been a personage of sufficient importance to leave his name to his neighbourhood . i know not , when i was a girl i went to [female] about twice a year .
was embossed in purple , it was the first note i had received from a woman for a long time . and it gave me a [female] emotion . one of the sisters i had seen beyond the wall undoubtedly wrote it—possibly sister theresa herself . a clever woman , that , thoroughly capable of plucking money from guileless old gentlemen , poor olivia ! born for freedom , but doomed to a pent up existence with a lot of nuns !
`` ramona , '' exclaimed the father , his thin cheeks flushing with pleasure . `` the blessed child , '' and as he spoke , her face came into sight . set in a swaying frame of the blossoms . as she parted them lightly to right and left with her hands . and half crept , half danced through the loop hole openings thus made .
thomasin was so surprised by the explanation that she quite forgot to lecture the girl . who glided silently away , thomasin did not move further than to turn her eyes upon the grass plat where the maypole had stood . she remained thinking , then said to herself that she would not go out that afternoon . but would work hard at the baby 's unfinished lovely plaid frock , cut on the cross in the newest fashion . how she managed to work hard , and yet do no more than she had done at the end of two hours .
at this period of the day susanna was at school . and he was informed that she would not be home till the evening . then he plucked up courage and begged to be allowed to come again , -- just to look in at eight o'clock . so that he might see susanna , he could not go back to [location] comfortably . unless he could give some tidings of susanna to the family in gower street .
soon , following the track of those [female] figures across the snow . we came to a cluster of peat huts . alongside of the moorland road . [male] took one of the carriage lamps in his hand . and went in , without saying a word , to my surprise lord ravenel presently dismounted and followed him .
she laughed ; but i was wondering if i were dull and uninteresting enough to stand a chance . it seemed as if providence were actually handing it to me . but just then [male] and sir [male] came to the doorway which so becomingly framed [male] 's form and mine . naturally that put the idea out of my head ; and two such opportunities do not come to a man in a single night . dinner was not ready yet , and we sauntered about on the flat roof .
as you pass along the road from guestwick into the village you see the church near to you on your left hand . but the house is hidden from the road , as you approach the church . reaching the gate of it which is not above two hundred yards from the high road . you see the full front of the great house . perhaps the best view of it is from the churchyard .
but lady scatcherd was now too much interested in the general tenor of the news which she had heard to care much about the house which she was to inhabit in future . [female] , the heiress of boxall hill ! [female] , the still living child of that poor creature who had so nearly died when they were all afflicted with their early grief , well . there was consolation , there was comfort in this , there were but three people left in the world that she could love . her foster child , [female] -- [female] , and the doctor .
lord [female] remained ten days at saulsby . and at last did not get away without a few unpleasant words with his father . or without a few words that were almost unpleasant with his [male] , on his first arrival he had told his sister that he should go on a certain day . and some intimation to this effect had probably been conveyed to the earl . but when his son told him one evening that the post chaise had been ordered for seven o'clock the next morning .
' god bless you , sir ! cried the grateful old woman , ready to weep for joy as she received her favourite from his arms . `` i can see better here , thank you , [male] , '' replied i , taking my work to the window . where she had the goodness to suffer me to remain unmolested .
beneath our eyes lay the palace gardens . where the torches of the sudanese band glowed like transfixed fireflies . in the pale moon rays , palms and acacias and jewelled flower beds . were cut out sharply in vivid colour by the lights which streamed from open windows . beyond -- past the zone of violet shadow so like a stage background .
before the hunting season was over captain marrable had abandoned his intention of going to [location] . and had made arrangements for serving for awhile with his regiment in [location] . this he did after a discussion of some length with his uncle , sir gregory . during that discussion nothing was said about [male] brownlow . and of course , not a word was said about [male] lowther .
but , [female] 's significant finger again expressing that his post was at the door to keep watch over [male] . now he had found him with so much trouble . and that the duty of his post was to sit on the floor backed up by the door . looking at [male] and holding his own ankles , -- signor [male] once more volunteered . his services being accepted , [male] suffered the door to open barely wide enough to admit of his squeezing himself out .
[female] 's engagement made a great stir in the family a [female] one this time . for nobody objected , everything seemed felicitous , and the course of true love ran very smoothly for the young couple . who promised to remove the only obstacle to their union by growing old and wise as soon as possible . if he had not been so genuinely happy , the little lover 's airs would have been unbearable . for he patronized all mankind in general , his brother and elder cousins in particular .
all her impatience to be at home again now returned ; her mother was dearer to her than ever . dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in willoughby , and she was wildly urgent to be gone . [female] , unable herself to determine whether it were better for marianne to be in [location] or at barton . offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother 's wishes could be known . and at length she obtained her sister 's consent to wait for that knowledge .
she went up the curving stairway . which represented the one attempt at ceremony in the otherwise rather dilapidated mansion . and down a narrow passage until she came to the room whose light she had seen from the garden . knocking , she was told to come in , a young man . [male] , was reading , with his feet on the fender .
`` he shall die , then , since you condemn him ! '' said [male] , in so firm a tone that it appeared to [female] an undoubted proof of devotion . this reassured her , we can not say how long the night seemed to [female] . but [female] believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds . and invaded the chamber with its paleness , seeing [female] about to leave her .
a shout went up from those assembled , a shout of joy . the faces of dangloss and allode were pictures of astonishment and . it must be said -- relief , [male] staggered but recovered himself instantly . and turned his eyes toward [male] , that worthy 's legs trembled and his jaw dropped . `` i have the prisoner , your highness , ''
it had become our special duty to refer to this most discreditable transaction . from the fact that a paper , still in our hands . had been confided to [male] for publication by the wretched husband before his senses had become impaired . which , however , we were debarred from giving to the public by an injunction served upon [male] in sudden haste by the vice chancellor . we are far from imputing evil motives , or even indiscretion .
have you ever looked in the glass ? phyl . no , never , streph . here , look at that , and tell me if you think it rational to expect me to wait two years , phyl , no . you are quite right -- it 's asking too much , one must be reasonable , streph . besides , who knows what will happen in two years ? why , you might fall in love with the lord chancellor himself by that time , phyl , yes . he 's a clean old gentleman , streph . as it is .
he was holding the child gently and stroking her tumbled hair . when he put her from him to see her face . mickey was filled with envy because he had been forced to admit the gift was not from him . he shut his lips tight , but his face was grim as he studied peaches flushed cheeks and wet eyes , and noted the shaking eagerness for the doll she was afraid to look at .
she comforted so many creatures , in strange parts of the town . where no other lady would have dared to go to give alms , it was rumoured that she went and did noble things privately . in dark kennels , where thieves hid and vagrants huddled . she carried her beauty and her stateliness . the which when they shone on the poor rogues and victims housed there seemed like the beams of the warm and golden sun .
he would have been an old gentleman exacerbated by queen victoria 's invincible prejudice against him . her brusque refusal to `` entertain '' lord [male] timid nomination of him for a post in the government ... [male] would have been a poet to the last , but how dull , how very dull . would have been the poetry of his middle age , -- a great unreadable mass interposed between him and us ... did [male] , mused the duke , know what was to be at missolonghi ?
`` i did not behave well to him , '' she said to herself . i never do , i forget how much he is giving up for me . and then , when anything annoys him , i make it worse instead of comforting him . and upon that she made accusation against herself that she did not love him half enough . that she did not let him see how thoroughly and perfectly she loved him .
it certainly was said of her by some persons that there must have been something in her former life of which she was ashamed . the honourable mrs. stantiloup , to whom all the affairs of bowick had been of consequence since her husband had lost his lawsuit . and who had not only heard much , but had inquired far and near about mr. and mrs. [male] . declared diligently among her friends , with many nods and winks . that there was something `` rotten in the state of denmark . ''
so god me help , said sir [male] . wit ye well that i am the same knight . now i have told you my name , tell me yours with good will . wit ye well that my name is sir [male] , and my brother [male] sir blamore [male] . that is called a good knight , and we be sister 's children unto my lord sir [male] lake .
all nature was breakfasting ; creation was at table . this was its hour ; the great blue cloth was spread in the sky . and the great green cloth on earth ; the sun lighted it all up brilliantly . god was serving the universal repast , each creature had his pasture or his mess . the ring dove found his hemp seed , the chaffinch found his millet .
there are those who will for a consideration sail extremely close to the wind . and , in the present state of a fallen world , such people and such steamers have their use . from the hour that the aglaia first entered the clyde . new , shiny , and innocent , with a quart of cheap champagne trickling down her cut water . fate and her owner , who was also her captain .
eustace , who had been listening to the conversation with every muscle tense . in much the same mental attitude as that of a peaceful citizen in a wild west saloon who holds himself in readiness to dive under a table directly the shooting begins . began to relax , what he had shrinkingly anticipated would be the biggest thing since the dempsey carpentier fight seemed to be turning into a [male] social and literary evening not unlike what he imagined a meeting of old girton students must be . for the first time since his mother had come into the room he indulged in the luxury of a deep breath . `` but what are you doing here ? '' asked mrs. [female] .
there was a clumsy low stone portico over the door . wide enough to admit a carriage ; and lounging upon a bench under this stony shelter they found a sleepy looking man servant . who informed captain [male] that sir [male] was at heatherly . but that he was out shooting with his friends at this present moment . in his absence the man would be very happy to show the house to captain [male] and his party .
he learned that all second hand clothes men were sharks . that there was no use in putting the least faith in the protests of any rag dealer or old shoe man . they all lied , they all claimed to be very poor , when as a matter of fact they were actually rolling in wealth . gerhardt had investigated these stories ; he had followed them up . he had seen what they were doing with the things he sold them .
it was wonderful , scrap 's voice . it had given her , in the ten years since she came out . all the triumphs that intelligence and wit can have . because it made whatever she said seem memorable , she ought . with a throat formation like that , to have been a singer .
he acted upon the suggestion ; went to the door of the swinging crocodile . knocked , and knocked again ; had the door opened to him as if in surprise by an apparently sleepy man . announced the motive of his coming as if it were a foregone conclusion that hasheesh could be smoked in that house by the initiated . his disguise was not suspected , it never was , when he played the egyptian . and when asked who had sent him , he had the inspiration to utter the name of that bey who had been [male] 's master .
so [female] took up his abode , full of strenuous -- if vague -- purpose , in the plainly furnished but not uncomfortable cottage known locally as `` the one down by platt 's . '' he might have found a worse billet , it was a two storied building of stained red brick . not one of the thatched nests on which he had looked down from the hill . those were not for rent , being occupied by families whose ancestors had occupied them for generations back . the one down by platt 's was a more modern structure .
i have called her merciless , for she seemed to glory in another 's anguish . counting it fit retribution and a punishment from the lord . yet i trembled to think how more merciless she might have been had she withheld the truth ! it was not until we were back at the office again that either mr. [male] or myself ventured a comment upon this extraordinary story . even then , we found very little to say , nothing could be done to divert the blow .
she had come up to [location] hardly knowing what peril she feared . and still less how she could avert it , if owen meant to see miss viner . and what other object could he have ? -- they must already be together . and it was too late to interfere , it had indeed occurred to [male] that [location] might not be his objective point . that his real purpose in leaving givre without her knowledge had been to follow darrow to [location] and exact the truth of him .
tregear , however , was determined to be active in the matter , to make some effort . to speak to somebody , but how to make an effort , -- and to whom should he speak ? thinking of all this he remembered that mrs. [female] had sent for him and had told him to go with his love story to the duke . she had been almost severe with him ; -- but after the interview was over . he had felt that she had acted well and wisely , he therefore determined that he would go to mrs. [female] .
her duty was to overcome her grief and speak as if the doctors had told him that there was nothing the matter that a little careful nursing would fail to put right . [female] had faith in the warm weather , and she resolved to put her trust in it . it was hard to see him wasting away before her eyes and keep cheerful looks in her face and an accent of cheerfulness in heir voice . the [male] which had come at last seemed to suck up all the life that was in him . he grew paler , and withered like a plant .
away we go to a balmy isle . where the roses blow all the winter while , all , then away we go to an island fair that lies in a southern sea . then away we go to an island fair . then away , then away , then away , scene. -- pavilion in the court of barataria . [male] and giuseppe , magnificently dressed , are seated on two thrones .
the twilight was falling slate blue at the window . she closed her eyes . closed away the monotonous level of dead wonder , and opened them again to the every day world . `` yes , '' she said briefly , regaining her will with a click . she went again to the window , blue evening had fallen over the cradle of snow and over the great pallid slopes .
the gentle girl wondered what she had done to offend her guardian , and then . being unable to think of any possible delinquency by which she might have incurred mrs. [female] 's displeasure . was fain to attribute the change in [location] 's manner to the irritation consequent upon her illness . and was thus more gentle and more submissive than of old ; enduring cruel looks . returning no answer to bitter speeches , but striving to conciliate the supposed invalid by her sweetness and obedience .
this account , which explained the late uneasiness of mrs harrel . still encreased the distress of [female] ; and every moment she obtained for reflection . augmented her reluctance to parting with so large a sum of money for so worthless an object . and added strength to her resentment for the unjustifiable menaces which had extorted from her such a promise . yet not an instant would she listen to mr arnott 's offer of fulfilling her engagement .
kind mrs. [female] . whom we have all too much overlooked and forgotten of late , innocently caused [female] a sad morning to begin with . she has been , for months past , secretly making a warm shetland shawl for her dear pupil . a most beautiful and surprising piece of work to be done by a woman at her age and with her habits . the gift was presented this morning , and poor warm hearted [female] completely broke down when the shawl was put proudly on her shoulders by the loving old friend and guardian of her motherless childhood .
[male] did just that , as a matter of fact . a year or two later ; but stock that has within itself the power of being `` live '' has also rare qualifications for being dead when occasion suits . and it generally did suit [male] 's stock . it proved prone not only to all the general diseases that cattle flesh is heir to . but was capable even of suicide , at least , it is true that two valuable jersey calves .
the commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most cruel and unexpected answer . that there was no answer , she had never felt so humiliated as at the moment when . sending for the commissionaire , she heard from him the exact account of how he had waited . and how afterwards he had been told there was no answer . [female] felt humiliated , insulted , but she saw that from her point of view countess lidia ivanovna was right .
with nations destitute of principle . and princes void of humanity . to this branch of reading he preferred romances . which , being chiefly occupied by the feelings and concerns of men . sometimes represented situations similar to his own , thus , no book gave him so much pleasure as telemachus .
`` brandy and water , '' said lady [male] , crosbie in truth was not given to the drinking of brandy and water . but he was prepared to call for raw gin , if he were driven much further by lady [male] 's solicitude . at these sunday dinners the [male] of the house never went away into the drawing room . and the tea was always brought into them at the table on which they had dined . it was another little step towards keeping holy the first day of the week .
and because he sought so hard to forget her , his fingering of the typewriter keys would fall idle . and his eyes , looking out across the chimney pots , would soar with the circling pigeons . and he would see her again in every guise that he remembered . and he remembered them all , she had been cruel to the point of doing the one thing which he had told her would brand him with the deepest possible misery . and which pledged him in honor not to approach her again by word or letter without permission .
the cry roused him , he opened his eyes . and found cool , gray dawn in the sky . [male] , alert , was muzzling his hand . slim buck lay in the sand , still asleep , there was no stir in the camp . and then , with a sudden catch in his breath , he looked toward yellow bird 's tepee .
there had been a very pretty ending : the squire had shouted for his servants and [male] for his . and the two parties had eyed one another , growling like dogs , until bloodshed seemed imminent . then the visitor had himself solved the situation by stalking out of the house from which the squire was proposing to flog him . mounting his horse , and with a last compliment or two had ridden away , and here he was at froggatt on his return journey . having eaten there that dinner which no longer would be spread for him at matstead .
not many days after [male] funeral was over . all was arranged respecting [male] 's appointment at [location] . and the time was fixed for his sailing , it was to take place almost immediately . yet much remained to be done ; many domestic preparations were to be made ; and one great obstacle . anticipated by both [female] and [female] , to be removed , this was the opposition they expected from mrs. [female] .
to have no work to do was strange , but not half so strange as having glided into a corner where she had no one to think for . nothing to plan and contrive , no cares of others to load herself with . strange as that was , it was far stranger yet to find a space between herself and her father . where others occupied themselves in taking care of him . and where she was never expected to be , at first , this was so much more unlike her old experience than even the mountains themselves .
with such an attitude of mind to satisfy was it a marvel that in the matter of selecting a husband for his divinity willie was difficult to please . or that he studied with a criticism quite as jealous as [female] own every male who crossed the girl 's path ? yet with all his idealism willie was a keen observer of life . and from the first moment of their meeting he had detected in [male] qualities more nearly akin to his standards than he had discovered in any of the other outsiders who had come into the [male] . there was , for example , the son of the farwells who owned the great colonial mansion on the point .
the stranger cast one look around her , to be certain that they were quite alone . then bending as if she would have knelt , and joining her hands , she said with an accent of despair . `` edmond , you will not kill my son ? '' the count retreated a step , uttered a slight exclamation . and let fall the pistol he held , what name did you pronounce then .
from beneath thick shade he should watch the sunlight creeping at his toes . if there be sun of summer , let him not go out into it . mistaking it for the indian summer sun , thus peradventure he shall decline softly . slowly , imperceptibly , until impatient nature clutches his wind pipe and he gasps away to death some early morning before the world is aired . and they put on his tombstone : in the fulness of years ! ', yea !
it had long been customary , as she never changed her room . for those who had anything to say to her apart , to wheel her to her desk . where she sat , usually with the back of her chair turned towards the rest of the room . and the person who talked with her seated in a corner , on a stool which was always set in that place for that purpose . except that it was long since the mother and son had spoken together without the intervention of a third person .
goes out straightway , and , leisurely leaning his arms on the open window of a cab in waiting . looks in at mr dolls : who has brought his own atmosphere with him . and would seem from its odour to have brought it , for convenience of carriage . in a rum cask , after carefully reading the dingy scrap of paper handed to him . and as carefully tucking it into his waistcoat pocket .
[female] looked at her face with surprise . it was the same face he had seen before . there was the same general expression of refined , inner , spiritual labor . but now it was quite differently lit up , there was a pathetic expression of sorrow . prayer , and hope in it .
he poured the contents of the bottle on a piece of paper . which he pressed firmly against the window pane , then , drawing out a short steel instrument . he gave the paper a sharp tap . the glass broke almost inaudibly , the paper came away , leaving a gap in the pane . spike inserted his hand , shot back the catch .
theodore , you , are you going to stand up and tell the world that god has joined those two together , god ? then you will be blaspheming love -- and god who made it . no , you shall not marry us , your love too sacred for the church ? the church has a name for such love ! the world a name for such women !
from a bush a dozen yards away a wondering moose bird had watched the terrible struggle . now he hopped boldly upon jan 's motionless body . and perked his head inquisitively as he examined the strange face . covered with blood and twisted in torture , the gray film of dawn dissolved itself into the white beginning of day . far to the south , a bit of the red sunrise was creeping into the northern world .
this was a very long speech for [male] , it was uttered in little gasps or snatches of speech . the speaker stopping at the end of every sentence to take breath . [male] sat on that side of the comfortable round table most remote from mr. [male] . deadly pale , with her hands clasped before her , once she lifted her eyes with a piteous look to her father 's face . but he was smoking his pipe solemnly , with his gaze fixed upon the blazing logs in the grate .
the ocean defends the water , the hurricane defends the air . the king defends royalty , the democracy defends the people . the relative , which is the monarchy , resists the absolute . which is the republic ; society bleeds in this conflict . but that which constitutes its suffering today will constitute its safety later on .
mr. [male] shook his head with much meaning . he was not going to incur the certainty of being accepted by the woman he would choose . the miss [female] who had the honor of being mr. [female] 's ideal was of course not present . for mr. [male] , always objecting to go too far , would not have chosen that his nieces should meet the daughter of a middlemarch manufacturer . unless it were on a public occasion , the feminine part of the company included none whom [female] or mrs. [female] could object to .
she would carry can after can of water up the long path and never complain of fatigue . she broke into complaint only when miss [female] forgot to feed her pets . of which she had a great number -- rabbits , and cats . and rooks , and all the work devolved upon her . she could not see these poor dumb creatures hungry .
when the dance was over all were invited into the house to dispose of mince pie . cheese , doughnuts and sweet cider . and then , with the moon silvering the autumn landscape . the party separated , as [female] drove along the wooded road conveying liddy to her home . he felt a little curious , he could not quite understand why she had taken pains not to find a red ear .
one morning , very shortly after her return to [female] . lady [male] was told that mr. [male] of [organization] had called . and desired to see her , she suggested that the gentleman had probably asked for her husband . who , at that moment , was enjoying his recovered supremacy in the centre of trumpeton wood . but she was assured that on this occasion mr. [female] 's mission was to herself .
they had evidently come from oued tolga , or at least from that direction . therefore it was probable that their destination was the zaouïa . otherwise , as it was already late , they would have stopped in the city all night . of course , it was possible that they were on their way to the village . but it was a poor place , inhabited by very poor people .
i now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life . which was varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes . by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to miss havisham . i found miss [female] pocket still on duty at the gate . i found miss havisham just as i had left her .
having thus persuaded her , the plan was pursued , and they kept a bee line northward . their long repose at the manor house lent them walking power now . and towards midday they found that they were approaching the steepled city of melchester . which lay directly in their way , he decided to rest her in a clump of trees during the afternoon . and push onward under cover of darkness , at dusk clare purchased food as usual .
mr. [male] directed the whole , officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage . and every body was in good time , emma and [female] went together . miss bates and her niece , with the eltons . the gentlemen on horseback , mrs. [female] remained with mr. [female] . nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there , seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment .
gerald looked at him , and with a slight revulsion saw the human animal . golden skinned and bare , somehow humiliating , halliday was different , he had a rather heavy . slack , broken beauty , white and firm , he was like a [male] in a pieta . the animal was not there at all , only the heavy , broken beauty , and [male] realised how halliday 's eyes were beautiful too . so blue and warm and confused , broken also in their expression , the fireglow fell on his heavy .
hardly more than mention can be made of the important work of this dramatist . poet , novelist , historian , scientist and philosopher . in 1888 he left [location] , as the atmosphere there had become too disagreeable for him through controversy after controversy in which lie became involved . he joined a group of painters and writers of all nationalities in it little village in [location] . there he wrote [male] [location] ,
marius left the hotel [female] [male] porte saint jacques . as he did not wish to run in debt there , life became hard for marius . it was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch . he ate of that terrible , inexpressible thing that is called [male] vache enrage . that is to say , he endured great hardships and privations .
the stately beauty had a softer air , the brightness of the blue eyes was not so cold as it was wont to be . they played chess again , and mr. [male] kept aloof from clarissa , they . walked together in the gardens for a couple of hours next morning . and [male] pressed the question of his marriage with such a show of earnestness and warmth . that geraldine 's rebellious pride was at once solaced and subdued , and she consented to agree to any arrangement he and lady [female] might make .
so impertinent -- and yet the house `` did , '' for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly . other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects . over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously , yet all these suggested the accidental , the temporary . while windy corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of nature 's own creation . one might laugh at the house , but one never shuddered , mr. [male] was bicycling over this monday afternoon with a piece of gossip .
i should be preaching a very stale sermon , and harping upon a very familiar moral . if i were to seize this opportunity of declaiming against art and beauty . because my lady was more wretched in this elegant apartment than many a half starved seamstress in her dreary garret . she was wretched by reason of a wound which lay too deep for the possibility of any solace from such plasters as wealth and luxury . but her wretchedness was of an abnormal nature , and i can see no occasion for seizing upon the fact of her misery as an argument in favor of poverty and discomfort as opposed to opulence .
but if the duke of omnium would have been content to acknowledge that he was not the man to alter the county suffrage . an excuse might have been found that would have been injurious to no one , mr. [male] and mr. [male] might have joined . and the present prime minister might have resigned , explaining that he had done all that he had been appointed to accomplish . he had , however , yielded at once to mr. [male] , and now it was to be feared that [organization] would not accept the bill from his hands . in such a state of things , -- especially after that disagreement about lord earlybird .
mr. [male] pushed it as he spoke . and the two young men went into the front garden , the door of the house . as well as that of the garden , was open , sigismund went into the hall . followed closely by [male] , the parlour door was open too , and the room was empty . the room was empty , and it had an abnormal appearance of tidiness .
as soon as dinner was over the squire announced that he should walk into [male] to inquire how the wounded man was getting on . shortly afterwards he started , leaving his daughter and [female] alone . they went into the drawing room and talked about indifferent things . no word of love passed between them . no word , even , that could bear an affectionate significance , and yet every sentence which passed their lips carried a message with it .
[female] , i have never lowered my position . let any one say , if they can , that the count 's cook has had anything to do with the riding master or the swineherd . let them come and say it , [female] . yes . you happened to get a fine fellow , that was your good luck , [female] . is it for you to say anything .
the dissolution was factious , dishonest , and unconstitutional , so said all the liberals . and it was deduced also that the conservatives were in their hearts as angry as were their opponents . what was to be gained but the poor interval of three months ? there were clever men who suggested that mr. [male] had a scheme in his head . some sharp trick of political conjuring , some `` hocus pocus presto '' sleight of hand , by which he might be able to retain power .
faithfully , at supper time , [male] entered , but he could tell [male] no news . he had kept watch all the time on the staircase by desire of `` mr. [male] '' so he informed me , my father asked no questions . not even about his mill , from his look , sometimes , i fancied he yet beheld in fancy these starving men fighting over the precious food . destroyed so wilfully -- nay , wickedly , heaven forgive me , his son , if i too harshly use the word .
the room had been arranged with a view to the dancing . the large oak table having been moved back till it stood as a breastwork to the fireplace . at each end , behind , and in the chimney corner were grouped the guests . many of them being warm faced and panting , among whom [female] cursorily recognized some well to do persons from beyond the heath . [location] , as she had expected , was not visible , and [female] recollected that a light had shone from an upper window when they were outside .
d'artagnan bowed to the duke , and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside . opposite the tower of [location] he found the vessel that had been named to him . delivered his letter to the captain , who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to sail . the next day about nine o'clock in the morning . he landed atvalery , [male] went instantly in search of the inn .
and yet sir [male] was the most popular man in the county . and no more courteous gentleman ever sat at the bottom of his own table . a mild man he was , too , when out of his saddle . and one by no means disposed to assume special supremacy , but a master of hounds . if he have long held the country , -- and sir [male] had held his for more than thirty years .
mr. [male] was a small , fair haired man . prematurely bald , an indifferent speaker ; but excellent in committee . instinctively he was gentle and kind , mrs. [female] disliked [female] and [female] was indifferent to mrs. [female] . mrs. [female] , however , recognised that in [female] her husband had a remarkably good secretary . one whom it would be difficult to replace , mrs. [female] 's attitude to everyone who was not in a superior position to herself was one of patronage .
with this reflection , [male] took up his pike staff . put on his broad brimmed bonnet , and set forth upon his pilgrimage . the old woman remained for some time standing in a fixed posture . her eyes directed to the door through which her ambassador had departed . the appearance of excitation , which the conversation had occasioned .
indeed , i fear he had by that time begun to feel that the only salvation now open to him must come from the jury 's verdict . if the jury should declare mr. [male] to be guilty , then -- ; he would not say even to himself that in such case all would be right . but he did feel that much as he might regret the fate of the poor crawleys . and of the girl whom in his warmth he had declared to be almost an angel . nevertheless to him personally such a verdict would bring consolatory comfort .
their plan of action was a simple one , they were to lie hidden where they were until the king was in extremis . pia , whose daughter was employed as a still room maid at the palace . would give them information as to the progress of the royal patient . in the mean time pia would see that the little staircase which [female] had used to such good purpose fifteen years before . was free of access , and that the door which gave on to the grounds .
therewith he kneeled down tofore the table and made his prayers . and then suddenly his soul departed to jesu [male] , and a great multitude of angels bare his soul up to heaven . and the two fellows might well behold it , also they saw come from heaven a hand . but they saw not the body ; and it came right to the vessel . and took it , and bare it up to heaven .
we have seen that [female] was prepared to start on his journey in search of the arabins . and have seen him after he had taken farewell of his office and of his master there . previous to his departure ; but that matter of his departure had not been arranged altogether with comfort as far as his official interests were concerned . he had been perhaps a little abrupt in his mode of informing sir [male] buffle that there was a pressing cause for his official absence . and sir [male] had replied to him that no private pressure could be allowed to interfere with his public duties .
vincentio , come hither , you rogue . what , have you forgot me ? biondello . forgot you ! no , sir : i could not forget you . for i never saw you before in all my life , biondello . what . my old worshipful old master ? yes , marry , sir ; see where he looks out of the window .
mrs greaves now brought information , that a chaise was at the door . and that a groom was in readiness , lord [male] timidly offered [male] his hand . which she gracefully accepted ; but neither of them spoke as he led her to the carriage . from all the various sufferings of [female] , through the scenes of this morning . the predominant remaining emotion , was that of pity for her penitent young offender .
those two words , however , had set every one in the convent who had the privilege of speech to chattering . how many things were contained in that ah , auguste ! ', what revelations ! [female] name really was auguste . it was evident that madame albertine belonged to the very highest society . since she knew [female] , and that her own rank there was of the highest .
one crumpled rose leaf [female] josie 's [female] . one baffled wish filled her with a longing which became a mania . and kept her as restless and watchful as a detective with a case to work up ' . [female] , the great actress , had hired one of the villas and retired thither to rest and `` create '' a new part for next season . she saw no one but a friend or two .
she ought not to have been so utterly absorbed in her own affairs that night . she ought to have asked to have the key back , and then to have laid it where it could be found by mrs. [male] in the morning . that message had delighted knight when he heard of it . he had laughed and said , i like those chaps ! they can have my money when they want it !
frank , of course , ran through all his arguments . he would go into a profession , or take a farm and live in it . he would wait ; that is , for a few months , a few months , [male] ! ', said [male] . `` well , perhaps six , '' `` oh , [male] , '' but [male] would not be stopped . he would do anything that his father might ask him .
allow [female] to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron [female] chantal . that the baron [female] chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old . and that this little girl was afterward [female] , [male] sevigne . the comte [male] toiras retired into the citadelmartin with his garrison . and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of [male] pree .
at first she contented herself with gardening . making an aviary , and surrounding herself with all sorts of queer birds and beasts . upon whom she lavished the affection which , of late years . had known no human outlet , but after a while her natural inclination to hospitality . her humorous enjoyment of other people 's foibles .
the confusion became then so great that [male] could no longer distinguish anything . then , from this chaos , suddenly surged something like a visible intention . like a will pronounced , the condemned had been torn from the hands of the guards . and were being dragged towards the house of l'image de notre dame , those who dragged them shouted . `` vive [male] , '' the people hesitated .
she would like the relics of great people better . for i have seen her [male] 's cocked hat and gray coat . his baby 's cradle and his old toothbrush . also [male] little shoe , the ring of saint [male] . charlemagne 's sword , and many other interesting things .
she did not care to offend mrs. [female] . who was socially so much more important than [female] , she came back to where [female] was sitting . smiling apologetically , but she was a little bit flustered , [female] was out of countenance , of course . presently she excused herself and went home . she had been cut deeply by the slight offered her .
as a child in [location] she had looked wonderingly upon the statues of heroes and the frequent military pageants of the capital . and she had wept at the solemn pomp of military funerals . once on a battleship she had thrilled at the salutes of a mighty fleet in the [female] below the tomb of grant . and soon thereafter had felt awe possess her as she gazed upon the white marble effigy of [female] in the chapel at [location] . for the contemplation of heroes was dear to her , and she was proud to believe that her father .
the function for which the senator from [location] provided an invitation for armitage was a large affair in honor of several new ambassadors . at ten o'clock senator [male] was introducing armitage right and left as one of his representative constituents . armitage and he owned adjoining ranches in [location] . and [male] called upon his neighbor to stand up boldly for their state before the minions of effete monarchies . mrs. [female] had asked armitage to return to her for a little [location] talk .
`` i will try , '' said [female] , for the advice suited her . and after a flurry to get ready , she ran after the friends . who were just disappearing over the hill , it was not far to the river . but both were ready before [female] reached them , jo saw her coming . and turned her back , laurie did not see , for he was carefully skating along the shore .
while the deemster was stepping up to the dais , and the people in the court were rising to receive him . a poor bedraggled wayfarer was toiling through the country towards the town . it was a woman , she must have walked far . her step was so slow and so heavy , from time to time she rested . not sitting , but standing by the gates of the fields as she came to them .
he began by refusing absolutely to discuss the merits of the bill . the right honourable gentleman had prided himself on his generosity as a greek . he would remind the right honourable gentleman that presents from greeks had ever been considered dangerous . it is their gifts , and only their gifts . that we fear , he said , the political gifts of the right honourable gentleman .
these two spectres of his existence , his tiger wife and the fair woman who was his wife in name . constantly marched side by side before him . blotting out the beauty from every scene and souring the sweetness of every joy . but if in his pain he thirsted for revenge upon [male] . who would have none of him , how much more did he desire to be avenged upon [male] .
it was a little thing , but if done for effect . it answered admirably , for it showed a quick insight into his character on her part . and betrayed to him the existence of a pride in which he sympathized heartily . he stood by jean a moment . watching her as she burnt [male] 's letter in the blaze of the spirit lamp under the urn .
she confessed that she was not particularly fond of literature . [female] agreed with her that books were tiresome things . only , as he said , you had to read a good many before you found it out . he had been to places that people had written books about . and they were not a bit like the descriptions .
there he sat , surrounded by happy , laughing young men , each grasping a glass of the good old mixture as before . absolutely unable to connect , some of them , casual acquaintances , had nodded to him . waved , and gone on lowering the juice , -- a spectacle which made [male] feel much as the wounded soldier would have felt if sir [male] . instead of offering him the cup of water . had placed it to his own lips and drained it with a careless `` cheerio ! ''
yet he fell to racking his brains to find a means by which the count might be rendered incapable of performing the service so desired by the king and of carrying out his own purpose in seeking an audience . nothing save assassination suggested itself to the constable . a quarrel and a duel offered no security . and sapt was not [male] , and had no band of ruffians to join him in an apparently unprovoked kidnapping of a distinguished nobleman . suddenly the constable bent forward , craning his head out and down , far as he could stretch it .
he went down on his knees and gathered up these remnants and burnt them . with the air of a man destroying the evidences of his guilt . then he put back the ink and the dictionary . the blotting pad and sealing wax . and replaced them with a loaf of bread .
`` what fun , i wish i would brought cicely , i have not coasted for years , '' she laughed out , as the second detachment of boys heaped themselves on another sled and shot down . amherst looked at her with a smile , he saw that every other feeling had vanished in the exhilaration of watching the flight of the sleds . she had forgotten why she had come -- forgotten her distress at his dismissal . forgotten everything but the spell of the long white slope .
she received him with her [male] genial smile . looking exactly as she had looked when he had parted from her on the morning after their ride . she did not show any sign of anger . or even of indifference at his approach , but still it was almost necessary that he should account for his search of her . i have so longed to hear from you how you got on at loughlinter , ', he said .
he was perverse too , he fought her off . he always fought her off , the more she strove to bring him to her . the more he battled her back , and they had been lovers now , for years . oh , it was so wearying , so aching ; she was so tired , but still she believed in herself . she knew he was trying to leave her .
`` thank you , my lord , '' said the boy , and went his way , as happy as a postman . [male] greddon , in the duke 's place . would have taken a pinch of snuff , but he could not have made that gesture with a finer air than the duke gave to its modern equivalent . in the art of taking and lighting a cigarette , there was one man who had no rival in [location] .
silvered is the raven hair , spreading is the parting straight . mottled the complexion fair , halting is the youthful gait . hollow is the laughter free , spectacled the limpid eye . little will be left of me in the coming bye and bye ! little will be left of me in the coming bye and bye !
he was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants hay and corn as of his own , and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested so early and so well . or got so good a return , as did [male] , he disliked having anything to do with the domestic [male] . the `` drones '' as he called them . and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity .
but when she settled down in the house she found it almost impossible to do so . lady scatcherd treated her as a farmer 's wife might have treated some convalescent young lady who had been sent to her charge for a few weeks . in order that she might benefit by the country air . her ladyship could hardly bring herself to sit still and eat her dinner tranquilly in her guest 's presence . and then nothing was good enough for [female] , lady scatcherd besought her .
they were [male] and jeanne ! he caught his breath at what happened then , he saw jeanne falter for a moment . he noticed that she was now dressed like the others about her . and that [female] , who stood at her shoulder . was no longer the fine gentleman of the rock , the half breed bent over her .
mrs. [female] , nevertheless , followed her privately on each occasion when she went to the lake . without , however , venturing near enough to the boat house to be witness of what took place there . when [female] returned for the last time from the dangerous neighbourhood . the fatigue of walking , day after day . distances which were far too great for her strength , added to the exhausting effect of the agitation from which she had suffered .
nevertheless , isolated as he was , we must say that the duke of [male] did not experience an instant of fear . one of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance . brave , rash , and enterprising , this was not the first time he had risked his life in such attempts . he had learned that the pretended message from [male] of [male] . upon the faith of which he had come to [location] .
then she burst out crying afresh ; and when weary of crying , fell to thinking again , the gallows , the gallows ! [female] it stood against the burning light which dazzled her shut eyes . press on them as she would , oh ! she was going mad ; and for awhile she lay outwardly still . but with the pulses careering through her head with wild vehemence .
independently of romantic rubbish , however , that old garden had its charms . on summer mornings i used to rise early , to enjoy them alone . on summer evenings , to linger solitary , to keep tryste with the rising moon . or taste one kiss of the evening breeze . or fancy rather than feel the freshness of dew descending .
but this latter argument , obscuring the majesty of the former , was one too many . for [male] answered contemptuously , `` the more spooneys they ! '' and immediately appealed to his mother whether boys were not better than girls . mrs. [female] pronounced that both were alike naughty , but that boys were undoubtedly stronger . could run faster , and throw with more precision to a greater distance , with this oracular sentence [female] was well satisfied .
towards the middle of november they took up their winter quarters in [female] . not the november of fogs and drizzle . known to the denizens of [location] , but serene skies and balmy air . golden sunsets , and late lingering flowers , that seemed loath to fade and vanish from a scene so beautiful . clarissa loved this city of cities .
whether this was unconscious diplomacy on my part , or not , i should not like to say . but the remark was true enough , and it pleased him extremely . `` it is a collection , '' he said emphatically . only i live right in it , which most collectors do not . but i see that you know what you are looking at , not many people who come here on business do .
her last message to him , her last promise of love and faith until the end of time . but mckay 's mind saw nothing beyond the dimly lighted room of the missioner 's cabin . he pressed his lips to the silken tress of nada 's hair . still damp with the rain ; and after that , with the care of a miser he smoothed it out . and tied the end of the tress tightly with a string .
mr. [male] 's suspicion as to the opiate was true , however . under the first galling pressure of foreseen difficulties , and the first perception that his marriage . if it were not to be a yoked loneliness , must be a state of effort to go on loving without too much care about being loved . he had once or twice tried a dose of opium . but he had no hereditary constitutional craving after such transient escapes from the hauntings of misery .
[female] was by all acknowledged and treated as the [female] , when they played at blind man's buff go where she would . she was always caught ; she was called out repeatedly to do what was required in any game . as if all had a pleasure in seeing her light figure and deft ways . she was sufficiently pleased with this to have got over her shyness with all except [female] . when others paid her their rustic compliments she tossed her head .
i shall wait for a further letter from you before i speak either to my father or to my grandfather . if you can tell me that you accede to my views . i will at once try to bring about a reconciliation between you and the squire . i think that that will be almost easier than inducing my father to look with favour upon our marriage . but i need hardly say that should either one or the other oppose it , -- or should both do so .
behind the house at the rue fossette there was a garden . large , considering that it lay in the heart of a city . and to my recollection at this day it seems [male] . but time , like distance , lends to certain scenes an influence so softening . and where all is stone around , blank wall and hot pavement , how precious seems one shrub .
but these four latter kinds of nayikas do not differ much from the first four kinds of them . as there is no separate object in resorting to them , therefore vatsyayana is of opinion that there are only four kinds of nayikas . i.e. , the maid , the twice married woman . the public woman , and the woman resorted to for a special purpose . and , lastly , the wife of a relation , of a friend .
in december they definitely made up their minds to give up the shoe business . take their few hundred dollar from the bank , and , the coming summer . open a tea room in an old farm house on the cliffs at [organization] , cape cod . out of saving money for the tea room , that winter . the applebys had as much fun as they had ever found in spending .
it seemed as if her gaze stabbed through [female] 's eyes to the very centre of her brain . [female] tried to bear it , and shrunk and withered . she would have fallen upon the floor at her feet a helpless . sobbing heap , but the white hand would not let her go , find your courage . if you have lost it -- and speak plain words , ', [female] commanded .
he knew his lesson and his golden text and his catechism question perfectly . had he not studied them -- perforce -- in mrs. [male] 's kitchen . all last sunday afternoon ? davy , therefore , should have been in a placid frame of mind . as a matter of fact , despite text and catechism . he was inwardly as a ravening wolf .
it was an ancient electric , one of the early types . and painted gray , the sight of her sitting there , slenderly erect . and of her face , where beauty and dignity combined . melting to a dreamy recollected smile , filled him with a sudden great pride of her . as they kissed coolly and he stepped into the electric , he felt a quick fear lest he had lost the requisite charm to measure up to her .
three weeks rolled over , -- an interval not without its share of interest for the inhabitants of the little village of leenane . since on one morning mr. [male] had made his appearance on his way to clifden . and after an absence of two days returned to the castle . the subject for popular discussion and surmise had not yet declined . when a boat was seen to leave glencore , heavily laden with trunks and travelling gear .
as we circled upon the broad platform i saw sab than rushing up the steps to aid his father . but , as he raised his hand to strike , dejah thoris sprang before him and then my sword found the spot that made sab than jeddak of zodanga . as his father rolled dead upon the floor the new jeddak tore himself free from dejah thoris grasp , and again we faced each other , he was soon joined by a quartet of officers . and , with my back against a golden throne , i fought once again for dejah thoris .
the melbourne trading had not of late done much credit to this gentleman 's commercial genius . he had put his trust in firms that had crumbled to pieces before the bills drawn upon them came due . involving his [male] in considerable losses , [male] was rich enough to stand these losses , however . and he reconciled himself to them as best he might . taking care to send his australian partner imperative instructions for a more prudent system of trading in the future .
the abundance was prodigal ; the judgment , cultivation , high perception of truth . rarity and beauty , seemed almost faultless , gems of pictures . treasures of sculpture , bronze , [location] . carvings , glass , coins , curiosities which it would have taken a life time properly to learn . here i saw for the first time a private library on a large scale .
letty became aware that [female] did not recognize her at first , and the hope sprung up in her heart that he might not see [male] at all . but she could not utter a word , and stood returning [female] 's gaze like one fascinated with terror . presently her heart began again to bear witness in violent piston strokes . `` is it really you , my child ? '' said [female] , in an uncertain voice -- for , if it was indeed she .
i say this in no spirit of boasting , sheer necessity has driven me to the pass . that to secure myself from utter desolation i must recognize all the value that i truly possess . therefore , through the , terrible experience of suffering let there come upon me the joy of deliverance . deliverance from self distrust , i have come to distinguish what is really in me from what i foolishly imagined to be there . the profit and loss account has been settled .
i remember that you said that you would be home at this time . and therefore i write to you about the borough , things are changed since you went away . and , i fear , not changed for your advantage , we understand that mr. [male] will apply for the [male] hundreds at the end of march . and that the election will take place in april . no candidate will appear as favoured from hence , we used to run a favourite .
and , making a desperate effort to restrain his tears , he rushed rather than went out of the room . i lifted the curtain of my window . and saw him get into the cabriolet which awaited him at the door . but scarcely was he seated before he burst into tears and hid his face in his pocket handkerchief . a good while elapsed before i heard anything more of armand .
`` go , sir , '' said the queen , with her most bewitching smile . `` go and return at midnight , '' and [male] retired , but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper . [male] was not less exact to his appointment and at half past nine o'clock he entered the ante room . he found the cardinal dressed as an officer , and he looked very well in that costume . which , as we have already said , he wore elegantly ; only he was very pale and trembled slightly .
the desires , however , of those people do not go beyond money . but of that their covetousness is insatiable , and on this occasion it was carried to such a pitch that they would have taken even the clothes we wore as captives if they had been worth anything to them . it was the advice of some of them to throw [male] all into the sea wrapped up in a sail . for their purpose was to trade at some of the ports of [male] . giving themselves out as bretons , and if they brought [male] alive they would be punished as soon as the robbery was discovered .
miss [female] left the room . waited till the first heat of her indignation had passed away -- decided on reflection that mr. [male] should see his niece in the interests of common humanity before he closed his doors on her as a stranger . and thereupon , without a word of previous warning . took lady [female] with her to his room . the servant was posted at the door to prevent their entrance .
gentleman , women will love her that she is a woman more worth than any man . men , that she is the rarest of all women , [male] . had our prince , -- jewel of children . seen this hour , he had pair would well with this lord . there was not full a month between their births , florizel . by his command have i here touch would sicilia .
mattresses and bedding were laid on these planks and the sleepers lay . their faces hardly two feet from the ceiling , esther slept with the baby . a little boy of five ; the two big boys slept at the other end of the room by the front door . the eldest was about fifteen , but he was only half witted ; and he helped in the housework . and could turn down the beds and see quicker than any one if the occupant had stolen sheet or blanket .
she recalled his words , his looks . how few and meager they had been for her hungry heart ! a vision -- a transcendently seductive vision of a mexican girl arose before her . she writhed with a jealous pang , she wondered when he would come back . he had not said he would come back , she had been with him .
[female] might have hers when she had taken up a certain quantity . [female] when she had gathered twice as many , and [female] was to clear away the rest . wonderful to state , the girls did their part . but [male] was in such a fury that he flew upon the table . scattered the bread and milk about the floor .
and [female] made an inclination of the head to his officers . who knew him well enough to attach a certain value to the condescension . the officers looked at each other as if to read each other 's opinions in their eyes . with the intention of evidently acting , should they agree , according to the desire of [male] . and already the latter saw with joy that the result of their consent would be sending a bark to [male] and [male] .
possibly it was a feeling of disquiet under silent observation which caused tollman . after luncheon , to turn his guest over to his wife for entertainment . and haymond acquiesced with enthusiasm to conscience 's suggestion that they go for a sail to the greater bay . to conscience this was all retrieving from monotony a little scrap of the life for which she had so eagerly yearned . the life of progress , stimulus and breadth .
i sat still , i was not happy , and yet i could not feel all the unhappiness which i considered appropriate to the circumstances . my companion took up a `` kölnische zeitung , '' and glanced over the advertisements , while i looked a little stealthily at him . and for the first time took in more exactly what he was like , and grew more puzzled with him each moment . as he leaned upon the table , one slight .
our party had halted at the entrance to the building . and at a sign from the leader i had been lowered to the ground . again locking his arm in mine , we had proceeded into the audience chamber . there were few formalities observed in approaching the martian chieftain , my captor merely strode up to the rostrum . the others making way for him as he advanced .
for , when they had walked on with her to the little house in the clean village by the paper mill . where [female] had a lodging with an elderly couple employed in the establishment . and when mrs [female] and [female] had been up to see her room and had come down . the mill [organization] , this called [female] away for the time . and left the secretary and [female] standing rather awkwardly in the small street .
`` come on , '' cried a voice which was not the voice of a man . but of which no one would ever have said : `` it is a woman 's voice . '' the thenardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the window . and it was she who had just given vent to this roar . she had thrown off her shawl , but retained her bonnet .
bathsheba was momentarily relieved of that wayward heaviness of the past twenty-four hours which had quenched the vitality of youth in her without substituting the philosophy of maturer years . and she resolved to go out and walk a little way , so when breakfast was over . she put on her bonnet . and took a direction towards the church , it was nine o'clock . and the men having returned to work again from their first meal , she was not likely to meet many of them in the road .
hearing a footstep below , he rose and went to the top of the stairs . at the bottom of the flight he saw a woman standing . and on her turning up her face recognized the pale , dark eyed izz huett . this was a girl whose secret he had guessed . but who had not yet guessed his ; an honest girl who loved him -- one who would have made as good .
a score or so of houses , heavily framed with oak . stood scattered in a long green valley ascending from the river , at the foot . the road crossed a bridge , and mounting on the other side . disappeared into the fringes of the forest on its way to the moat house . and further forth to holywood abbey , half-way up the village .
the live long morning , mrs. [male] . busy writing upstairs in the cottage , could see him out of the window . she had a very long sight , and these elms were grouped on a rise of the ground . his indolence was plainly exposed to her criticism on a gentle green slope . mrs. [female] wondered at it .
he sighed , and stretched out his hand for a copy of one of the english illustrated papers . it had a fresher interest to him because the next number of it that he would see would be in the city in which it was printed . the paper in his hands was thejames budget . and it contained much fashionable intelligence concerning the preparations for a royal wedding which was soon to take place between members of two of the reigning families of [location] . there was on one page a half tone reproduction of a photograph .
but the ocean is a treacherous element , and the fair weather which had so long characterized their voyage . was to be varied now by fierce and angry gales , it was the season of the year when they might expect this . and the captain had kept a sharp lookout , it was the middle of a fine afternoon that there was observed a singular phenomenon in the wind which appeared to come from half a dozen points at the same moment . the ship of course lost her steerage way . and the sea began most singularly to get up from all points in heavy cross waves .
he understood the sex and knew what pleased them . and with the subtle art of a courtier he breathed into their ears a flattery too delicate to be resented . beside such an expert [male] , floundering in his first real love affair . felt but a blunderer , perhaps mr. [male] realized this and rather enjoyed the amateur 's chagrin . however that may have been , he certainly let no opportunity slip for the display of his proficiency .
ruminating on this strange chance and strange glimpse , he turned into the court yard . as he looked , by mere habit , towards the feebly lighted windows of his mother 's room . his eyes encountered the figure he had just lost . standing against the iron railings of the little waste enclosure looking up at those windows and laughing to himself . some of the many vagrant cats who were always prowling about there by night , and who had taken fright at him .
god , whatever they may have been , were personified in the man he beheld . he was dressed in [male] , like [male] . his hair and beard grew in wild disorder . and from under shaggy eyebrows there burned a pair of deep set eyes of the color of blue steel . he was a man to inspire awe .
now , however , her face was thin , white and haggard . for such a life as she had lived had never conduced to the beauty and health of any one . her eyes , sunken in their sockets , and swollen with recent weeping . looked frightfully large and wild , and to complete the metamorphosis , her beautiful , glossy hair was now cut short on her neck . and pushed far back from a brow , across which lay more than one premature wrinkle .
`` what are you staring at ? '' he shouted to the cook . who in her red skirt , with sleeves rolled up , swinging her bare elbows . had stepped to the corner to listen to what was being said , `` what marvels ! '' she exclaimed , but hearing her master 's voice she turned back . pulling down her tucked up skirt , once more something whistled , but this time quite close .
she had no doubt of what mr. [male] was often thinking about . his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression . and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening . a reasonable visit paid , mr. [male] began to move. -- he must be going . he had business at the crown about his hay .
after some days of inquiry and research . [male] became convinced that the case of the father of the marshalsea was indeed a hopeless one . and sorrowfully resigned the idea of helping him to freedom again , he had no hopeful inquiry to make at present . concerning little [male] either ; but he argued with himself that it might . for anything he knew -- it might be serviceable to the poor child .
he knew that tree well ; it was the boundary mark of his youth . the sign , to him , of the time when some of his earliest . strongest feelings had left him , he felt sure they would never return . and yet , at this moment , there was a stirring of affection at the remembrance of that [male] donnithorne whom he had believed in before he had come up to this beech eight months ago . it was affection for the dead : that [male] existed no longer .
the venders of cider and beer are rolling their barrels among the groups . some busy passers-by come and go , the merchants converse and call to each other from the thresholds of their shops . the festival , the ambassadors , coppenole , the pope of the fools . are in all mouths ; they vie with each other , each trying to criticise it best and laugh the most . and , meanwhile , four mounted sergeants , who have just posted themselves at the four sides of the pillory .
[male] suddenly cast aside his chibouque , drew the lasso from his pocket . threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold . and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock . then the animal fell over on the pole , which snapped , and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way . gladly availing himself of this opportunity , the coachman leaped from his box .
[female] had been most eager , most anxious , most conciliatory as a messenger ; but no good had come of these messages . and trevelyan had gone forth to tell all his trouble to his family lawyer . old mr. [male] had been his father 's ancient and esteemed friend . and he could tell things to mr. [male] which he could not bring himself to tell to any other living man . and he could generally condescend to accept mr. [male] 's advice .
it was indeed [female] bracy -- bloody with spurring , fiery red with speed . his armour bore all the marks of the late obstinate fray . being broken , defaced , and stained with blood in many places , and covered with clay and dust from the crest to the spur . undoing his helmet , he placed it on the table .
she was eager to follow up the advantage she had gained the day before in establishing terms of friendship with ranald . for her heart went out to the boy , in whose deep , passionate nature she saw vast possibilities for good or ill. on her return from her daily visit to macdonald dubh . she took the camp road . and had the good fortune to find ranald alone , `` rigging up '' his kettles preparatory to the boiling . but she had no time for kettles today .
i was only partially successful , as a sharp pain in my left shoulder attested . but in the sweep of my glance as i sought to again locate my adversary . a sight met my astonished gaze which paid me well for the wound the temporary blindness had caused me . there , upon dejah thoris chariot stood three figures . for the purpose evidently of witnessing the encounter above the heads of the intervening tharks .
the answer [male] would have given did not come ; that his heart was hurt became evident in his eye . darkened , and saddened , and pained , he turned a little aside , but was patient . i knew where there were plenty of shawls near at hand . i ran and fetched one , `` she shall wear this , if i have strength to make her , '' said i , folding it well round her muslin dress .
the body of [female] waldeck was interred in the convent where he expired . in which his brothers , having assumed the habit of the order . lived and died in the performance of acts of charity and devotion . his lands , to which no one asserted any claim . lay waste until they were reassumed by the emperor as a lapsed fief .
he did not understand who she was , as he caught the simple . straight , unabashed look , which showed that his being there was of no concern to the beautiful countenance . and called up no flush of surprise to the pale ivory of the complexion . he had heard that mr. [female] had a daughter . but he had imagined that she was a little girl .
those who loved her waited anxiously for the disillusion which must come in spite of all their cherishing . for till now rose had been so busy with her studies , travels , and home duties that she knew very little of the triumphs . trials , and temptations of fashionable life . birth and fortune placed her where she could not well escape some of them . and [female] , knowing that experience is the best teacher .
and , reader , do you think i feared him in his blind ferocity ? if you do , you little know me . a soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon i should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock . and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath it . but not yet , i would not accost him yet , he descended the one step .
there was a fire in the grate , as there had been night and day for fifteen years . there was a kettle on the hob , as there had been night and day for fifteen years . there was a little mound of damped ashes on the top of the fire . and another little mound swept together under the grate , as there had been night and day for fifteen years . there was a smell of [female] dye in the airless room .
he showed his writings to sir [male] and the queen . and both were sorrowful in that no word of reconciliation was said , on the day appointed . as the king sat in hall at carlisle . surrounded by his knights and their ladies , with sir gawaine standing on the high seat beside him . there came the beat of many hoofs , and into the town rode sir [female] with the queen .
it would never do , he feared , for his mother to live in the same house with him when he was married . and yet how hard she would think it if he asked her to leave him ! yes , there was a great deal of pain to be gone through with his mother . but it was a case in which he must make her feel that his will was strong . it would be better for her in the end , for himself .
but , soon after , this young man , hitherto indifferent as a creole to every thing that was passing in the world . begged of me to teach him to read and write , in order that he might correspond with [location] . he afterwards wished to obtain a knowledge of geography . that he might form some idea of the country where she would disembark . and of history , that he might know something of the manners of the society in which she would be placed .
between him andpierre rose swiftly what he had seen last night . carmin fanchet in all the lure of her disheveled beauty . crushed close in the arms of the man whose wife only a moment before had pressed her lips close to his . and as the eyes of the two met , there came over him a desire to tell the other what had happened . that he might see him writhe with the sting of the two edged thing with which he was playing .
she opened her mouth to answer him . he flung himself on his knees to receive with adoration the word . possibly a tender one , which was on the point of issuing from her lips . she said to him , `` you are an assassin ! '' the priest clasped her in his arms with fury .
or `` yours with deadly enmity , '' or `` yours with respect , '' or `` yours with most profound indifference , '' exactly in accordance with the state of his father 's mind . if he had only known what was that state , he was afraid of going beyond his father in any offer of reconciliation . and was firmly fixed in his resolution that he would never be either repentant or submissive in regard to the past . if his father had wishes for the future .
then he went up to tintagel and as he went the people he had freed waved green boughs . and rich cloths were hung at the windows , but when tristan reached the castle with joy . songs and joy bells sounding about him . he drooped in the arms of king mark . for the blood ran from his wounds .
ay -- in the matter of the killing of master [male] last christmas . seeing that the justices would not move of theirselves , some folk ha petitioned the lieutenant of cornwall to command them to grant a warrant for sir [male] 's arrest on a charge o ', murder . but the justices ha refused to be driven by his lordship . answering that they hold their office direct from the queen and that in such a matter they are answerable to none but her [female] .
but today , if the scene had never presented itself more alluringly . in that moist spring bloom between showers . when the horse chestnuts dome themselves in unreal green against a [location] sky . and the very dust of the pavement seems the fragrance of lilac made visible . today for the first time the sense of a personal stake in it all .
a tender and pleasing melancholy diffused itself over her mind . and as she mused , she heard the dashing of distant oars . presently she perceived upon the light surface of the sea a small boat . the sound of the oars ceased , and a solemn strain of harmony ( such as fancy wafts from the abodes of the blessed ) . stole upon the silence of night .
the clock struck four , [male] fidgeted about , yawned privately ; counted the knots in the table , yawned publicly . counted the flies on the ceiling , yawned horribly ; went into the kitchen and scullery . and so thoroughly studied the principle upon which the pump was constructed that he could have delivered a lecture on the subject . stepping back to fancy , and finding still that she had not done , he went into her garden and looked at her cabbages and potatoes . and reminded himself that they seemed to him to wear a decidedly feminine aspect .
the husband rose , took the lamp , and went to the door . which he opened , he was a man of lofty stature . half peasant , half artisan , he wore a huge leather apron . which reached to his left shoulder , and which a hammer , a red handkerchief . a powder horn , and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle .
the way to become rich is to make money , my dear edna . not to save it , he said , he regretted that she did not feel inclined to go with him and select new fixtures . he kissed her good by . and told her she was not looking well and must take care of herself . she was unusually pale and very quiet , she stood on the front veranda as he quitted the house .
as long as he was in the city , [male] kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself . but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark , he drew softly nearer . so that when they entered the bois [male] boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master . in fact , we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneasiness . [male] could not help perceiving that something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and said .
on getting back to the rectory , i questioned zillah . nugent , in my absence , had run up into the sitting room . had waited there a few minutes alone , on the chance of my return . had got tired of waiting , and had gone away again , i inquired about lucilla next . a few minutes after nugent had gone , she had left her room .
`` we noticed among those present the charming and popular mrs. `` billie '' [female] . '' a consuming desire came over him to talk about the girl to someone . obviously indicated as the party of the second part was [female] hignett . if [male] was still capable of speech -- and after all the boat was hardly rolling at all . he would enjoy a further chat about his ruined life .
a marriage in the house proved to be exciting but extremely disorganizing , everything seemed designed to unhinge the mind and make the cat wretched . all the furniture was moved , all the meals were disarranged , and everybody . [female] included , appeared in new , bright costumes , she had to wear cream and a brown sash and a short frock and her hair down . and [female] cream and a brown sash and a long skirt and her hair up . and her mother , looking unusually alert and hectic , wore cream and brown also .
she took the now soundly sleeping child from the doctor 's arms and laid him on the bed in the canvas room . the day had been warm , and the fire was out in the great fireplace . the evening wind , light and cool , laden with sweet odors . swept through the cabin , so the doctor and his diminutive namesake drove contentedly away next morning in the great covered wagon . and cassandra , standing by her mother 's door .
at the right beat of the music he looked sideways at his partner with a [male] and triumphant air . suddenly stamped with one foot , bounded from the floor like a ball . and flew round the room taking his partner with him . he glided silently on one foot half across the room . and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them , when suddenly .
athos waited with a kind of impatient joy for the reply about to be made to this embarrassing question by [male] . the intractable enemy of the king , his rival . the father hoped that the obstacle would overcome the desire . he was thankful to [male] beaufort . whose lightness or generous reflection had thrown an impediment in the way of the departure of a son .
he had dismissed his cab on alighting in coleman street . believing that his journey was ended ; but the walk to cavendish square was a short one . and he set out at a rapid pace , the check that had befallen him was a severe one . it seemed a deathblow to all hope . a dreary realization of that vague dread which had pursued him from the first .
he questioned himself ; he sought to divine who could have been that soul in torment which had not been willing to quit this world without leaving this stigma of crime or unhappiness upon the brow of the ancient church . afterwards , the wall was whitewashed or scraped down , i know not which . and the inscription disappeared , for it is thus that people have been in the habit of proceeding with the marvellous churches of the middle ages for the last two hundred years . mutilations come to them from every quarter . from within as well as from without , the priest whitewashes them , the archdeacon scrapes them down .
`` there 's no reason why you should , '' said dalrymple . `` i can do the second figure in my own room . '' then there was a bargain made that [female] should not be a portrait . `` it would never do , '' said mrs. [female] . shaking her head very gravely , though there was really very little done to the picture on that day .
that sound did not awaken her ; and now again he wished to leave her in this senseless state . that not remembering what had passed , she might escape the punishment , but at this instant . giffard , with another servant , passed by the foot of the stairs . on which , lord elmwood called to them . and into giffard 's hands delivered his apparently dead child .
when the table was set -- such as it was -- brogard surveyed it with evident satisfaction . he then dusted one of the chairs with the corner of his blouse . gave a stir to the stock pot , threw a fresh bundle of faggots on to the fire . and slouched out of the room , marguerite was left alone with her reflections . she had spread her travelling cloak over the straw .
the last inconvenience would soon have become intolerable , had i not found means to open and prop up the skylight . thus admitting some freshness , underneath this aperture i pushed a large empty chest . and having mounted upon it a smaller box , and wiped from both the dust . i gathered my dress ( my best , the reader must remember . and therefore a legitimate object of care ) fastidiously around me .
it was lylda , she had laid aside her court robe and stood now in her glistening silver tunic . her hair was uncoiled , and fell in dark masses over her white shoulders . blowing out behind her in the wind , the crowd hesitated at the sight of her . and quieted a little , she stood rigid as a statue for a moment . holding her arms outstretched , then , dropping them with a gesture of appeal she began to speak .
when a woman or young girl is taken in the act . `` flagrante delicto , '' she conceives a deadly hatred to the witness . the author , or the object of her fault . and so the true , the single minded , the untamed and untamable [female] conceived within her soul an unquenchable desire to get the better of that righteous spirit . to drive him into some fatal inconsistency , and so return him blow for blow .
then , one by one , these sights fitted themselves into one another and made sense . he remembered that he was in derby gaol . not in his own cell ; that the lean face was of a man called topcliffe . that a physician was there as well as the others ; that they had been questioning him on various points . and that some of these points he had answered , while others he had not .
and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method . [male] fixed upon a certain [male] , a favorite of the cardinal 's . [male] had [male] , and [male] found himself opposed to two adversaries . as to [male] , he sprang toward [male] himself . the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his side .
he attempted to apologise for the miserableness of the surroundings in which he received them . saying that her [male] his hostess could not be everywhere at once ; and that her guests must do the best that they could . and all this was mixed with sudden wails from his wife , sudden graspings of his hands by hers . it all seemed to the quiet girl , who sat ill at ease on the little three-legged stool . that this was not the way to meet adversity , then she drove down her criticism .
he flattered himself that [male] saw no signs of his weakening . he did not know that [female] put more and more effort into her paddle . until her arms and body ached , because she saw the truth . the churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed . five portages were made between sunrise and eleven o'clock .
the day after the ceremony [female] vavasor and [female] vavasor started for matching priory . all this was very terrible to [female] , who had not much feminine taste for finery . of the dress she had heard , -- of the dress which was waiting at matching to be made up after her arrival . though as yet she knew nothing of the trinkets . there are many girls who could submit themselves at a moment to the kindness of such a woman as lady [female] .
it was useless to endeavor to understand adrian 's enigmatical moods . but that sentence puzzled allard for many hours , whenever it recurred to him . the walk to the garage was accomplished as often before , several times they passed men whom allard recognized as belonging to the secret service . and doubtless passed many more whom he did not know , all letting the emperor 's favorite go by . unquestioned , with his companion , but he sighed with relief when they finally reached the garage and he stepped into the low .
they lingered side by side . surveying their domain , there was not space in it . at this hour , for the shadow of the elm tree in the angle of the hedge . it crossed the lawn , cut the flower border in two . and ran up the side of the house to the nursery window .
the creaking lock gates opened slowly , and the light boat passed in as soon as there was room enough . and the creaking lock gates closed upon it , and it floated low down in the dock between the two sets of gates . until the water should rise and the second gates should open and let it out . when [male] had run to his second windlass and turned it . and while he leaned against the lever of that gate to help it to swing open presently .
doctor , this is serious , and demands close observation . the will , you see , is the mainspring of the mind . and if it is affected the whole mind goes to pieces , [male] . god knows how i have taught myself to humor his wishes through all these long years of trial . oh , if you knew what a life i have endured with him .
we have just attempted to restore , for the reader 's benefit . that admirable church of notre dame [male] [location] . we have briefly pointed out the greater part of the beauties which it possessed in the fifteenth century . and which it lacks today ; but we have omitted the principal thing . the view of [location] which was then to be obtained from the summits of its towers .
`` but i had not finished , '' wailed mr. [male] . clutching at wally , he was feeling profoundly aggrieved , if it is bad to be all dressed up and no place to go . it is almost worse to be full of talk and to have no one to talk it to . otis [male] had at least another twenty minutes of speech inside him on the topic of [male] . and wally was the nearest human being with a pair of ears , wally was in no mood to play the part of confidant .
plants and trees sprang out of the sand . and such flowers as there were -- roses , and pomegranate blossoms . hibiscus , and passion flowers . climbed , and rambled , and pushed , and hung in heavy drapery , as best they could without attention or guidance . but one of the principal paths led to a kind of arbour .
if this tale should ever be read by any lady who , in the course of her career . has entered a house under circumstances similar to those which had brought [female] to [female] rectory . she will understand how anxious must have been that young lady when she encountered the whole [female] family in the hall . she had been blown about by the wind , and her cloaks and shawls were heavy on her . and her hat was a little out of shape -- from some fault on the part of [female] .
the letter , whence sprang all this felicity . was short , containing little more than this assurance of success ; and every particular was deferred till [male] could write again . but for particulars [male] could well afford to wait , the needful was comprised in mr. [male] 's promise . his honour was pledged to make everything easy ; and by what means their income was to be formed . whether landed property were to be resigned , or funded money made over , was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern .
and i would have you remember also that the work of a member of parliament can seldom be of that brilliant nature which is of itself charming . and that the young member should think of such brilliancy as being possible to him only at a distance . it should be your first care to sit and listen so that the forms and methods of the house may as it were soak into you gradually . and then you must bear in mind that speaking in the house is but a very small part of a member 's work . perhaps that part which he may lay aside altogether with the least strain on his conscience .
all of april and part of may they spent at sea . without any great danger or mishap they came to port at southampton . one day , between three o'clock and vespers . they cast anchor and went ashore , the young men . who had never been accustomed to endure discomfort or pain , had suffered so long from their life at sea that they had all lost their colour .
she had been found as the sun went down through a low sea fog . casting crimson along a broad sea path into a little cave on the shore . where a bathing maiden saw her lying . one evening in early summer , i stood with a group of men and women on a steep rock that overhung the sea . they were all questioning me about my world and the ways thereof .
they had been driving through the lane with the towering hedge on one side and the open meadow on the other . the horses had somewhat quickened their lazy pace , as they turned into the avenue leading to the house . a whole choir of feathered songsters fluted a sudden torrent of melodious greeting from their leafy hiding places . octavie felt as if she had passed into a stage of existence which was like a dream . more poignant and real than life , there was the old gray house with its sloping eaves .
minnie having departed in clean cap and smart shawl . we , too , set out , leaving the house solitary and silent -- silent , at least . but for the ticking of the clock , we were soon clear of [location] . the fields received us , and then the lanes . remote from carriage resounding chaussees , ere long we came upon a nook .
but the relation , the one the ten minutes had so beautifully created . was there to take straight up : and this not , on his own part . from mere professional heartiness , mere bedside manner . which she would have disliked -- much rather from a quiet , [male] air in him of having positively asked about her . asked here and there and found out , of course he could not in the least have asked .
`` you gettum pine ? good , '' replied [female] in the same tone . that was all ; for strong men never talk freely of what is in their hearts . there is no need ; they understand , two months passed away . winter set in , the camp was built and inhabited , routine had established itself . and all was going well , the first move of the [male] and d. company had been one of conciliation .
his indifference was to them far more galling than contempt . he seemed sublimely unconscious of the fact that he was not popular with the police officials . a circumstance that merely added to the dislike with which he was regarded . there was much to be said for [organization] , which was called upon to carry out instructions from `` a pack of blinking amachoors , '' as one of sage 's most pronounced antagonists had phrased it .
`` his father lives near el aghouat , '' victoria reminded her sister , and maïeddine had used this fact as one excuse . when he admitted that they might have taken a shorter road . but in her heart the girl had guessed why the longest way had been chosen . she did not wish to hide from saidee things which concerned herself .
it dealt with fine aspects of mr. [male] 's feelings . and as [female] mind was still largely engaged with fundamentals and found no pleasure in metrical forms . she had not as yet cut its pages , so that as she saw him she remarked to herself very faintly but definitely . `` oh , golly , '' and set up a campaign of avoidance that mr. [female] at last broke down by coming directly at her as she talked with the vicar 's aunt about some of the details of the alleged smell of the new church lamps . he did not so much cut into this conversation as loom over it .
before the noon mass was over , we were at the well again . for there was a deal to do yet , and i was determined to spring the miracle before midnight . for business reasons : for whereas a miracle worked for the church on a week day is worth a good deal . it is worth six times as much if you get it in on a sunday . in nine hours the water had risen to its customary level .
the stairs were narrow ; the dining room was dark , and possessed none of those appearances of plenteous hospitality which a dining room should have . but all this would have been as nothing if the drawing room had been pretty as it is the bounden duty of all drawing rooms to be . but [female] vavasor 's drawing room was not pretty . her father had had the care of furnishing the house . and he had intrusted the duty to a tradesman who had chosen green paper .
and as he said these words , yellow bird sat with bowed head and closed eyes . with the soft tress of nada 's hair in her hands . it was the physical union between them . and all that day , and the night that followed , yellow bird held it in her hand or against her breast as she struggled to send out the soul that was in her on its mission to oo mee the pigeon . in darkness she buried the food that was left her .
[female] -- she tried to say ; but no sound came . or if it did the crackling of the fire covered it up . she must go nearer , she began to creep towards him . softly , softly , she stole nearer and nearer . and the fire crackled and he heard nothing .
we must try to track em , since we can not hear em , said jan , fumbling in his pockets , he struck a light . and held the match to the ground , the rain had been heavier here . and all foot and horse tracks made previous to the storm had been abraded and blurred by the drops . and they were now so many little scoops of water .
as soon as the effort ceased , his trust dropped down dead and powerless . and all sorts of wild fancies chased each other like dreams through his mind . here was a little piece of miserable , gnawing confirmation , `` she bore up better than likely '' under this grief , she had then some hope to look to . so bright that even in her affectionate nature it could come in to lighten the dark hours of a daughter newly made motherless , yes !
the sails were taken down , of course , on the return to liverpool . and the progress they made , rowing and tacking , was very slow , the men talked together . disputing about the pilots at first , and then about matters of local importance . in which [female] would have taken no interest at any time . and she gradually became drowsy ; irrepressibly so , indeed , for in spite of her jerking efforts to keep awake .
now , [male] was a man with faults . he was somewhat sly , and , perhaps within certain lines , at times capable of giving the word honesty a liberal interpretation . but amongst many others he had one conspicuous virtue . he loved the old squire as a highlandman loves his chief . and would almost , if not quite , have died to serve him , his billet was no easy one .
along each of the two longer sides of the interior , were ranged three ranks of men . in white robes , standing silent and solemn . each with a sword by his side , although the rest of his costume and bearing was more priestly than soldierly . for some distance inwards , the space between these opposite rows was filled with a company of men and women and children . in holiday attire , the looks of all were directed inwards .
a few days before that fixed on for the marriage , an accident happened to [male] . he crushed the thumb of his right hand . this was not a serious matter ; and he had not allowed any one to trouble himself about it . nor to dress it , nor even to see his hurt , not even cosette . nevertheless , this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage .
torarin had said these words in a low voice . without thinking whether the dog was listening or not , but scarcely were the words uttered when the dog stood up on the load and raised a terrible howl . the horse made a bound to one side . and [organization] himself was startled and looked about him to see whether wolves were in pursuit . but when he found it was grim who was howling , he tried to calm him .
saying which she seized , and , through the casement standing wide for heat . flung them , and down they flashed , and smote the stream . then from the smitten surface flashed , as it were , diamonds to meet them . and they past away , then while sir [male] leant . in half disdain at love .
in his own estimation he was perfectly irresistible , and imagined he had only to say the word and all the girls in the country would eagerly accept the offer of being [male] of his fancy colored horse and person . for [male] he had conceived a violent passion and wondered much that she should repel all his serious advances . at last he wrote her a letter saying that on a certain afternoon he would visit her and make a formal offer of his hand . he bade her weigh the matter seriously . so that she would have no one to blame but herself .
lastly they hung my shield around my neck . and i was all complete and ready to up anchor and get to sea , everybody was as good to me as they could be . and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup cup her own self . there was nothing more to do now , but for that damsel to get up behind me on a pillion . which she did , and put an arm or so around me to hold on .
phineas finn heard it all , and was disgusted to find that his enemy thus became the hero of the hour . it was , indeed , the opinion generally of the liberal party that mr. [male] had not said much to flatter his new chancellor of the exchequer . in praise of plantagenet [male] he had been very loud . and he had no doubt said that which implied the capability of mr. [male] . who , as it happened , was sitting next to him at the time .
no one called him [male] . and he only knew the gossip also available to the evening papers and the frequenters of clubs . but he was , however , good at inventing ; and as soon as he had come to an end of first hand knowledge . in order to answer her inquires and keep her there to himself he proceeded to invent . it was quite easy to fasten some of the entertaining things he was constantly thinking on to other people and pretend they were theirs .
my dear [male] , -- i hope you will forgive me . but i am tired of this mess , i was never cut out for the woods . and so i am going to dismiss myself , leaving all best wishes behind for you . go in and fight , you are a devil for fighting . and will surely win , i will only be in the way , so i am going back with the ship .
there had been some talk of an autumnal session , but mr. [male] 's decision had at last been against it . who can not understand that such would be the decision of any minister to whom was left the slightest fraction of free will in the matter ? why should any minister court the danger of unnecessary attack . submit himself to unnecessary work . and incur the odium of summoning all his friends from their rest ?
it was with a miserable heart that an hour or two later he came down to supper . his father was already at table , sitting grimly in his place . he made no sign of welcome or recognition as his son came in . during the meal itself this was of no great consequence . as silence was the custom ; but the boy 's heart sank yet further as .
he had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours . he was worn out by the jolts of the cart . but he was not conscious of it , it seemed to him that he felt nothing . he approached a [male] frame which was suspended on the wall . and which contained , under glass , an ancient autograph letter of [male] .
`` nay , '' said [male] , `` it can not be done . '' for [male] , now grown an old man in his dotage . had fallen under the spell of a damsel of the court named nimue . with her he soon departed from the king , and evermore went with her wheresoever she went . ofttimes he wished to break away from her , but he was so held that he could not be out of her presence .
the king knelt down and kissed the pallid face of sir gawaine . and for very sorrow he felt that the heart in his breast was nigh to bursting . so in a little while , with the beat of the surf and the cry of the seagulls upon his ears . the light of the sun in his eyes . and the free air of heaven all about him .
the period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of borodino to the expulsion of the french proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest . it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors . nor even in armies and battles , but in something else . the french historians , describing the condition of the french army before it left [location] . affirm that all was in order in the grand army .
if what ? if any one out of a hundred different visions , all equally childish and impossible . could have been realized , if she had been an earl 's daughter . like lady gwendoline , if she had been a great actress . and [female] lansdell had seen her and fallen in love with her from a stage box ! if he had met her in the walworth road two or three years ago .
[male] cleared the flight of richly carpeted stairs in three bounds and burst frantically into the little drawing room . the black gowned figure in the arm chair , drawn up to the fire . rose at his entrance and stood facing him inquiringly ; one arm resting on the chair back . with the other she pressed a lace handkerchief to her lips . the room was lighted by a single cluster of electric bulbs only .
[male] felt three cheers rise within him as she stepped down . but it being sunday he did not utter them . in dress , miss [female] passed his expectations . a green and white gown , with long , tight sleeves , a green silk handkerchief round her neck and crossed in front . a green parasol , and green gloves , it was strange enough to see this verdant caterpillar turn out of a road waggon .
he found , however , a confidential young man who was able to tell him that the hospital need not increase the number of its wards on this occasion . he had dropped down to dean 's yard to see a clerical friend . but the house was shut up and he could not even get an answer . he sauntered into the abbey , and found them mending the organ . he got into a cab and was driven hither and thither because all the streets were pulled up .
' i suppose you would have had him cast a glance into the squire 's pew , said i , laughing at the vehemence of her hostility , nota bene.—mr . hatfield never spoke to me , neither did sir hugh or lady meltham . nor mr. [male] or [male] , nor mr. [male] or his sisters . nor any other lady or gentleman who frequented that church .
but [male] seized the moment at which , in this movement . the sword of [male] deviated from the line . he freed his weapon , made a lunge . and touched his adversary on the shoulder , [male] immediately made a step backward and raised his sword . but [male] cried out that it was nothing .
events succeed each other sometimes with the rapidity of hailstones . their effect is overpowering ; they deaden the senses . falling upon existences habitually calm , they render incidents rapidly unintelligible even to those whom they chiefly concern . we become scarcely conscious of our own adventures ; we are overwhelmed without guessing the cause . or crowned with happiness without comprehending it , for some hours deruchette had been subjected to every kind of emotion .
she was there ; yes , she was there , she was alone . in a pew near the pulpit , on her knees . with her hands clasped and her eyes looking upwards . the high old-fashioned pew shut her in from the congregation about her . but mr. [male] could look down upon her from his post of observation in the gallery .
she woke up , as it was natural , much refreshed in body . but with a consciousness of some great impending calamity , she sat up in bed to recollect . and when she did remember , she sank down again with all the helplessness of despair . but it was only the weakness of an instant . for were not the very minutes precious , for deliberation if not for action ?
the loose sleeve of her dressing gown had fallen back , and he could see that her arm was round and white . and very fair , was she conversant with such tricks as these ? his mother had called her clever and cunning as a serpent . was it so ? had his mother seen with eyes clearer than his own . and was he now being surrounded by the meshes of a false woman 's web ? he moved away from her quickly , and stood upon the hearth rug with his back to the empty fire grate .
this good old seaman had gathered from his voyages many wonderful stories . he had seen at madagascar birds feathers , three of which sufficed to make a roof of a house . he had seen in [location] , field sorrel . the stalks of which were nine inches high , in new [male] he had seen troops of turkeys and geese led about and guarded by a bird .
the church of the house , constructed in such a manner as to separate the great convent from the boarding school like a veritable intrenchment . was , of course , common to the boarding school , the great convent . and the little convent , the public was even admitted by a sort of lazaretto entrance on the street . but all was so arranged , that none of the inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world . suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand .
it was a still day of frost . the sky was arched above him , across the high hills . like that terrible crystal which is the vault above which sits god . hard blue from horizon to horizon . the fringe of feathery birches stood like filigree work above him on his left .
four at a time , and five at the bottom ? stale ! down the banisters ? but in which fashion ? on his face , feet foremost , very stale . on his stomach , sideways ? paltry ! on his back . with his arms stretched down on both sides ? forbidden , or on his face . head foremost , in a manner unknown as yet to any but himself ?
la rochelle , which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other calvinist cities . was , then , the focus of dissensions and ambition . moreover , its port was the last in the kingdom of france open to the english . and by closing it against england , our eternal enemy . the cardinal completed the work of joan of arc and the duc [female] guise .
`` why , you do know something about it after all ! '' cried [female] , startled into a sort of friendliness in spite of herself . and at the words and the sight of her quick smile [female] 's professional composure reeled on its foundations . he had half risen . with the purpose of springing up and babbling of the passion that consumed him .
when margarita saw ramona shoved into her room by the pale and trembling [female] . saw the key turned , taken out , and dropped into the [female] 's pocket . she threw her apron over her head . and ran into the back porch , almost a remorse seized her . she remembered in a flash how often ramona had helped her in times gone by .
when the old lady had found out everything crooked [female] could tell her . she went into the house and sat down by the window of her little sitting room to think it all over . she was tingling from head to foot with excitement . [female] 's daughter , this old lady had had her romance once . long ago -- forty years ago -- she had been engaged to [female] gray .
this , indeed , i did with less disturbance than i had done formerly . for these things i did not steal , but they were stolen to my hand . i got safe to my lodgings with this cargo . which was a piece of fine [male] lustring silk . and a piece of velvet ; the latter was but part of a piece of about eleven yards .
but , sir , i will deliver his challenge by word of mouth . set upon aguecheek a notable report of valour ; and drive the gentleman . as i know his youth will aptly receive it . into a most hideous opinion of his rage , skill , fury , and impetuosity . this will so fright them both , that they will kill one another by the look , like cockatrices .
suddenly she was roused , she knew not how or by what , she was conscious that all was real . that hundreds were looking at her , that true sounding words were being extracted from her . that that figure , so bowed down , with the face concealed with both hands . was really [female] , her face flushed scarlet . and then , paler than before , but in dread of herself .
imagine , on mr. [male] 's part . that this was one for [male] and at least ten for kid twist . nosey murphy , and bert rhine , i will not be so absurd as to say that the mate is afraid of those gangsters . i doubt if he has ever experienced fear . it is not in him , on the other hand .
dining at the cottage , the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again . it must be so , she was perfectly convinced of it . it would be an excellent match , for he was rich . and she was handsome , mrs. [male] had been anxious to see colonel brandon well married . ever since her connection with sir [male] brought him to her knowledge .
not having received any orders from you , and having promised mrs. [female] that i would leave this house on monday . i go with [female] to my aunt , mrs. outhouse , tomorrow . on the sunday evening the four ladies drank tea together . and they all made an effort to be civil , and even affectionate , to each other . mrs. [female] had at last allowed priscilla to explain how it had come to pass that she had told her brother that it would be better both for her mother and for herself that the existing arrangements should be brought to an end .
a torrent poured from the mourning sky , and there was a wild sound of marching water . which victoria could hear , under the haoulis which sheltered her . no water came through them , for the arching form of the bassour was like the roof of a tent . and the rain poured down on either side , she peeped out . enjoying her own comfort , while pitying maïeddine and the negroes .
with [male] and his team it was all hard work . his horses were willing and quick enough , but they were ill trained and needed constant tugging at the lines . in vain [male] shouted and cracked his whip . hurrying his team to his pile and back again ; the horses only grew more and more awkward . while they foamed and fretted and tired themselves out , behind came ranald .
then across my vision came a picture most terrifying to me . it was as if my mother in law and i were spectators of a series of motion picture films . toward the table , where dicky stood surrounded by his friends . there sauntered the mysterious stranger , who had attracted my mother in law 's attention by his scrutiny of me . but he was no stranger to the men surrounding dicky .
the rectory stands about half a mile beyond the village , it is a large house . and has been growing steadily for some centuries round the great kitchen , with its narrow red tiles . as the rector would point out to his guests on the first night of their arrival . taking his brass candlestick , and bidding them mind the steps up and the steps down . and notice the immense thickness of the walls , the old beams across the ceiling .
lady [female] said as she passed on from the door to her own room . and in about five minutes she was back with her [female] . would you mind going into my room -- it 's just there . and sitting with [female] for a minute ? this lady [female] said in the sweetest possible tone to the girl who was waiting on [female] . and then , when they were alone together , she got into a little chair by the fireside and prepared herself for conversation .
you could not throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king . of course , i could not get these people to leave off their armor . they would not do that when they bathed , they consented to differentiate the armor so that a body could tell one team from the other . but that was the most they would do , so , one of the teams wore chain mail ulsters . and the other wore plate armor made of my new bessemer steel .
from foot to head , in short , from furthest south to extremest north . [male] was perfect , he was an ornament to his surroundings . the metropolis looked better for him , one seems to picture [location] as a mother with a horde of untidy children . children with made-up ties , children with wrinkled coats and [female] . sighing to herself as she beheld them , then cheering up and murmuring with a touch of restored complacency .
formerly , after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few phrases . marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with congratulations and happy faces . announcing the trophies taken , the corps of prisoners . bundles of enemy eagles and standards . cannon and stores , and [organization] had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather in the baggage wagons .
she went up to her husband , hat in hand . and looking round to see that she was not watched , put the hat on his head . and then lifted him as it were from his chair . he did not refuse to be led , and allowed her to throw round his shoulders the old cloak which was hanging in the passage . and then he passed out , and was the first to seat himself in the [male] fly .
i think he trusted a little also to the energy which is begotten by circumstances . some feeling rushing warmly and making resolve easy , while debate in cool blood had only made it more difficult . however it was , he did not distinctly say to himself on which side he would vote . and all the while he was inwardly resenting the subjection which had been forced upon him . it would have seemed beforehand like a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he .
overflowing pitcher plants grew in irregular beds . on slender stems , lifting high their flat buds . but scattered in groups here and there , sometimes with massed similar colours , sometimes in clumps and variegated patches . stood the rare , early fringed orchis , some almost white , others pale lavender and again the deeper colour of the moccasins . while everywhere on stems , some a foot high , nodded the exquisite lavender and white showy orchis .
there was a soft yet cool wind from the south , bringing the fragrance of creosote blossoms . and it seemed to the girl that never had she seen such white floods of moonlight . not even that night a year ago at [organization] . even the sky was milk white , there were no [female] shadows anywhere , only dove gray ones . except under the veranda roof , her hammock was screened from the light by one dark shadow .
the ropes and chains which remained unsevered prevented its entirely breaking up , and the qualities which [male] had given it as a means of defence made it . in the end , a more effective weapon of destruction . instead of a buckler , it had become a battering ram , besides this , it was now full of irregularities from breaking . ends of timbers projected from all parts . and it was , as it were , covered with teeth and spikes .
he felt rather sheepish , coming out of his room in his mask and domino . but the corridors of the hotel were empty , and for the most part dark . there was no one up but the porter , who wished him a [male] time in as matter of fact fashion as if he were going out to an evening party in his dress coat . his spirits mounted in the atmosphere of adventure which the ladies diffused about them in the carriage . effie [male] laughed aloud when he entered , in childish gaiety of heart .
i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil . at the house of the count of monte cristo , replied madame [male] villefort . turning away with marked coldness of manner , this answer . and especially the tone in which it was uttered , chilled the heart of poor [male] .
but , for all that , he obtained a command upon his mind . and built himself up in patience to await the issue . in [organization] church the prayers were kept up all night without cessation . now with the singing of psalms , now with a note or two upon the bell . rutter , the spy , was nobly waked , there he lay .
i glanced at them and skimmed smoothly on , till i came to the outside circle where there was a skater all alone . his hands thrust deep into his great coat pockets , the collar of the same turned high about his ears . and the inevitable little gray cloth studentenhut crowning the luxuriance of waving dark hair . he was gliding round in complicated figures and circles . doing the outside edge for his own solitary gratification , so far as i could see .
the ignorant and the credulous , however , are not satisfied , in the first place . the house was not built at the period of the wars of the revolution . it bears the date `` 1780 , '' which was anterior to the revolution . in the next place it was not built for an observatory . it bears the letters `` elm pbilg , '' which are the double monogram of two families .
during all this time [female] , had fallen into a profound reverie . for the first time he found himself face to face with monk . with the man he had so much desired to see ; and , with that peculiar glance which god has given to eagles and kings . he had fathomed the abyss of his heart . he beheld monk , then , resolved positively to die rather than speak , which was not to be wondered at in so considerable a man .
but still the castlemorris interest would go a long way , it might be possible to stand against it . but it would be much more desirable that the candidate should have it at his back . [male] was fully alive to this as he sat opposite to the old lord . saying now a word about the old lord 's gout in his legs and arms . and then about the gout in the stomach , which had carried away to another world the lamented late member for the borough .
mr. [male] gave up his intention of sending a letter to meet [male] . since it would not now hasten his return : the news of his grandfather 's death would bring him as soon as he could possibly come . he could go to bed now and get some needful rest , before the time came for the morning 's heavy duty of carrying his sickening news to [organization] and to [male] 's home . `` it 's no use , sir , '' he said to the rector , it 's no use for me to go back .
this story of farms thrown up and money not forthcoming pointed its own moral . and a sad one it was , even [male] 's almost childish excitement about the legend of the buried treasure showed him how present to her mind must be the necessity of money . and he fell to thinking how [male] it would be to be able to play the part of the fairy prince and step in with untold wealth between her and the ruin which threatened her family . how well that grand looking open-minded squire would become a great station , fitted as he was by nature . descent , and tradition , to play the solid part of an english country gentleman of the good old fashioned kind .
[male] rose , and took stock of all his quaint treasures on the mantelpiece . especially her mind was held and fascinated by a stout little bear in brass . sitting solidly yet jauntily on its haunches , its front paws clasping a brazen pole . its head turned sideways ; its small , beady , eyes , looking straight before it . the chain , from its neck to the pole denoted captivity and possible fierceness .
all these circumstances which i had so often witnessed came back to my memory , and i regretted her death as one might regret the destruction of a beautiful work of art . it was impossible to see more charm in beauty than in that of marguerite . excessively tall and thin , she had in the fullest degree the art of repairing this oversight of nature by the mere arrangement of the things she wore . her cashmere reached to the ground , and showed on each side the large flounces of a silk dress . and the heavy muff which she held pressed against her bosom was surrounded by such cunningly arranged folds that the eye .
a pin occasionally dropped with the wax , and the embers heated it red as it lay . but secretly [female] had a more pleasing hope , [female] might possibly decline to use her pen . it was rather her way to work silently -- and surprise him by appearing at his door . how fully her mind was made up to do otherwise he did not know , to [male] 's regret it began to rain and blow hard as the evening advanced . the wind rasped and scraped at the corners of the house .
detailed descriptions then follow of the chitrini or art woman . the shankhini or conch woman . and the hastini or elephant woman , their days of enjoyment . their various seats of passion , the manner in which they should be manipulated and treated in sexual intercourse . along with the characteristics of the men and women of the various countries in hindostan .
[male] alone had gone on with his work as if nothing had happened . but observing the cessation of the tools , he looked up . and said , in a tone of indignation , look there , now ! i can not abide to see men throw away their tools i that way , the minute the clock begins to strike .
the book saith that the lady that was besieged had word of her sister 's coming and a knight with her . and how he had passed all the perilous passages , had won all the four brethren . and had slain the [male] knight , and how he overthrew sir [male] . and did great battle with sir [male] , and was made knight by him . she was glad of these tidings .
nothing that was not defined , regularly disposed , linked , precise , circumscribed , exact , limited . closed , fully provided for ; authority was a plane surface . there was no fall in it , no dizziness in its presence . javert had never beheld the unknown except from below , the irregular , the unforeseen . the disordered opening of chaos , the possible slip over a precipice .
but although at this time the members of the two families ceased to seek after each other 's society . nothing was said , the thread of friendship might be joined afresh at any time . only just now it was broken ; and [male] was glad of it . before going to haytersbank he sought each time for some little present with which to make his coming welcome . and now he wished even more than ever that [female] had cared for learning .
on the sunday when he and his bride first appeared in the meeting house [female] went up the aisle behind her father in an array of flowered brocade . stiff with threads of silver , so wonderful that people all turned their heads to stare at her . she wore also a new bonnet of rose colored satin . and her curls were caught back a little , and her face showed as clear and beautiful as an angel 's . the young bridegroom glanced at her once across the meeting house , then he looked at his bride in her gay wedding finery with a faithful look .
[male] here was button holed by [male] , who said something to him as to the approaching division . they were standing in front of the door of the house . almost in the middle of the lobby , with a crowd of members around them . on a spot which , as frequenters know , is hallowed ground . and must not be trodden by strangers , he was in the act of answering erle .
but while he was questioning him they heard a loud outcry at the gate of the inn . the cause of which was that two of the guests who had passed the night there . seeing everybody busy about finding out what it was the four men wanted . had conceived the idea of going off without paying what they owed ; but the landlord . who minded his own affairs more than other people 's , caught them going out of the gate and demanded his reckoning .
one day i met him on the footpath over the talfourd hill . he told me that `` women were funny . '' i had heard already of domestic differences , people were saying that [male] foster was beginning to find out what sort of man she had married . he looked upon the sea with indifferent , unseeing eyes . his wife had snatched the child out of his arms one day as he sat on the doorstep crooning to it a song such as the mothers sing to babies in his mountains .
grace thereupon declared that she would not argue with an old friend she valued so highly as she valued him . saying the words with the easy elusiveness that will be polite at all costs . it might possibly be true , she added , that she was getting on in girlhood when that event took place . but if it were so , then she was virtually no less than an old woman now . so far did the time seem removed from her present , do you ever look at things philosophically instead of personally ? ', she asked .
they came quite close to me , rubbing their muzzles against my body and nosing for the bits of food it was always my practice to reward them with . opening the gates i ordered the two great beasts to pass out , and then slipping quietly after them i closed the portals behind me . i did not saddle or mount the animals there , but instead walked quietly in the shadows of the buildings toward an unfrequented avenue which led toward the point i had arranged to meet dejah thoris and sola . with the noiselessness of disembodied spirits we moved stealthily along the deserted streets . but not until we were within sight of the plain beyond the city did i commence to breathe freely .
`` why is that gendarme there ? '' asked [male] of himself . then , all at once , he replied , with that logic which the reader has . doubtless , remarked in him , there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn . instead of being astonished , let me dress myself , and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet [male] chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in [location] . now then , said [male] , while dressing himself , i will wait till he leaves .
mrs. [female] turned the difficult problem over in her mind and . having no previous experiences whereby to measure it , telephoned for old [female] . who came out from the factory and sat through the discussion with a solemn countenance . so [female] was living openly with a woman of whom they had never heard . he would probably be as defiant and indifferent as his nature was strong , the standpoint of parental authority was impossible .
georgie was filled with enormous despair till they two met again . they foregathered in the middle of an endless . hot tropic night , and crept into a huge house that stood . he knew , somewhere north of the railway station where the people ate among the roses . it was surrounded with gardens , all moist and dripping .
his cigar had gone out again , and he threw it into the fire and vaguely meditated getting up to find another . but the mere act of leaving his chair seemed to call for a greater exertion of the will than he was capable of . and he leaned his head back with closed eyes and listened to the drumming of the rain . a different noise aroused him , it was the opening and closing of the door leading from the corridor into the adjoining room . he sat motionless , without opening his eyes .
what precise line of conduct it was generally anticipated that this gold digging and silver mining young person would adopt . it would be difficult to say : it is sufficient that the general sentiments regarding her were of a distrustful . if not timorous , nature , to miss [female] , who felt all this in the very air she breathed . the girl 's innocence of the condition of affairs was even a little touching . with all her splendor , she was not at all hard to please , and had quite awakened to an interest in the impending social event .
the shock changed his mood , gloom still obsessed him . but blended now with remorse , he began to look at the matter from claire 's viewpoint . and his pity switched from himself to her , in the first place . the poor girl had rather a rotten time , could she be blamed for wanting him to make money , no . yet whenever she made suggestions as to how the thing was to be done .
but levin did not shoot himself , and did not hang himself . he went on living , when he went back to the country at the beginning of june . he went back also to his usual pursuits , the management of the estate . his relations with the peasants and the neighbors . the care of his household , the management of his sister 's and brother 's property .
this was not as sir mordred desired ; for he did not doubt that if sir [male] came he would have little trouble to persuade the king that he was innocent . when the messenger was gone , therefore , sir mordred sent a servant after him . who slew him in a wood and hid his body under a bush . meanwhile , sir mordred counselled sir mador to repeat his demand that the king should cause the queen to be led to the stake . since no knight had come forward and offered to fight for her , for a time the king put him off .
then the shots were repeated without regularity , but always aimed with the same accuracy . nevertheless , as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends . the rochellais continued to advance in quick time , with every three shots at least two men fell . but the march of those who remained was not slackened , arrived at the foot of the bastion . there were still more than a dozen of the enemy , a last discharge welcomed them .
it was difficult to say whether he was more absurd than cruel or more cruel than absurd . mrs. [female] , with the fine ear of a woman . seemed to detect a jeering intention in his meanly unctuous tone . something more vile than mere cruelty , she glanced quickly over her shoulder and saw the girl raise her two hands to her head . then let them fall again on her lap , [female] in front of the fire was like the victim of an unholy spell .
[male] had put the breakfast things on the tray ready for setting . the bread was cut , the coffee portioned into the jug . the fire burned bright , and the kettle sang . [male] took the cloth from the drawer in the oak dresser . and went to the parlour to lay the table , mr. [male] was at the end of the garden .
her eyes were quite dry ; the instinct of life seemed to have left her . they spoke some little while longer , until it was time for visitors to leave the hospital . it was not until she got into the fulham road that tears began to run down her cheeks . they poured faster and faster , like rain after long dry weather . the whole world disappeared in a mist of tears .
he had been too sudden with his proposal for a transfer . and the punishment for such ill judgment must be that success would now be impossible to him . and yet how could he have waited , feeling that miss effingham , if she were at all like other girls whom he had known . might have promised herself to some other lover before she would return within his reach in the succeeding spring ? but she was not like some other girls , ah ; .
`` not too many of you , '' was his final adjuration , as , giving me a look . he slipped out into the hall , i followed him immediately . he had gained the moon lighted corridor near his own door . where he stood awaiting me with something in his hand . as i approached , he drew me to the window and showed me what it was .
he knew that he wandered a good bit . but he could not help it , and it was probably his salvation . in those tortured badlands , riven by ages of frost and flood . one might follow a man on a straight track between two points . but to find a single rider lost in that wilderness was a matter of sheer luck .
the dissipations of the reign of [male] xv. . the orgies of that fatal and egotistic period , have produced an effete generation . in which manners alone survive the nobler vanished qualities . forms , which are the sole heritage our nobles have preserved . the abandonment in which [male] , was allowed to perish may thus be explained , with some slight reservations .
but things could never be again as they had been before , if she meant to starve her tiger . steel bars must be between them for evermore . none of those sentimental suggestions of attempts to be a sort of unsatisfactory cross between sister and friend would do for the man whose head she had unconsciously held against her breast . [male] knew this , he had kept himself magnificently in hand after she put him from her . but she knew he was only giving her breathing space .
of our crew is brunette , aft , with the exception of wada and the steward . who are our servants , we are all blonds . what led me to this discovery was woodruff 's effects of tropical light on white men . which i am just reading , [male] woodruff 's thesis is that the white skinned . blue eyed aryan , born to government and command .
when [female] could attend again she found the men were discussing the ethics of the depreciation of house property through the increasing tumult of traffic in the west end . and agreeing with each other to a devastating extent , it came into her head with real emotional force that this must be some particularly fantastic sort of dream . it seemed to her that her father was in some inexplicable way meaner looking than she had supposed . and yet also , as unaccountably , appealing , his tie had demanded a struggle . he ought to have taken a clean one after his first failure , why was she noting things like this ?
suddenly that quietness was broken , the sound of music . the peculiar blatant noise of trumpets smote the air . it came nearer , and with it the measured tramp of feet . i rose and went to look out , a hussar regiment was passing ; before them was borne a soldier 's coffin . they carried a comrade to his grave .
other folk , however , yet more learned , declared it to be an ancient british dwelling . and pointed triumphantly to a hollow at the top , wherein the ancient britishers were supposed to have moved . lived , and had their being -- which must , urged the opposing party , have been a very damp one . thereon the late mrs. [female] , who was a british dwellingite . proceeded to show with much triumph /how/ they had lived in the hole by building a huge mushroom shaped roof over it .
but at the most exciting stage of the argument , for no reason that katharine could see . all chairs were pushed back , and one after another the [female] family got up and went out of the door . as if a bell had summoned them , she was not used to the clockwork regulations of a large family . she hesitated in what she was saying , and rose , mrs. [female] and joan had drawn together and stood by the fireplace . slightly raising their skirts above their ankles , and discussing something which had an air of being very serious and very private .
loder methodically mixed his own drink and lifted the glass . oh , to the career of [male] chilcote ! ', he answered . for an instant the other hesitated , there was something prophetic in the sound of the toast . but he shook the feeling off and held up his glass . `` to the career of [male] chilcote ! ''
i see her every hour , she follows me wherever i go , ', he said . suddenly she was aware that the dead girl had taken her place on the bench beside sir [male] and was whispering in his ear . but still sir [female] knew nothing of her being so close to him or of her whispering in his ear . he was only aware of her presence in the mortal dread that came over him . elsalill saw that when the dead girl had sat for a few moments whispering to sir [male] .
tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in it . your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places on finding that they are respected . any violence to them or to their property is promptly punished . his majesty the emperor and king protects them . and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey his orders .
i notice here what a dreadfully difficult thing it is to get back . in such a case as mine -- to the exercise of one 's sight . we have a cat and a dog in the house . would it be credited , if i was telling it to the world instead of telling it to my journal . that i actually mistook one for the other today ? -- after seeing so well .
prince [male] began to reply and to state his own plan . which might have been as good as weyrother 's , but for the disadvantage that weyrother 's had already been approved . as soon as prince [male] began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan . prince dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent mindedly not at the map . but at prince [male] 's face .
fanny learnt from her all the particulars which had yet transpired , her aunt was no very methodical narrator . but with the help of some letters to and from sir [male] . and what she already knew herself , and could reasonably combine , she was soon able to understand quite as much as she wished of the circumstances attending the story . mrs. [female] had gone , for the easter holidays . to [female] , with a family whom she had just grown intimate with .
i must now further explain my purposes , -- and i must beg you to remember that i am driven to do so by your direct disobedience to my expressed wishes . should there be any further communication between you and colonel osborne . not only will i take your child away from you , but i will also limit the allowance to be made to you to a bare sustenance . in such case , i shall put the matter into the hands of a lawyer . and shall probably feel myself driven to take steps towards freeing myself from a connection which will be disgraceful to my name .
but it had become essential to do something ; the young people were engaged to each other . and a manner of life must be suggested , discussed , and as far as possible arranged . lady [female] was useful at such work , having a practical turn of mind . and understanding well the condition of life for which it was necessary that her friend should prepare herself . the lover was not vicious , he neither drank nor gambled , nor ran himself hopelessly in debt .
it was a warm , dark , autumn night , it had been raining for four days . having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half over a sticky . muddy road , bolkhovitinov reached litashevka after one o'clock at night . dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a signboard . general staff , and throwing down his reins , he entered a dark passage .
and as soon as she had got rid of [female] she went and shut herself up in her room . at first she felt stunned ; she saw the trees . the paths , the ditches , rodolphe , and she again felt the pressure of his arm . while the leaves rustled and the reeds whistled , then she recalled the heroines of the books that she had read . and the lyric legion of these adulterous women began to sing in her memory with the voice of sisters that charmed her .
[male] had been at the three jolly bargemen , smoking his pipe . from a quarter after eight o'clock to a quarter before ten . while he was there , my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door . and had exchanged good night with a farm laborer going home . the man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her ( he got into dense confusion when he tried to be ) .
furnished with such additional evidence as these documents afforded , i considered myself to be sufficiently prepared for a consultation with mr. [male] . and [male] wrote [male] to mention my name to him . and to specify the day and hour at which i requested to see him on private business . there was time enough in the morning for me to take [female] out for her walk as usual . and to see her quietly settled at her drawing afterwards , she looked up at me with a new anxiety in her face as i rose to leave the room .
oak sat down meditating for nearly an hour , during this time two [male] spiders . of the kind common in thatched houses , promenaded the ceiling . ultimately dropping to the floor , this reminded him that if there was one class of manifestation on this matter that he thoroughly understood . it was the instincts of sheep . he left the room , ran across two or three fields towards the flock .
as we have said , there was but little sea , the slight agitation of the water was due almost entirely to its confinement among the rocks . every passage , small or large , is subject to this chopping movement , the inside of a channel is always more or less white with foam . [male] did not approach the douvres without caution . accustomed to long absences , he had at home a number of necessaries always ready . he had brought a sack of biscuit .
thus , mr [male] : taking from the hands of his daughter . with special ill will , a lent cap , and grumbling as he pulls it down over his ears . then , getting on his unsteady legs , leaning heavily upon her , and growling . `` hold still , can not you ? what , you must be a staggering next , must you ? '' he takes his departure out of the ring in which he has had that little turn-up with death .
day by day , the singular attraction grew between them . she loved [female] , but she took him unreservedly into her heart . [female] observed , idly , that she never called him `` mr . [male] . '' at first she spoke of him as `` your friend '' and afterward , when he had asked her to , she yielded , with an adorable shyness .
monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other . when another door opened , and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person . he was a man of forty to forty five years . but he seemed at least fifty , and his [male] mustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair . which was cut short , in the military fashion , he was dressed in plain clothes .
going straight on , he began to follow the long ridge of rocks which connected the bû [male] rue with the great natural obelisk of granite rising erect from the sea . which was known as the beast 's horn , this was the place of the gild holm 'ur seat . he strode on from block to block like a giant among mountains . to make long strides upon a row of breakers is like walking upon the ridge of a roof . a fisherwoman with dredge nets , who had been walking naked footed among the pools of sea water at some distance .
it was a satisfaction to walk into the keeper 's house . even as a stranger , on a fine spring morning like the present . a curl of wood smoke came from the chimney , and drooped over the roof like a blue feather in a lady 's hat . and the sun shone obliquely upon the patch of grass in front . which reflected its brightness through the open doorway and up the staircase opposite .
the great strength she had used in the old days to conquer and subdue . to win her will and to defend her way , seemed now a power but to protect the suffering and uphold the weak . and this she did , not alone in hovels but in the brilliant court and world of fashion . for there she found suffering and weakness also , all the more bitter and sorrowful since it dared not cry aloud . the grandeur of her beauty , the elevation of her rank .
pickering , yes : that 's the formula , `` you do not think , sir . '' that 's the end of every conversation about eliza , [female] . as if i ever stop thinking about the girl and her confounded vowels and consonants . i am worn out , thinking about her , and watching her lips and her teeth and her tongue . not to mention her soul , which is the quaintest of the lot , mrs. [female] .
you know the spot , where three [female] trees . lift up their branches fell , and moaning , ceaseless as the seas . still seem , in every passing breeze , the deed of blood to tell . they named him mad . and laid his bones where holier ashes lie ; yet doubt not that his spirit groans in hell 's eternity .
fleur suffered relief and a sense of insult . clearly he meant to convey that he was breaking with her mother . how dared he have anything to break , and yet how dared he break it ? her dreams that night were endless and uneasy ; she rose heavy and unrested . and went at once to the study of whitaker 's almanac .
the unknown saluted the soldier in a lofty fashion , and ascended the staircase . whilst a cry , `` lieutenant , a visit ! '' transmitted from sentinel to sentinel , preceded the unknown , and [male] the slumbers of the officer . dragging on his boot , rubbing his eyes , and hooking his cloak . the lieutenant made three steps towards the stranger .
the match dropped from his fingers , and , as darkness fell again . it hid the soldier in the strong arms of the fugitive . not a soldier bold , but a gasping . blushing , unresisting coward , the lithe form quivered and then became motionless in the fierce , straining embrace . the head dropped upon his shoulder , his hot lips caressing the burning face and pouring wild .
in the meantime , and for the few weeks in which he did not call . liddy lived in an agony of suspense , she knew what was going on . for it was current gossip in school . and there was something in his face that seemed to her ominous , in school she tried hard to act unconcerned . even when , as often was the case , other girls whose young and loving hearts were sore .
oh , i would give my heart to death , to keep my honour fair . yet , i will not give my inward faith my honour 's name to spare ! not even to keep your priceless love , dare i . beloved , deceive ; this treason should the future prove . then , only then , believe , i know the path i ought to go i follow fearlessly .
upon hearing this assurance , mrs. [female] of course promised [female] that she would trust her and expected in return to be told everything then . at the moment , but she perceived that her daughter did not mean to tell her anything further at that time . [female] , when she had received her mother 's promise . embraced her warmly , caressing her and petting her as was her custom , and then after a while she resumed her work . mrs. [female] was delighted to have the evil thing over , but she could not but feel that the conversation had not terminated as it should have done .
for one second [male] was dazed , the next , he knew what it must mean . these people were the kind whom god had made so big and generous they divided home and summer with tenement children from the big city thirty miles away . some boy was coming for a week , maybe , into what exactly filled [male] 's idea of heaven . but he was not the boy , [female] followed a footpath white with pear petals around the big house and standing beside a pump waited while the woman stepped to the back porch for a cup . he took it , drinking slowly , `` thank you ma'am , ''
pierre looked round , [male] , brushing his knees with his hand ( he had probably soiled them when he . too , had knelt before the icon ) , came up to him smiling , [male] was elegantly dressed . with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign . he wore a long coat and like kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder . meanwhile kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in the shade of the nearest house .
captain [female] opened for her a gate into another field . when they got through he kept walking abreast . elbow to elbow almost , his voice growled pleasantly in her very ear , staying in this dull place was enough to give anyone the blues . his sister scribbled all day , it was positively unkind . he alluded to his nieces as rude .
for several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room . mingled with broken words of comfort , tender assurances of help . and hopeful whispers that died away in tears , poor [female] was the first to recover . and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example . for with her , work was panacea for most afflictions .
david rode directly to his log stable . put up his horse , then unslung his box and walked with it toward his cabin . suddenly he stopped , from the thick shrubbery where he stood he could see in at the large window where his microscope was placed quite through his cabin into the light . white canvas room beyond , before the fireplace . clearly relieved against the whiteness of the farther room .
on the next day lord and lady [male] went back to [male] hall . when the end of august comes , a master of hounds . who is really a master , -- is wanted at home , nothing short of an embassy on behalf of the great coverts of his country would have kept this master away at present . and now , his diplomacy having succeeded , he hurried back to make the most of its results . lady [female] , before she went , made a little speech to [female] finn .
that very night she began an appealing letter to clare . concealing from him her hardships , and assuring him of her undying affection . any one who had been in a position to read between the lines would have seen that at the back of her great love was some monstrous fear . almost a desperation -- as to some secret contingencies which were not disclosed , but again she did not finish her effusion . he had asked izz to go with him .
it is something which we do not even believe . there was too much ignorance in [male] , even after his misfortune . to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there , at times he did not rightly know himself what he felt . [male] was in the shadows ; he suffered in the shadows . he hated in the shadows ; one might have said that he hated in advance of himself .
but as she turned up her face to make her final plea . he smothered the words with his own lips upon hers . for years she had dwelt for him on the most remote borderland of unattainable dreams . now her heart was throbbing against his own and he knew exultantly that whatever her mind might say in protest . her heart was at home there , in his brain pealed a crescendo of passion that drowned out whispers of remonstrance as pounding surf drowns the cry of a gull .
the breeze was from the west : it came over the hills . sweet with scents of heath and rush . the sky was of stainless blue ; the stream descending the ravine . swelled with past spring rains , poured along plentiful and clear , catching golden gleams from the sun . and sapphire tints from the firmament .
for years after [male] remembered the impression produced in him by this involuntary appeal . this cry from soul to soul , without other consciousness than their moving with kindred natures in the same embroiled medium . the same troublous fitfully illuminated life , but what could he say now except that he should see mr. [male] again tomorrow ? when he was gone , [female] 's tears gushed forth . and relieved her stifling oppression , then she dried her eyes .
`` oh , thank you , '' said i , again , hastening to make myself ready . and parenthetically hoping , as i ran upstairs , that [female] 's eyes might not start quite out of her head with pride at the honor conferred upon her house and visitors . very soon i was seated beside the [male] in the dark green [male] . with the grand coachman and the lady 's own jäger beside him . and we were driving along a white road with a wild kind of country spreading round .
the year was not completed when thenardier said : a fine favor she is doing us , in sooth ! what does she expect [female] to do with her seven francs ? and he wrote to demand twelve francs , the mother . whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy . `` and was coming on well , '' submitted , and forwarded the twelve francs .
above , on the stair landing , a deep toned clock began to strike midnight and every one cried [female] christmas ! and `` olivia 's won , '' and there was more hand clapping , in which i joined with good will . some one behind me was explaining what had just occurred , olivia , the youngest daughter of the house . had been denied a glimpse of the ball ; miss [organization] had made a wager with her host that olivia would appear before midnight . and olivia had defeated the plot against her , and gained the main hall at the stroke of christmas .
he had really a movement of anger against her at that moment . and it impelled him to go away without pause . it was all one flash to [male] . his last words -- his distant bow to her as he reached the door . the sense that he was no longer there , she sank into the chair .
she put her head on my shoulder as a homesick child might have done . and i felt her draw two or three long , shuddering breaths , the dry sobs which take the place of tears in the rare moments when lillian underwood gives way to emotion . i stroked her hair with tender . pitiful fingers , noticing as i did so what ravages her foolish treatment of her hair had made in tresses that must once have been beautiful . originally of the blonde tint she had tried to preserve .
george thanked him for his cordial invitation . but he rode away from the house rather depressed in spirit , notwithstanding . how stupid he had been during that brief walk on mr. [male] 's lawn . how little he had said to [female] , or she to him ! how dismally the conversation had died away into silence every now and then , only to be revived by some lame question .
[female] emptied and rinsed the tub at the drain . then started again on her face and ears , which he washed thoroughly . he pinned a sheet around her neck . then she divested herself of the rags . [female] lifted her into the tub .
mr [male] muttered , as if he deemed that unnecessary . but , turning to mr [female] , said , mrs [female] . she will do as she likes , i will show you the way . he then preceded mr [male] up the blackened staircase . that gentleman , not unnaturally looking behind him on the road .
for the moment i was a little startled , i left the window . and made the best excuse that i could to the girl . as soon as it was possible to dismiss her , i sent her away . and bathed my eyes with one of grosse 's lotions . and then tried them again in writing this entry , to my relief .
no doubt it was having a strong effect on him as he walked to [male] . [male] 's light hopeful nature had perhaps never had so much of a bruise as from this suggestion that if he had been out of the way [male] might have made a thoroughly good match . also he was piqued that he had been what he called such a stupid lout as to ask that intervention from mr. [male] . but it was not in a lover 's nature . it was not in [male] 's , that the new anxiety raised about [male] 's feeling should not surmount every other .
it was a large room for so small a cottage . and comfortably furnished , with a floor of red tile , and with a grate at one end well raised up from the hearth . upon the hob a kettle sang murmurously . and on a trivet stood a plate whereon rose a tower of toasted muffins . a round table occupied the middle of the floor and was spread with a snowy cloth whereon cups and saucers were arranged .
the mrs. [female] who was so far from being admirable in the eyes of these distant connections . had happened to say this very morning ( not at all with a defiant air . but in a low , muffled , neutral tone , as of a voice heard through cotton wool ) . that she did not wish `` to enjoy their good opinion , '' she was seated . as she observed , on her own brother 's hearth .
on the threshold she met her husband . evidently he had been out all night on strenuous business . his face was haggard , his eyes bloodshot . while in both hands he gripped a small , square paper wrapped package . they looked at each other a second that seemed long to both , then the woman laughed .
sometimes it was impossible to work at all for hours at a time . but thorpe did not allow a bad morning to spoil a good afternoon , the instant a lull fell on the storm . he was out with his scaling rule . and he expected the men to give him something to scale . he grappled the fierce winter by the throat .
mr. [male] was a bachelor of fifty . to whom lady [male] was endeavoring to make the family agreeable , in the hope he might take hesper off their hands . i need not say he was rich , he was a common man . with good cold manners , which he offered you like a handle . he was selfish , capable of picking up a lady 's handkerchief .
dantes was alone in darkness and in silence . cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead . with the first dawn of day the jailer returned . with orders to leave dantes where he was . he found the prisoner in the same position .
well , i set myself to recovering leo . who , to my infinite relief , i found was not dead , but only fainting . and in the end i succeeded , as i have said . and he sat up ; and then i saw another dreadful thing , when we entered that awful place his curling hair had been of the ruddiest gold . now it was turning grey , and by the time we reached the outer air it was snow white .
`` quite well , i thank you , miss everdene , '' said shepherd oak from the doorpost , if i do not . i will inquire , [female] was rather staggered by the remarkable coolness of her manner . certainly nobody without previous information would have dreamt that oak and the handsome woman before whom he stood had ever been other than strangers . but perhaps her air was the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced her from a cottage to a large house and fields .
he saw a face over him . and he knew now that it was the face of the man he had seen in the firelight . the face of [male] , the free trader . every atom of strength in him rose in a superhuman effort to throw off his assailants . then came the blow , he saw the club over him .
`` then i would better tell donkin as we have no work for him , '' said sylvia , instinctively managing her father by agreeing with him . instead of reasoning with or contradicting him , so [male] took off his coat . and seated himself professional wise on the hastily cleared dresser . so that he might have all the light afforded by the long , low casement window .
thus steadied by a command from the only person in the world who had any shadow of right to control her action . tess grew calmer , the responsibility was shifted . and her heart was lighter than it had been for weeks . the days of declining autumn which followed her assent . beginning with the month of october , formed a season through which she lived in spiritual altitudes more nearly approaching ecstasy than any other period of her life .
there were scientific works , too , among which were represented men such as tyndall . proctor , and [male] , astronomy and physics were represented . and i remarked bulfinch 's age of fable . shaw 's history of english and [male] literature . and [male] 's natural history in two large volumes .
nor did miss gushing altogether fail in her object , when a clergyman 's daily audience consists of but one person . and that person is a young lady , it is hardly possible that he should not become personally intimate with her . hardly possible that he should not be in some measure grateful , miss gushing 's responses came from her with such fervour . and she begged for ghostly advice with such eager longing to have her scruples satisfied . that mr oriel had nothing for it but to give way to a certain amount of civilisation .
it came strongly upon [female] 's mind that her mother ought to have been told . that whatever her faults of discontent and repining might have been . it was an error in her father to have left her to learn his change of opinion . and his approaching change of life , from her better informed child . [female] sat down by her mother , and took her unresisting head on her breast .
she jumped down and snatched the thingummy from his hand . with bent brows and set teeth she wrenched it round . the engine gave a faint protesting mutter . like a dog that has been [male] in its sleep . and was still once more , it was not bream who spoke but a strange voice .
free , and even rude , as he may occasionally be in his manner towards his fat friend . sir [male] is nevertheless afraid , as i can plainly see , of giving any serious offence to the count . i wonder whether i am afraid too ? i certainly never saw a man . in all my experience , whom i should be so sorry to have for an enemy . is this because i like him , or because i am afraid of him , chi sa ?
if we consider a man alone , apart from his relation to everything around him . each action of his seems to [male] free , but if we see his relation to anything around him . if we see his connection with anything whatever . with a man who speaks to him , a book he reads . the work on which he is engaged , even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things about him .
mrs [female] winced a little at the reminder . but only enough to shake her scents and essences anew into the atmosphere of the little carriage . as she settled herself afresh in her own dark corner . mr [male] and mr [male] took a coffee house dinner together in mr [male] 's office . they had newly agreed to set up a joint establishment together , they had taken a bachelor cottage near [location] .
the fisherman threw back his head , and his peal of laughter did what his sternness failed to do . the little fellow wheeled suddenly , and his feet spurned the sand around the bushes for home . the astonished frog dragged bumping after him , `` well ! '' said the fisherman , even the geese in the creek seemed to know that he was a stranger and to distrust him . for they cackled and , spreading their wings , fled cackling up the stream .
they might have smiled could they have read in his imagination the frequent rehearsals of the coming evening . when he and she should each be dressed in their gala attire . to spend a few hours under a bright , festive aspect , among people whose company would oblige them to assume a new demeanour towards each other . not so familiar as their every day manner , but allowing more scope for the expression of rustic gallantry . [male] had so seldom been to anything of the kind .
still on the right side of forty , in appearance he was singularly handsome . tall , dark , upright , with keen eyes , short pointed beard , curling hair and clear cut features . his life had been varied , and there were passages in it which he did not narrate even to his most intimate friends . he was of gentle birth , however , and it was said that he had received a public school and university education in [location] . at any rate he could quote the classics with aptitude on occasion .
he saw it - yes , from the chaise he caught the light . as he turned the corner by the old church . he knew the room from which it shone . he saw the wintry branches of the old trees between the light and him . he knew that one of those trees rustled musically in the summer time at the window of marion 's chamber .
she could not doubt , she dared not indulge a hope . of the paragraph being false , [female] letter . which she had read so often as to make every line her own , was in frightful conformity with it . her eager defence of her brother , her hope of its being hushed up . her evident agitation , were all of a piece with something very bad .
the attitude was to make plain to aunt maud . with the same regularity as her invitations , that they sufficed . thanks awfully -- to themselves , but the ground of it . [female] lived to discern , was that this was only because she did not suffice to them . the little she offered was to be accepted under protest , yet not , really , because it was excessive .
but they all rose simultaneously , which was by itself impressive , and they all exclaimed . and shook hands , and she was introduced to mr. [male] . and the door sprang open , and dinner was announced . and they filed off , [female] offering her his slightly bent [male] arm . as she had secretly hoped he would , in short , had the scene been looked at only through her eyes .
then she told him pretty nearly everything . she said nothing of the money which walter marrable would have inherited had it not been for colonel marrable 's iniquity . but she did tell him that the young people would have no income except the captain 's pay . and poor [female] 's little fifty pounds a year ; and she went on to explain that . as far as she was concerned , and as far as her [female] the clergyman was concerned .
twenty years earlier , when mrs. [female] was miss lina ridgely . she used to be the friend and confidante of the girl who jilted colville . they were then both so young that they could scarcely have been a year out of school before they left home for the year they were spending in [location] . but to the young man 's inexperience they seemed the wisest and maturest of society women . his heart quaked in his breast when he saw them talking and laughing together .
junior dashed for the fence , while [female] lost time in turning to see what that fellow ', might be . so he faced the [male] that had practised on [male] . with lowered head , the [male] sprang at [male] . he flew in air , and it butted space and whirled again . so that before the boy 's breath was fully recovered he lifted once more .
none would have availed had not his eye been in perfect familiarity with its work . and his hand obeyed it as readily as the bolt slips in a well oiled groove . as the thing stood , the lithe agility and unmatched dash of young rupert but just missed being too much for him . he was in deadly peril when the girl [female] ran down to bring him aid . his practised skill was able to maintain his defence , he sought to do no more .
she kept on chattering away there at my bedside , on all manner of things . the maid came and told bimal that her dinner had been served and was getting cold . but she gave no sign of having heard it . `` not had your dinner yet ? what nonsense , it 's fearfully late . '' with this the bara rani took bimal away with her .
the father would have given the son some advice as to the mode in which he should put forward his claim upon violet 's hand . but the son would not wait to hear it , choosing to presume that the conference was over . he went back to the room in which he had kept his dumb bells . and for a minute or two went to work at his favourite exercise , but he soon put the dumb bells down . and began to prepare himself for his work , if this thing was to be done .
as if well pleased with his task , [male] laid himself comfortably on the grass and . leaning his head on his hand , read the lovely story as only one could who entered fully into the spirit of it . rose watched him closely and saw how his face brightened over some quaint fancy . delicate description , or delicious word ; heard how smoothly the melodious measures fell from his lips . and read something more than admiration in his eyes as he looked up now and then to mark if she enjoyed it as much as he .
it was on the old question of whisky . [male] had given orders that no whisky was to be brought aboard . as he intended to tolerate no high sea orgies , soon after leaving dock he saw one of the teamsters drinking from a pint flask . without a word he stepped briskly forward , snatched the bottle from the man 's lips . and threw it overboard , then he turned sharp on his heel and walked away .
the woman opened a low door at the end of this hall . and ushered [female] into a sitting room with three windows looking out upon a dutch bowling green . a quadrangle of smooth turf shut in by tall hedges of holly . the room was empty , and the visitor had ample leisure to examine it while the woman went to seek mrs. [female] . it was a large room with a low ceiling .
then the demigod vanished ; he remained scarcely a man . his head hanging down , his eye dull . his speech slow and painful , [male] would look for hours together at his bottle . his glass , or at [male] , who , accustomed to obey him by signs . read in the faint glance of his master his least desire .
the venom of the unclean animal 's sting had gone so deep into him . that , fond as he was of money . he had told his lawyer that he would not begrudge the expense if he could only punish the man who was hurting him . but the attorney , who understood something of feeling as well as something of money . begged him to be quiet at any rate till the fate of the property should be settled .
an abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from the surrounding wall . at the bottom of this abyss , they could see the musket of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom . they fastened one end of the rope which brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron bars which they had just wrenched off . flung the other over the outer wall , crossed the abyss at one bound . clung to the coping of the wall .
did ever pirate did ever maiden wake how beautifully blue loathed from dream of homely the sky , etc . forsake his hideous duty , mission to find her daylight to find himself break betrothed with such exceeding to lady of position , beauty ? girls : no , we must not lose our senses . if they stick at no offences we should not be here ! piracy their dreadful trade is -- nice companions for young ladies !
a cry of protest broke from the appalled nutty . but [female] did not hear it , she had left the room and was on her way downstairs . lord dawlish was smoking an after breakfast cigar in the grounds . it was a beautiful day , and a peaceful happiness had come upon him . he told himself that he had made progress .
seated thus one day , she was softly touched on the shoulder . and [female] said , `` well , [female] dear , '' and took her seat at her side , their seat was a part of the window . when there was anything in the way of a procession going on . they used to have bright draperies hung out of the window .
struck to the heart with shame and resentment at what he had heard . sir [male] was about to attempt his escape from the tent at all hazards . when what followed arrested his purpose , one of the other voices was then heard to mutter something of the lady [male] 's prudence and wisdom . a figure , as if entering the apartment , cast upon the partition a shade . which glided along slowly until it mixed with those which already clouded it , despite of the bitter disappointment which he had experienced .
[male] was so good humoured , that even his manifest faults , -- shooting carelessly , lying in bed and wanting his dinner . were , if not forgiven , at least endured , but [male] was an abomination . he could shoot well enough and was active , and when he was at the work seemed to like it . but he would stay away whole days by himself . and when spoken to would answer in a manner which seemed to [male] to be flat mutiny .
and indeed poor [female] was not so very bad ; but behaved very well for her . she was much to be pitied , poor thing , and great allowances made for her . as belonging to a well grown family , and a very comely one ; and feeling her own shortcomings . this made her leap to the other extreme , and reassert herself too much . endeavouring to exalt the mind at the expense of the body .
they began to love one another again , often , even in the middle of the day . emma suddenly wrote to him , then from the window made a sign to justin . who , taking his apron off , quickly ran to [male] huchette . [female] would come ; she had sent for him to tell him that she was bored . that her husband was odious , her life frightful .
captain west may be a samurai . but he is also human , he was really a bit fluttery this morning . in his reserved , controlled way , when he regretted the plague of vermin i had encountered in my rooms . it seems he has a keen sense of hospitality . and that he is my host on the elsinore .
wheel spokes whirred in the air and he saw a buggy . with the top down , rattling down another street in a cloud of dust . it was the same buggy in which he had first seen the black bearded senator seven years before . it was the same horse , too , and the arab like face and the bushy [male] whiskers . save for streaks of gray , were the same , this was the man who used to buy watches and pianos by the dozen .
it was a cavalry general who had obtained the emperor 's special favor during this campaign . and who had formerly commanded the division in which rostov was serving , rostov , in dismay . began justifying himself , but seeing the kindly , jocular face of the general , he took him aside and in an excited voice told him the whole affair . asking him to intercede for denisov , whom the general knew . having heard rostov to the end , the general shook his head gravely .
archer leaned for a while against the gate , no one was in sight . and not a sound came from the open windows of the house . a grizzled newfoundland dozing before the door seemed as ineffectual a guardian as the arrowless cupid . it was strange to think that this place of silence and decay was the home of the turbulent blenkers . yet archer was sure that he was not mistaken , for a long time he stood there .
he looked round at her and saw that she was very young . sixteen , perhaps , at the most , and that she had once , -- nay very lately . been exquisitely pretty , there still lingered about her eyes some remains of that look of perfect innocency and pure faith which had been hers not more than twelve months since . and now , at midnight , in the middle of the streets . she was praying for a pennyworth of gin .
but he had also his more serious moments , and could talk to her of serious matters . he would read to her , and explain to her things which had hitherto been too hard for her young intelligence . his voice , too , was [female] , and well under command . it could be pathetic if pathos were required , or ring with laughter as [female] as her own . was not such a man fit to be an [female] to such a girl .
monny was pale , even the fresh young rose that was her mouth had blanched . otherwise she controlled herself perfectly , was this part of [male] 's plan , i wondered . he had told me what he intended to do at the palace ball tomorrow night . but he had said nothing about this preliminary scene . i understood , however , why he had not manoeuvred to get [male] to himself .
they descended the stair with slow and solemn step . traversed a long gallery , and , by a pair of folding doors placed at the end . entered the great hall in which the grand master had for the time established his court of justice . the lower part of this ample apartment was filled with squires and yeomen . who made way not without some difficulty for [female] .
the silence of death quickened the beating of his heart when he stopped to listen . there was no doubt that langlois lay dead in his little home , jan brought dry brushwood from the forest . and piled it high against the logs , upon his sledge he sat and watched the fire until the cabin was a furnace of leaping flame . he continued westward , at the head of the porcupine he found the remains of three burned wigwams . and from one of them he dug out charred bones .
make your need known , his hand was open , put your grief into words . he turned no deaf ear , expect refinements of perception . miracles of intuition , and realize disappointment . this night , when [male] entered the room . and met the evening lamp , i saw well and at one glance his whole mechanism .
and so [female] thorne learnt music at greshamsbury . and with her music she learnt other things also . how to behave herself among girls of her own age . how to speak and talk as other young ladies do ; how to dress herself . and how to move and walk , all which , she , being quick to learn .
at last , seated on a stile at the back of the mill hill stables . while [male] stood close before him with both his hands in his pockets . he did get his story told , it was by no means the first time that [male] had heard about [male] thorne . and he was not , therefore , so surprised as he might have been , had the affair been new to him . and thus , standing there in the position we have described , did mr [male] .
lucy 's sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature . she kept it without hypocrisy in the morning . and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon . as she changed her frock . she wondered whether [female] was sneering at her ; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him .
when a woman stands on her hands and feet like a quadruped . and her lover mounts her like a bull , it is called the `` congress of a cow . '' at this time everything that is ordinarily done on the bosom should be done on the back . in the same way can be carried on the congress of a dog . the congress of a goat , the congress of a deer .
`` i shall never see you , mrs , considine , '' she was still mrs. considine to him . for answer she only took his hand and smiled . if the holidays at christmas had been a desolation to gabrielle . her parting from [female] next easter was clouded by a sense of more positive want . it was the season of lovers .
while they were speaking , the archduke of [female] . who stood a little apart , was struck with the mention of iced sherbet . and took with pleasure and some bluntness the deep goblet , as the earl of huntingdon was about to replace it . `` most delicious , '' he exclaimed , after a deep draught , which the heat of the weather . and the feverishness following the debauch of the preceding day .
i am very glad to have the opportunity of shaking hands with you , ', said [male] . and then he retired , as it had become his duty to wait with his arm ready for mrs. [female] . having married an earl 's daughter he was selected for that honour . there was a barrister in the room , and mrs. [female] ought to have known better . as she professed to be guided in such matters by the rules laid down by the recognized authorities .
next morning i found him up and dressed . looking like a spectre , indeed ; but with health , courage , and hope in his eyes . even my father noticed it , when at dinner time . with [female] 's help -- poor old [female] ! how proud she was -- [male] crawled downstairs .
the miss bertrams were now fully established among the belles of the neighbourhood . and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirements a manner naturally easy . and carefully formed to general civility and obligingness , they possessed its favour as well as its admiration . their vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it . and gave themselves no airs ; while the praises attending such behaviour .
many happy returns of my birthday to you , dearest ! that is all that my birthdays are for , have you been happy today , i wonder ? and am wondering also whether this evening we shall see you walking quietly in and making everything into perfection that has been trembling just on the verge of it all day long . one drawback of my feast is that i have to write short to you . for there are other correspondents who on this occasion look for quick answers .
in the first place he would tell his son that his threats were withdrawn . and would ask him to remain at cosby lodge , he would write the letter as he passed through barchester . on his way home , so that his son might receive it on the following morning . and he would refer the [male] to his mother for a full explanation of the circumstances . those odious bills must be removed from every barn door and wall in the county .
now , when he met him , the man . who then seemed already extremely weary , had requested him to take him on his crupper . to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait . this fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded jacquin [male] . and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the cross of colbas .
`` go , then , '' she said with a charming smile , which accompanied him until he had disappeared . monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilian 's room . when he reached the landing he listened attentively . but all was still , like many old houses occupied by a single family , the room door was panelled with glass . but it was locked , maximilian was shut in , and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room .
these things i do not understand ; having seen so much of robbery , that i scarcely know . as here we say , one crow 's foot from the other . it is beyond me and above me . to discuss these subjects ; and in truth i love the law right well . when it doth support me , and when i can lay it down to my liking .
built of granite , and rising only one story high . it stands in the midst of the grassy solitude . it is in a perfectly good condition as far as exterior is concerned ; the walls are thick and the roof is sound . not a stone is wanting in the sides , not a tile upon the roof . a brick built chimney stack forms the angle of the roof .
peter caught her in his arms . turning his back , [male] , and saw , and realized that the cow was too big and had appeared too precipitately . and bellowed too loudly , he should have begun on the smallest calf on the place . he rushed the cow back to junior . and himself to peaches , who , sobbing wildly , still clung to [male] .
though she was by no means prepared to tell [male] vavasor that any such discussion had taken place . from the concert , and the effect which lady midlothian 's countenance might have upon mr [organization] future welfare . she got herself by degrees round to a projected swiss tour which [female] was about to make . of this swiss tour she had heard before , but had not heard who were to be miss vavasor 's companions until lady midlothian had told her . how it had come to pass that lady midlothian had interested herself so much in the concerns of a person whom she did not know .
`` one , '' said the count mysteriously , his eyes fixed on the corpse . disfigured by so awful a death , ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived . the one accompanied by the porter , the other by [male] , and were received by the abbe busoni . who was praying by the side of the corpse , the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout [location] for the next fortnight . the dying man had signed a deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin .
the other was almost useless , the ambulance was still waiting outside , at the foot of the staircase . there were voices and lights in the operating room . forward along the tiled hall , still in his night clothing . [male] got into the ambulance and threw his uniform behind him . then he got the car under way .
mr. [male] , who loved the art of the past . was reminded of a favourite theme , the santa conversazione . in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble things . a theme neither sensual nor sensational , and therefore ignored by the art of today . why should [female] want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home ?
the door closed , and the carriage rolled softly through the snow . and back returned the countess , pensive and anxious , she did listen , and watch . when evening closed ; but it was in stillest sort : walking the drawing room with quite noiseless step . she checked at intervals her velvet march . inclined her ear , and consulted the night sounds .
one day he caught sight of [female] and her brother . he was inpaul 's , he had entered the cathedral partly to avoid the rain and partly to see a picture that had educated him in former years . but the light was bad , the picture ill placed . and time and judgment were inside him now . death alone still charmed him , with her lap of poppies .
like you , i have come , not to join the hunt . but to see it pass , said the prince , bowing low to the beautiful queen . and he asked to be allowed to wait with her and the little maid . as they waited , three people , a lady . a knight and a dwarf , came out of the forest .
the philosophers view had just carried the day . the discussion having been held under seven or eight wet umbrellas at the corner of a dirty little lane leading into the high street . when suddenly , on the other side of the way , mr. [male] 's cortège made its appearance . the philosophers at once informed them that on such occasions it was customary that the rival candidates should be introduced . `` it will take ten minutes , '' said the philosophers .
however , that wish was not hearty neither , for i loved my lancashire husband entirely . as indeed i had ever done from the beginning ; and he merited from me as much as it was possible for a man to do . but that by the way , this was all strange news to me . and things i had not been used to ; and really my heart began to look up more seriously than i think it ever did before . and to look with great thankfulness to the hand of providence .
it was early on a fine summer 's day . near the end of the eighteenth century , when a young man . of genteel appearance , journeying towards the north east of [location] . provided himself with a ticket in one of those public carriages which travel between edinburgh and the queensferry . at which place , as the name implies .
as lovers have walked since the days of eden they walked together . no longer duke and duchess , but man and woman . near to paradise as human beings may draw until god breaks the chain binding them to earth . and , indeed , it would seem that such hours are given to the straining human soul that it may know that somewhere perfect joy must be . since sometimes the gates are for a moment opened that heaven 's light may shine through .
a slight embarrassment fell on them , and her hand slipped out of his . it was the only time that he had kissed her on the lips except for their fugitive embrace in the beaufort conservatory . and he saw that she was [female] . and shaken out of her cool boyish composure , all this kept her very busy . and she had not had time to do more than look at the little vellum book that archer had sent her the week before ( the sonnets from the portuguese ', ) .
he enjoyed burlesque shows . billiards , and [male] , and was always looking back upon his last intrigue or forward to his next one . in his youth his taste had run to loud ties . but now it seemed to have faded , like his vitality , and was expressed in pale lilac four in hands and indeterminate gray collars . [male] was listlessly struggling that losing struggle against mental , moral , and physical anamia that takes place ceaselessly on the lower fringe of the middle classes .
if the child had been felipe 's own , he could not have felt for it a greater love . from the first , the little thing had clung to him as only second to her mother . she slept hours in his arms . one little hand hid in his dark beard . close to his lips , and kissed again and again when no one saw .
after which , she tugged at his coat with both hands . and pulled him all askew in buttoning that garment over the precious waistcoat pocket . and then tied her dimples into her bonnet strings in a very knowing way . and took him back to [location] , arrived at mr [male] 's door . she set him with his back against it .
[male] was not inclined , after a little observation , to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill natured or ill bred as he wished to appear . his temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding , like many others of his sex . that through some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty . he was the husband of a very silly woman . but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it. .
how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room ! seeing , however , no one there except a musketeer of his own troop . he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier . in whose dress , nevertheless , he recognized at the first glance the cardinal . the lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture , such as became a man of good birth .
for an instant after he was safely in the car he was too dazed to think . it seemed as if he must keep on blindly rushing through that train all the way to [location] . or she would get away from him , he sat down in an empty seat for a minute to get his senses . he was actually on the train , it had not gone without him ! but there was no time to consider such questions now , he had started on this [male] .
however , in spite of all my regrets , the fire went up very merrily . blazing red and white and yellow , as it leaped on different things , and the light danced on the snow drifts with a misty lilac hue . i was astonished at its burning in such mighty depths of snow . but gwenny said that the wicked men had been three days hard at work . clearing , as it were , a cock pit , for their fire to have its way .
i whistled , i had a dim recollection that during my grandfather 's long widowerhood there were occasional reports that he was about to marry . the name of miss [female] had been mentioned in this connection . i had heard it spoken of in my family . and not , i remembered , with much kindness , later , i heard of her joining a sisterhood . and opening a school somewhere in the west , provided , further , that in the event of the marriage of said [female] to the said [female] .
the note had been thrown into ramona 's room . she was hot and cold with fear lest she might not be able to get it unobserved . what if the [female] were to go first into the room , she hardly dared look at her . but fortune is not always on the side of tyrants . the [female] was fast dozing off again , relieved that felipe was out of speaking distance of ramona .
it seemed almost like an interposition of providence that two days after dicky 's bombshell . his mother received a letter from her daughter [female] asking her to go to [location] for the rest of the winter . one of the children had been ordered south by the family physician . and dicky 's sister was to accompany her little daughter . while the other children remained at home under the care of their father and his mother .
habit had given him quite an artistic touch for this kind of thing . and he did his work fondly , like some enthusiastic horticulturist who gives his anxious days to the budding forth of some new orchid or the production of a hitherto unobtainable tulip . it is doubtful whether money procured from any other source was ever half so sweet to this gentleman as the cash for which he paid sixty per cent to the jews . with these proclivities he managed to rub on from year to year somehow . getting about five hundred per annum in solid value out of an income of seven .
why should we doubt the evidence of dreams ? for what is our life , occupied as it is with vain and fleeting imaginations . other than a prolonged vision of the night ? the governor took care of domingo and [male] . who were no longer able to labour , and who survived their mistresses but a short time . as for poor fidele , he pined to death .
but that was nonsense , who would really mind their giving wrong ages in order to be married for love ! she ate hardly any breakfast , and went back to whitaker . the more she studied the less sure she became ; till , idly turning the pages . she came to scotland , people could be married there without any of this nonsense . she had only to go and stay there twenty one days , then jon could come .
now the climate of this country is -- so far as i can make of it . to throw no man into extremes ; and if he throw himself so far . to pluck him back by change of weather and the need of looking after things . lest we should be like the southerns , for whom the sky does everything . and men sit under a wall and watch both food and fruit come beckoning .
now these fine trees had taken advantage of the west winds . and the moisture , and the promise of the spring time . so as to fill the tips of the spray wood and the rowels all up the branches with a crowd of eager blossom . not that they were yet in bloom , nor even showing whiteness . only that some of the cones were opening at the side of the cap which pinched them .
her south view , between these two stretches of sea . was another hill , higher than [location] , the last of the little peninsula . with the bland turrets of a smaller and uninhabited castle on the top . on which the setting sun still shone when everything else was sunk in shadow . yes , she was very comfortably established here ; and receptacles -- mrs. [female] did not examine their nature closely .
although they had guarded from the others the happenings of the previous evening . between them loomed a barrier of mutual amazement and reproach . beneath his attempted optimism willie was wounded and indignant that he should have been deceived by those in whose kindness he had believed so whole heartedly . he fought the facts with loyalty . obstinately trusting that some satisfactory explanation would be forthcoming , but he did not understand .
`` do you ? then i do not think you can know the meaning of the word [male] . '' if i were a man , that woman would be precisely the last in the world to touch my heart . o yes , i admit that she is very handsome -- classic profile , bright blue eyes . complexion of lilies and roses . real golden hair -- not dyed , you know -- and so on ; but i should as soon think of falling in love with a statue of snow as with lady geraldine challoner .
everybody in elherthal who was anybody would be at this ball . i had already been at one like it , as well as at several of the less select and rougher entertainments . and i found a pleasure which was somewhat strange even to myself in standing to one side and watching the motley throng and the formal procession which was every year organized by the artists who had the management of the proceedings . the ball began at the timely hour of seven ; about nine i enveloped myself in my domino . and took my way across the road to the scene of the festivities .
`` ommh , '' said mr. [male] , slowly . i do not either , only i did not understand they were engaged , it 's my business to find and distribute news . and get it fresh , `` scoop it , '' as our term is , and so , mickey , when investigations are going on . and everybody knows a denou -- a big surprise is coming .
stepan arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views . these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves . just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat . but simply took those that were being worn , and for him , living in a certain society . owing to the need , ordinarily developed at years of discretion .
as he came closer , they could see he was hardly more than a boy . perhaps twenty years of age , his lean , gray body was nearly naked . around his waist he wore a drab colored tunic . of a substance they could not identify , his feet and legs were bare . on his chest were strapped a thin stone plate , slightly convex .
but it had fallen into disuse now , and scarcely any one at audley court knew whether the spring had dried up or not . but sheltered as was the solitude of this lime tree walk , i doubt very much if it was ever put to any romantic uses . often in the cool of the evening sir [male] would stroll up and down smoking his cigar . with his dogs at his heels , and his pretty young wife dawdling by his side . but in about ten minutes the baronet and his companion would grow tired of the rustling limes and the still water .
when hareton was there , she generally paused in an interesting part . and left the book lying about : that she did repeatedly ; but he was as obstinate as a mule . and , instead of snatching at her bait , in wet weather he took to smoking with [female] . and they sat like automatons , one on each side of the fire . the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense , as he would have called it .
her tone implied , even to [female] 's rough perceptions . that there was a good deal more of a difference between them than therein lay . but common people , whether lords or shopkeepers . are slow to understand that possession , whether in the shape of birth . or lands , or money , or intellect , is a small affair in the difference between men .
but she was more absorbed -- or , rather , she returned every instant to the man who walked beside her with such an air and talked so loudly and cheerfully . certainly , it seemed to her , his disguise was perfect , and himself the best part of it . she compared him in her mind with a couple of ministers . splendid and awful in their gowns and ruffs . whom they had met turning into one of the churches just now , and smiled at the comparison .
be cautious not to marry , as you say , a dunce , but seek the partner whom god has made for you . there are souls , believe me , who are fit to appreciate you . and to make you happy , if i were rich , if you were poor . i would lay my heart and my fortunes at your feet . for i believe your soul to be full of riches and of loyalty .
his last words that evening were a hopeful remark that all might be well with her yet . that mr. [male] would not intrude upon her life . if he found that his presence cost her so much pain . then the window was closed , the shutters folded , and the rustle of his footsteps died away . no sooner had she retired to rest that night than the wind began to rise .
at last she arose and came toward the doctor , with a strange sweetness playing about her mouth . and a strange calm in her voice , and the doctor . feeling that all words were vain and useless , silently bowed , and softly let himself out of the room . the first thing upon which ester 's eye alighted when she turned again to the table was the letter in which she had been writing those last words . `` why life is not half long enough for the things that i want to do . ''
immediately the twenty men rushed forward , seizing pails . buckets , jars , barrels , and extinguishing the fire with as much ardor as they had . an instant before , employed in promoting it , but already , and before all the rest . [male] had applied a ladder to the house . crying , [male] , it is i , [male] ! do not kill me .
a very few minutes brought him up with lovel . who , perhaps anticipating his intention , had not put his horse beyond a slow walk . when the clatter of hoofs behind him announced captain [male] . the young soldier , his natural heat of temper exasperated by the rapidity of motion . reined his horse up suddenly and violently by lovel 's side .
major grantly drove his gig into the yard of the `` red lion '' at allington , and from thence walked away at once to mrs. [female] 's house . when he reached the village he had hardly made up his mind as to the way in which he would begin his attack . but now , as he went down the street , he resolved that he would first ask for mrs. [male] . most probably he would find himself in the presence of mrs. [female] and her daughter .
true love , in the cave man . is expressed by a desire to beat a woman , and to pull her around by the hair . true love , in the broadwayite , is expressed by an insatiable craving to buy things for a woman . true love , in a husband , is expressed by his willingness to give his wife anything . from the tenderest piece of steak to a divorce .
he really did not care enough , as much as he cared , the last hour came . when having made excuses to this and that neighbor , when having spread the information that they were going abroad . when [male] had engaged rooms at the auditorium . and the mass of furniture which could not be used had gone to storage , that it was necessary to say farewell to this hyde park domicile . [male] had visited sandwood in company with [male] several times .
she could not see him distinctly , as he was hidden by the other man 's broad shoulders . but she did not regret it , because the warm brown tints of her furs against the background of snow and foliage might warn him of her presence . she thanked the kindly stars that brought her here , no matter what turn events took now . she hoped to hold the whip hand over bower . there was a mystery to be cleared , of course ; but with such materials she could hardly fail to discover its true bearings .
this is your [male] , mr. [male] . it is well that you know him too . and remember his great kindness to us , but mrs. [female] could not speak . she could only sink on the sofa , and hide her face . while she strove in vain to repress her sobs .
after all , what was there but vulgarity in taking the fact that [male] was a poor jewish workman . and that he was to be met perhaps on a sanded floor in the parlor of the hand and banner as a reason for determining beforehand that there was not some spiritual force within him that might have a determining effect on a white handed gentleman ? there is a legend told of the emperor [male] . that having heard of a jewish family , of the house of [male] . whence the ruler of the world was to spring .
[male] and i talk philosophy and art on the poop of a stately ship in a circle of flashing sea . while captain west dreams of his far home . and mr. [male] and mr. [male] stand watch and watch and snarl orders . and the slaves of men pull and haul . and possum has fits , and andy fay and mulligan jacobs burn with hatred unconsumable .
a splendid midsummer shone over england . skies so pure , suns so radiant as were then seen in long succession . seldom favour even singly , our wave girt land , it was as if a band of italian days had come from the south . like a flock of glorious passenger birds . and lighted to rest them on the cliffs of albion .
he shuddered , and looked back , the little brown horse and the little brown girl were one with the little brown station so far away . and presently the saloon and men were blotted out in one blur of green and brown and yellow . he looked to the ground in his despair . he must go back , he could not leave her in such peril . she was his to care for by all the rights of manhood and womanhood .
two days later , on the fifteenth of july . an immense number of carriages were standing outside the sloboda palace . the great halls were full , in the first were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms . in the second bearded merchants in full skirted coats of blue cloth and wearing medals . in the noblemen 's hall there was an incessant movement and buzz of voices .
for a moment , although we were twice their number . we fell back before their valorous fame , and the power of their onset . for my part , admiring their courage greatly , and counting it slur upon manliness that two should be down upon one so . i withheld my hand awhile ; for i cared to meet none but carver . and he was not among them , the whirl and hurry of this fight .
the yorkists began to be scattered ; several times [male] found himself alone among his foes and plying his bright sword for life . several times he was conscious of a hurt . and meanwhile the fight swayed to and fro in the street without determinate result . suddenly [male] was aware of a great trumpeting about the outskirts of the town . the war cry of york began to be rolled up to heaven , as by many and triumphant voices .
yes ; but in order to avenge herself she must be free . and to be free , a prisoner has to pierce a wall , detach bars . cut through a floor -- all undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish . but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way . besides , to do all this , time is necessary -- months , years .
her dress was in keeping with the splendor around her : a rich robe of yellow silk fastened up the front with large carbuncle buttons . sleeves of deep valenciennes lace fell far over her jewelled fingers . and a scarf of golden embroidery , negligently thrown over an arm of her chair . gave what a painter would call the warm color to a very striking picture . farther from the window , and carefully protected from the air by a screen .
the closet into which [female] and [female] had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only . and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room . whilst the aperture between the two hangings , small as it was . permitted them to see , during the recital [female] entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen . `` well , '' said the queen , when the chancellor had finished speaking .
this , with his great mass of [male] curly hair . was some trouble to him in combing and washing out the stone dust that settled on it in the pursuit of his trade . his capabilities in the latter , having been acquired in the country . were of an all round sort , including monumental stone cutting , gothic free stone work for the restoration of churches . and carving of a general kind , in [location] he would probably have become specialized and have made himself a `` moulding mason , ''
i promised very readily to do my best to serve him , but , of course . would take no money for it , not being so poor as that came to . [male] , on the day following , i managed to set the men at work on the other side of the farm . especially that inquisitive and busybody [male] , who would pry out almost anything for the pleasure of telling his wife . and then , with uncle reuben mounted on my ancient peggy .
`` i hope nothing more exciting will happen then than to night , '' [female] exclaimed . with a kindly glance at her companion , she pitied him . but she pitied herself more , for by and by she and [female] would have to talk this thing out together . [female] and [female] had a suite of rooms on the ground floor in what was known as `` the new wing '' at valley house , on the floor above were the rooms occupied by lord and lady annesley seton .
he held her to him . and the currents flowed between them warm and full as on the night of their moon over como . in a trice , after that , she had the matter in hand and her forces marshalled . the taxi was paid , [female] 's luggage deposited in the vestibule . and the children , just piling down to breakfast , were summoned in to hear the news .
it was on tuesday that [female] armitage had appeared before her in the pergola . it was now thursday afternoon , and chauvenet had been to see her twice since . and she had met him the night before at a dance at one of the cottages . judge [male] was distinguished for his acute and sinewy mind . but he had , too , a strong feeling for art in all its expressions .
in the morning he was still brooding over the message . and as they travelled through the [male] desert on the way to ghardaia and the hidden cities of the m'zab . he fell into long silences , then , abruptly , he would rouse himself to gaiety and animation . telling old legends or new tales , strange dramas of the desert . very seldom comedies ; for there are few comedies in the sahara .
the parchment was three feet across , the steel rings round it were like the hoops of a dog cart . and the [female] drumsticks , according to [female] . were like the bullet heads of two niggers . jonaique jelly played the clarionet , and [male] the widow played the trombone . but the drum was the leading instrument , [male] himself played it .
the letter was right there at hand in the drawer of the little table upon which edna had just placed her coffee cup . mademoiselle opened the drawer and drew forth the letter . the topmost one , she placed it in edna 's hands . and without further comment arose and went to the piano . mademoiselle played a soft interlude , it was an improvisation .
for a moment they seemed on the verge of an altogether desperate scuffle . never for a moment had violence come between these two since long ago he had . in spite of her mother 's protest in the background . carried her kicking and squalling to the nursery for some forgotten crime . with something near to horror they found themselves thus confronted .
by the second week , everyone knew perfectly well what was going on , yet everyone tried to look as if they were stone blind to the changes in jo 's face . they never asked why she sang about her work . did up her hair three times a day . and got so blooming with her evening exercise , and no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that professor bhaer . while talking philosophy with the father , was giving the daughter lessons in love .
tears rose into the boy 's eyes . for he was not among the regular day scholars . who came unromantically close to the schoolmaster 's life , but one who had attended the night school only during the present teacher 's term of office . the regular scholars , if the truth must be told , stood at the present moment afar off . like certain historic disciples , indisposed to any enthusiastic volunteering of aid .
now coming into the kitchen with all my cash in my breeches pocket ( golden guineas . with an elephant on them , for the stamp of the guinea company ) . i found dear mother most heartily glad to see me safe and sound again -- for she had dreaded that giant . and dreamed of him -- and she never asked me about the money . [male] also was softer , and more gracious than usual ; especially when she saw me pour guineas .
to a man of my sentiments it is unspeakably gratifying to be able to say this . the sentiments which animate my heart assure me that the lines i have just written express a profound truth . those sentiments exalt me above all merely personal considerations . i bear witness , in the most disinterested manner , to the excellence of the stratagem by which this unparalleled woman surprised the private interview between [female] and myself . also to the marvellous accuracy of her report of the whole conversation from its beginning to its end .
in the midst of this seeming hilarity , nevertheless , people 's minds were uneasy . was [female] to remain the favorite and minister of the queen ? was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there ? every one hoped so , so that the minister felt that all around him , beneath the homage of the courtiers . lay a fund of hatred , ill disguised by fear and interest .
the greenhorn 's next maneuver was to swing the animal round till he lost his head . then clap heels to him and send him off as if he had business for the day laid out ahead of him . it was the most amazing start that anybody ever had been known to make on [male] . and the most startling and enjoyable thing about it was that this strange . overgrown boy , with his open face and guileless speech .
moreover , it was not his body alone which seemed fashioned after the cathedral , but his mind also . in what condition was that mind ? what bent had it contracted . what form had it assumed beneath that knotted envelope . in that savage life ? this it would be hard to determine . quasimodo had been born one-eyed , hunchbacked , lame , it was with great difficulty .
it was a large room with a [female] over the fireplace and rows upon rows of books in covers of light gold and dark gold and shiny red . all the chairs had little lace squares where one 's head should rest . the couch was just comfortable , the books looked as if they had been read . some -- and sally carrol had an instantaneous vision of the battered old library at home . with her father 's huge medical books , and the oil paintings of her three great uncles .
soon after this was done [male] came to king [male] and told him of the dolorous stroke that balin gave to king pellam . and how balin and balan fought together the marvellest battle that ever was heard of . and how they were buried both in one tomb , alas , said king [male] . this is the greatest pity that ever i heard tell of two knights . for in the world i know not such two knights .
a dutch pike broke some links of his mail and dealt him a flesh wound which went unheeded by him in his fury . a dutch rapier found the breach thus made in his de fences . and went through it to stretch him bleeding upon the deck . yet he staggered up , knowing as full as did they that if he succumbed then all was lost . armed now with a short axe which he had found under his hand when he went down .
the order for his arrest was [male] despatched . the district attorney forwarded it to [male] sur [male] by a special messenger . at full speed , and entrusted its execution to police inspector javert . the reader knows that javert had returned to [male] sur [male] immediately after having given his deposition . javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner .
the long monotony of her illness had made her lose all count of time . when [male] left england , his idea was to coast round africa on the eastern side until he reached the cape . and thence to make what further journey or voyage might seem to him best in pursuit of his scientific objects . to cape town all his letters had been addressed of late ; and there , two months before . he had received the intelligence of osborne 's death .
between sobs [male] confessed that the prospect of parting with him and not midget was provocative of her woe . this staggered bryce and pleased him immensely , and at parting she kissed him good-bye . reiterating her opinion that he was the nicest , kindest boy she had ever met or hoped to meet . the succeeding years of [organization] life . until he completed his high school studies and went east to [location] .
as the sermon rolled on its majestic course , the congregation listened with an attentive and discriminating appreciation that testified to their earnestness and intelligence . true , one here and there dropped into a momentary doze , but his slumber was never easy . for he was harassed by the terrible fear of a sudden summons by name from the pulpit to `` awake and give heed to the message , '' which for the next few minutes would have an application so personal and pungent that it would effectually prevent sleep for that and some successive sabbaths . the only apparent lapse of attention occurred when [male] opened his horn snuff box .
[female] had become so used to the story now , that it excited no strong feelings within her . her wish , she said , was , that the matter should be settled , the lawyer . with almost a smile on his face , but still shaking his head . said that he feared it could not be settled before the end of april . [male] sat by , leaning his face , as usual , upon his umbrella .
on a day soon after the return of lorry and anguish from a trip to the frontier . beverly expressed a desire to visit the monastery ofvalentine . high on the mountain top , it was a long ride over the circuitous route by which the steep incline was avoided and it was necessary for the party to make an early start . yetive rode with [male] and his wife the countess . while beverly 's companion was the gallant colonel quinnox .
aucassin dwelt in the castle of torelore . in great ease and great delight , for that he had with him nicolete his sweet love . whom he loved so well , now while he was in such pleasure and such delight . came a troop of saracens by sea . and laid siege to the castle and took it by main strength .
of what faults , even if we analyse her faults . has she been guilty ? where she has been weak , who among [female] is not . in that , weak also ? of what vanity has she been guilty with which the least vain among [male] might not justly tax himself ? having been left alone in the world , she has looked to make friends for herself . and in seeking for new friends she has wished to find the best that might come in her way .
ap , my dear sister , i do not envy you . though i remember when i did -- but that was when i was a younger sun . i do not think i am quite well , perhaps a little change of air will do me good . i have a mind to show myself in [location] this winter . they will be very glad to see me , no , i sha not go out today .
a broad door of brass , fronting the garden . stood partly open , and the chemist pushed it wide and ushered in his friends . they found themselves now in a triangular hallway . or lobby , with an open arch in both its other sides giving passage into rooms beyond . through one of these archways the chemist led them .
and soon as sir [male] came within the abbey yard , the daughter of king bagdemagus heard a great horse go on the pavement . and she then arose and yede unto a window , and there she saw sir [female] . and anon she made men fast to take his horse from him and let lead him into a stable . and himself was led into a fair chamber , and unarmed him . and the lady sent him a long gown .
ye shall cause me to be the more hardy , what adventure so befall me . i will not wit my lady to be in no jeopardy , sir , said she . i am at your commandment , and shall be ready what time so ye be ready . so on the morn the king and the queen departed with such fellowship as they had . and came into the north , into a forest beside humber .
this pressing is used in the case of a young girl when her lover shampoos her . scratches her head , and wants to trouble or frighten her . the curved mark with the nails , which is impressed on the neck and the breasts . is called the `` half moon , '' when the half moons are impressed opposite to each other . it is called a `` circle , '' this mark with the nails is generally made on the navel .
that body , robbed by him of life . was their love , the first stage of their love . there was something awful and revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful price of shame . shame at their spiritual nakedness crushed her and infected him . but in spite of all the murderer 's horror before the body of his victim .
she hated herself now , in those earlier days she had always nourished a secret contempt for girls who were the slaves of the first good-looking young fellow who should choose to salute them . she had never taken kindly to the idea of marriage in the abstract as did the majority of women she saw about her . in the turmoil of her anxiety for her lover she had agreed to marry him . but the perception that had accompanied her happiest hours on this account was rather that of self sacrifice than of promotion and honour . although she scarcely knew the divinity 's name .
while wandering in solitude , i would sometimes picture the present probable position of others , my acquaintance . there was madame [female] at a cheerful watering place with her children . her mother , and a whole troop of friends who had sought the same scene of relaxation . zeliepierre was at [location] , with her relatives . the other teachers were at their homes , there was [female] .
instantly he unlocked a small gate at his right . i passed in and , with professional sang froid , proceeded to take my way to the house through the double row of evergreens bordering the semicircular approach . as these trees stood very close together and were , besides , heavily laden with fresh fallen snow . i failed to catch a glimpse of the building itself until i stood in front of it . then i saw that it was brilliantly lighted and gave evidence here and there of some festivity .
there are some periods which offer to the backward glance of memory rather a blur of blended color than a distinct picture . a rich and shining tapestry in which no one thread can be distinguished . so always to allard seemed that first week in the country he learned to call home . the stately ceremonies of stanief 's reception and assumption of the regency . the dazzle and pageantry of the court even when thus subdued by mourning .
that night , for almost the first time since he had adopted his dual role . loder slept ill , he was not a man over whom imagination held any powerful sway . his doubts and misgivings seldom ran to speculation . upon future possibilities ; nevertheless , the fact that , consciously or unconsciously , he had adopted a new attitude towards eve came home to him with unpleasant force during the hours of darkness . and long before the first hint of daylight had slipped through the heavy window curtains he had arranged a plan of action .
and then she plunged into the tete a tete of the other two , making the conversation general . osborne was rather discomfited at the non success of his congratulations . he had pictured to himself the unbosoming of a love sick girl . full of rapture , and glad of a sympathizing confidant . he little knew [female] 's nature .
it would hardly suit him to postpone his courtship indefinitely . knowing , as he did know , that he would be one among many suitors . he could not expect her to wait for him if he did not declare himself . and yet he could hardly ask her to come and share with him the allowance made to him by his father ! whether she had much fortune of her own , or little , or none at all .
that day sir [male] sent a messenger to elsalill . and he brought her a heavy armlet of gold . when elsalill saw him and heard him speak she could not bring herself to tell him that she was sad at heart and would part from him . all the sorrows which gnawed at her were forgotten as she sat listening to sir [female] . the next day was a sunday , and elsalill went to church .
but now as he walked home in the middle of the night from [male] street to cavendish square he did think much of himself . indeed such self thoughts come naturally to all men , be their outward conduct ever so reckless . every man to himself is the centre of the whole world . the axle on which it all turns . all knowledge is but his own perception of the things around him .
it was only when another and a fiercer jealousy was awakened in this woman 's breast . that she arose all at once , strong , resolute , and undaunted , to do the work she had so miserably deferred . as one poison is said to neutralise the evil power of another , so [location] [female] 's jealousy of [female] seemed to blot out and extinguish her hatred of [female] . better anything than that [female] arundel should have a new . and perhaps a fairer , bride , the jealous woman had always looked upon [female] as a despicable rival .
after dinner , the young gentlemen were left by themselves in the dining room . where they soon became very [female] and made a good deal of noise . chancing to pass through the hall , i found [female] sitting alone on the lowest step of the staircase . her eyes fixed on the glossy panels of the dining room door . where the reflection of the hall lamp was shining ; her little brow knit in anxious , meditation .
an extra can of hot water happens to stand at the door ; and therein he deposits his treasure . and retires saying nothing , the consequence is , when i open three minutes after his scratch . i find you all ungummed and swimming , your beautiful handwriting bleared and smeared . so that no eye but mine could have read it . benjy 's shame when i showed him what he had done was wonderful .
and then mrs. [female] would branch off into a graphic description of her own maladies . to which [female] was fain to listen patiently , wondering vaguely as she listened whether the lapse of years would render her as wearisome a person as mrs. [male] . up to this time mr. [male] had had some reason to be disappointed with the result of his daughter 's marriage . so far as his own prosperity was affected thereby , not a sixpence beyond that one advance of the two hundred pounds had the bailiff been able to extort from his son in law . it was the price that mr. [male] had paid for his wife .
even the anger was clouded from his eye ; he had become a stay at home . dozing for the most part of the day by a fire . even in that july weather ; his longest walk was to the little grey church which stood naked upon a mound some quarter of a mile away and within view of the windows . and even that walk taxed his strength , he was an old man fallen upon decrepitude . and almost out of recognition , so that his gestures and the rare tones of his voice struck upon durrance as something painful .
they rather formed a rich unexplored shadow , which threw her tones into relief . the shearers reclined against each other as at suppers in the early ages of the world . and so silent and absorbed were they that her breathing could almost be heard between the bars . and at the end of the ballad , when the last tone loitered on to an inexpressible close . there arose that buzz of pleasure which is the attar of applause .
at the end of half an hour a faint dust was seen in the expected quarter . and shortly after a travelling carriage , bringing one of the two judges on the western circuit . came up the hill and halted on the top , the judge changed carriages whilst a flourish was blown by the big cheeked trumpeters . and a procession being formed of the vehicles and javelin men . they all proceeded towards the town .
it required a longer time , however , than mrs. [female] was inclined to allow . to reconcile [female] to the novelty of mansfield park . and the separation from everybody she had been used to . her feelings were very acute , and too little understood to be properly attended to . nobody meant to be unkind , but nobody put themselves out of their way to secure her comfort .
and the cavalry , with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could scarcely move . trotted with much effort to the column presented to them . that is to say , to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold , frost bitten , and starving . and the column that had been presented to them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to do . not only did his contemporaries , carried away by their passions , talk in this way .
they drew away from the colliery region . over the curve of the hill , into the purer country of the other side . towards willey green , still the faint glamour of blackness persisted over the fields and the wooded hills . and seemed darkly to gleam in the air , it was a spring day . chill , with snatches of [male] .
one of the chief causes that make [male] the favorite residence of artists . their ideal home which they sigh for in advance . and are so loath to migrate from , after once breathing its enchanted air -- is , doubtless . that they there find themselves in force . and are numerous enough to create a congenial atmosphere , in every other clime they are isolated strangers .
he did not move , the eagerness , the desire . the long years of ceaseless struggle . the thirst for affection , the sob of awe at the moonlit glade . the love , -- all these flamed in his eyes and fixed his gaze in an unconscious ardor that had nothing to do with convention or timidity . one on either side of the spike marked old norway log of the trail they stood .
alas , said king [male] . where is that knight become ? it is shame to all those in the field so to let him escape away from you . but with gentleness and courtesy ye might have brought him unto me to the castle of maidens . then the noble king [male] went unto his [organization] and comforted them in the best wise that he could . and said : my fair fellows , be not dismayed , howbeit ye have lost the field this day .
in july , father began his annual agitation for a vacation . mr. [male] , of [male] and son 's standard shoe parlor . did not believe in vacations , he believed in staying home and saving money . so every year it was necessary for father to develop a cough . not much of a cough , merely a small , polite noise , like a mouse begging pardon of an irate bee .
the old man paused behind the rock and bushes that concealed the mouth of the underground passage . not a hundred feet below was the old trail ; he followed the little path with his eye until it vanished around the shoulder of dewey . along that way he had come into the hills . then lifting his eyes to the far away lines of darker blue . his mind looked over the ridge to the world that is on the other side .
there lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these words something indescribably fierce and frenzied . javert did not say , `` be quick about it , '' he said `` bequiabouit . '' no orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered . it was no longer a human word : it was a roar . he did not proceed according to his custom , he did not enter into the matter .
presently after , these two set forth and descended to the harbour , it was a considerable basin . lying among sand hills , and surrounded with patches of down . ancient ruinous lumber , and tumble down slums of the town . many decked ships and many open boats either lay there at anchor . or had been drawn up on the beach , a long duration of bad weather had driven them from the high seas into the shelter of the port .
victoria 's naïve admiration of the house and gardens delighted her host and hostess . she could not be too much astonished at its wonders to please them . and , both being thoroughbred , they liked her the better for saying frankly that she was unused to beautiful houses . `` you can not think what this is like after school in potterston and cheap boarding houses in [location] and [location] , '' she said , laughing when the others laughed , [female] was longing to see her in the lily garden .
i went out , if , as soon as i got into the passage , i could have transported mr. [male] and sir [male] to the uttermost ends of the earth by lifting one of my fingers . that finger would have been raised without an instant 's hesitation . for once my unhappy temper now stood my friend , i should have broken down altogether and burst into a violent fit of crying . if my tears had not been all burnt up in the heat of my anger . as it was , i dashed into mr. [male] 's room .
on one of those warm evenings in july of which mention has been made . the two ladies sat together at an open window , looking out on the quiet square . it was too hot for lighted lamps , for reading . or for work ; it might have appeared too hot even for conversation . mrs. [female] having long been speechless .
the vessel had been caught in a gale off heligoland . and had foundered , they had all striven to get into the yacht 's boat . but those who had succeeded in doing so had gone down , the master of the yacht had seen the two brothers perish . those who were saved had been picked up off the spars to which they had attached themselves . there was no doubt in the way of the new baronet .
inside the entrance they paused , and eve shivered involuntarily , `` how gray it is ! '' she said , faintly , `` and how cold , like a graveyard , '' loder turned to her . far one moment control seemed shaken ; his blood surged . his vision clouded ; the sense that life and love were still within his reach filled him overwhelmingly . he turned towards eve ; he half extended his hands .
`` no , it 's not from a tradesman , '' said mrs. clavering . but she said nothing further , and both husband and daughter perceived that it was not intended that they should ask further questions . [female] , as usual , had taken her brother his breakfast . and mrs. clavering did not go up to him till that ceremony had been completed and removed . indeed it was necessary that she should study [female] 's letter in her own room before she could speak to him about it .
a large fire was blazing in the wide grate at the end of the dining room . the blinds had been drawn up , there was no longer need that the house should be wrapped in darkness . the awful presence had departed ; and such light as there was in the gloomy october sky was free to enter the rooms . which the death of one quiet , unobtrusive creature had made for a time desolate . there was no sound in the room but the low voice of the two doctors talking of their late patient in undertones near the fireplace .
on the left , as the girls walked silently , the coal mine lifted its great mounds and its patterned head stocks . the [male] railway with the trucks at rest looked like a harbour just below . a large bay of railroad with anchored wagons . near the second level crossing , that went over many bright rails , was a farm belonging to the collieries . and a great round globe of iron .
there seems to have been a rage at one period for commissioning statues of [male] . so donatello and others just turned to and did what they liked most in the way of budding youth . stuck a [male] 's head at its feet . and called it [male] . verocchio is the exception , there are hills out there with vineyards among them which draw me into wishing to be away from towns altogether .
i can not call him off his trip to sit down and sympathise with me . i must pull through this business alone , he said , he was lying on the sofa . eating his moustache and wondering what the darkness of the night would be like . then came to his mind the memory of a quaint scene in the soudan . a soldier had been nearly hacked in two by a broad bladed arab spear .
this reply reassured the [location] , a woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him . he retired to his toilet , when he reappeared . [male] received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on [male] . but a more profound tenderness for [male] was now visibly impressed upon his face . [male] cast a glance at his feet .
his stockings were worsted , and darned even on his excellent calves , his shoes had strings where buckles should have been . and mere [male] heels -- and low heels at that . as you know , he could walk at a round pace with them . a preposterous , vulgar thing , there was nothing in him to give this poverty a romantical air . to be sure , he had admirable legs , but the rest was neither good nor bad .
this letter was sent by the hand of a sort of managing clerk . one jaggers , who was at the same time commissioned to tell [male] that he could . if he chose , obtain a situation in a house at liverpool . where his father 's interest was sufficient to secure him a clerkship at a very moderate salary . now it so happened that jaggers had always appeared to be the best friend young [male] ever had .
driving my fleet air craft at high speed directly behind the warriors i soon overtook them and without diminishing my speed i rammed the prow of my little flier between the shoulders of the nearest . the impact sufficient to have torn through inches of solid steel . hurled the fellow 's headless body into the air over the head of his thoat . where it fell sprawling upon the moss , the mounts of the other two warriors turned squealing in terror . and bolted in opposite directions , reducing my speed i circled and came to the ground at the feet of the astonished zodangan .
[male] , on his side , found quarters in winchester square . having a `` den '' there of which he was very fond and being familiar with deeper fears than that of a cold kitchen . he availed himself largely indeed of the resources of [male] 's hotel . beginning his day with an early visit to his fellow travellers . who had mr. [male] in person , in a large bulging white waistcoat .
accordingly he started for the castle , having first picked up his gun on the spot where it had fallen from the hands of mrs. [female] . [female] was as simple and unsuspicious a man as it would be easy to find . but he was no fool , he had moved about the world and on various occasions come in contact with cases of this sort . as most other men have done , he knew that when a woman . in a moment of distress , calls a man by his [female] name it is because she is in the habit of thinking of him and speaking to him by that name .
she rang her bell and asked if mr. [male] were gone out . finding that he was , she ordered the carriage . and began to dress for the drive ; then she went down , and walked about the large drawing room like an imprisoned dumb creature . not recognizing herself in the glass panels . not noting any object around her in the painted gilded prison , her husband would probably find out where she had been .
but this life was a dream of workaday . he only lived in the other , which was spent in an old orchard , grassy and overgrown . where the minutes seemed to lag for sheer love of the spot and the june winds made wild harping in the old spruces . here every evening he met [male] . in that old orchard they garnered hours of quiet happiness together .
and so , bidding sir [male] to abide there still , till it was known how he sped . king bagdemagus bore the red cross shield out of the monastery . took with him a squire , the which should bring tidings unto sir [male] how he sped . and rode away , two miles off they came into a fair valley afore a hermitage . and there they saw a goodly knight in white armour , horse and all .
not only to save all further trouble in the matter of the hurdle . but to override me altogether upon the difficult question of damming . and i knew quite well that [female] wife never came to help at the washing without declaring that it was a sin for a well looking woman like mother . with plenty to live on , and only three children , to keep all the farmers for miles around so unsettled in their minds about her . mother used to answer oh fie , [female] fry !
with this she went away ; and in due time there circulated through the parish an assertion that it was a mistake to suppose lady constantine had anything to do with swithincleeve or his star gazing schemes . she had merely allowed him to rent the tower of her for use as his observatory . and to put some temporary fixtures on it for that purpose . after this lady constantine lapsed into her former life of loneliness . and by these prompt measures the ghost of a rumour which had barely started into existence was speedily laid to rest .
[female] at once guessed that this must be the picture of [female] . for , although quite unlike [female] 's sensitive , spirited face in general , there was a subtle . unmistakable resemblance about brow and chin . the pictured face was a very handsome one , suggestive of velvety dark eyes and vivid colouring . but it was its expression rather than its beauty which fascinated [male] .
returning from one of these dark walks they reached a great gravel cliff immediately over the levels . where they stood still and listened , the water was now high in the streams . squirting through the weirs , and tinkling under culverts ; the smallest gullies were all full . there was no taking short cuts anywhere , and foot passengers were compelled to follow the permanent ways . from the whole extent of the invisible vale came a multitudinous intonation .
and then at last they began to speak of [female] in fotheringay and at that a maid came in to say that it was eight o'clock . and would his reverence come up , as a few had to travel home that night and to come again next day ... it was after nine o'clock before he came downstairs again . to find the gentlefolk alone in the little parlour that opened from the hall . it gave him a strange thrill of pleasure to see them there in the firelight .
`` the devil it was , '' it irritated me to remember that bates probably knew exactly the nature of my grandfather 's will . and the terms of it were not in the least creditable to me . sister theresa and her niece were doubtless calmly awaiting my failure to remain at glenarm house during the disciplinary year . —sister theresa , a protestant nun . and the niece who probably taught drawing in the school for her keep !
i wish you would talk over this matter with any clever medical man in your neighborhood . and let me hear the result , and so you are surprised . you say , how little influence english representations exercise over the determinations of foreign cabinets . i go farther , and confess no astonishment at all at the no influence ! my dear dragoon , have you not , some hundred and fifty times in this life .
for the second time that night [male] pressed his lips to his [male] 's candid forehead . and for the second time the embrace was of a brotherly or paternal character . rather than the rapturous proceeding which it would have been had sir [male] towers been the privileged performer . it was five minutes past nine when sir [male] came down stairs . followed by his valet , grave and gray haired like himself .
mary assured her that she would not be provoked , and of course asked no more questions about [female] scatcherd . nor did she think much more about it , it was not so however with her ladyship . who could not keep herself from reflecting that the old clergyman in the close at barchester certainly had but two sons . one of whom was now the doctor at greshamsbury , and the other of whom had perished so wretchedly at the gate of that farmyard . who then was the father of [female] thorne ?
then she walked out of the room with something of stateliness in her gait . as might become a girl who had had it in her power to be the future lady peterborough . but as soon as she reached the sacredness of her own chamber . she gave way to an agony of tears . it would , indeed , be much to be a lady peterborough , and she had .
the gentle , happy [female] complied willingly , and so thoroughly had the beautiful lady won the girl 's heart before they were long together . that [female] herself proposed that [female] should accompany lady [female] to allanbay . with pretty imperiousness she bore down lady [female] 's grateful scruples . and the result was , that the two started that same evening , travelled as fast as post horses could carry them . and arrived at allanbay before even lady [female] 's impatience could find the journey long .
and at such intervals when he could take his mind from [male] and his affairs . it afforded mr. [male] infinite delight to tap a certain letter in his breast pocket . that opened , might have revealed in bold characters , a great deal of gratitude for his kindness in inviting the writer on with [male] . which was gladly accepted and signed [male] , `` where 's [male] ? '' said mr. [male] . as he and [male] got out of the carryall into the bustle of the farmhouse delight over their return .
madame [location] seemed to consider this question also . there again : one can not tell , she told me she had had a spiritual summons , whatever that is , from dr , carver , i am afraid she 's going to marry dr . carver ... [female] , there 's always some one she wants to marry . but perhaps the people in [location] just got tired of her , i think she was with them as a sort of paid companion .
presently , -- but it seemed a long long time first , -- she heard the quick prompt sounds . which told of her father 's arrival , in he came . to the room as yet only lighted by the fitful blaze of the fire . mr. [male] came in rubbing his hands after his frosty ride . molly judged from the look in his eye that he had been fully informed of the present state of things at the hall by some one .
upon saying this he leaves the court , and the emperor summons those in whom he has most confidence . he requests their advice concerning this defiance upon his brother 's part . and wishes to learn if he can trust them to lend no support or help to his brother 's claim . thus he tries to test the loyalty of each ; but he finds not one who sides with him in the dispute . rather do they all bid him remember the war which eteocles undertook against his own brother polynices .
without reply , the knight hastily muffled the recluse 's head in the veil . and the latter began to ascend the staircase as one too much accustomed to the way to require the use of light . while at the same time he held the lamp to the scot . who followed him for many steps up the narrow ascent . at length they rested in a small vault of irregular form .
after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr. and mrs. suckling . the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn . no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present . in the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings coming had been united , such as the last accounts of mrs. [female] .
possibly , having given the invitation by way of proving that there was nothing to conceal . [male] hoped it would not be accepted ; but he was disappointed . before the caïd had reached the top of the hill . nevill had told his chauffeur to stop the motor . therefore the restless panting had long ago ceased , and when [male] looked doubtfully at the car .
for which cogent reason i kept [female] at a distance during supper . and when i went up to my own old little room , took as stately a leave of her as i could . in my murmuring soul , deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day . as often as i was restless in the night . and that was every quarter of an hour , i reflected what an unkindness .
she does not care for me a bit . it humiliated him and also increased his compassion for the girl who in this darkness of life . buffeted and despairing , had fallen into the grip of his stronger will , abandoning herself to his arms as on a night of shipwreck . [female] on her side with partial insight ( for women are never blind with the complete masculine blindness ) . looked on him with some pity ; and she felt pity for herself too .
[female] , and walked steadily to a chair by the open window . looking out upon the beautiful scene , her face caught the light that was on the higher ground . and she said softly , `` ' i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills . '' that 's our word , now , is not it , dad ? i can share it with you , now . then the shepherd told her , young [male] had been at the ranch with mr. [male] since early in the evening .
she sighed heavily when i answered that last question . and said no more , we arrived at the station , with hardly two minutes to spare . the gardener managed about the luggage , while i took the ticket . the whistle of the train was sounding when i joined her ladyship on the platform . she looked very strangely , and pressed her hand over her heart .
to this day i never fully understood why she thus risked her interest for the sake of [female] . what people said , of course i know well . the whole house -- pupils , teachers , servants included . affirmed that she was going to marry him , so they had settled it . difference of age seemed to make no obstacle in their eyes .
after that he said nothing further to her upon the subject . to [organization] he spoke no word of overt love . but on an autumn day , when mrs [male] was already convalescent . and the repetition of his professional visits had become unnecessary , he got her to walk with him through the half hidden shrubbery paths . and then told her things which he should never have told her .
`` never , '' she had exclaimed when cherry had suggested such a result , `` never ! '' and [female] had echoed the protestation , `` never , never , '' i will not say that she would have allowed her husband to remain in his business in order that she might thus exclude [female] from such promotion . but she could not bring herself to believe that [female] would be so fatuous . so ignorant of his own interests , so deluded , as to marry that girl from bragg 's end ! it is thus that the mrs. [female] of the world regard other women 's daughters when they have undergone any disappointment as to their own .
lest -- [male] took it up -- he should suddenly grab me and run ? oh , as he is not ready to run , he 's much less ready . naturally , to grab , i am -- you are so far right as that . on the counter , when i am not in the shop window . in and out of which i am thus conveniently , commercially whisked : the essence .
he did not speak much ; esther fancied that he was still thinking of them . when the afternoon waned , about four o'clock , he called [male] . he told him to sit in the light where he could see him . and he looked at his son with such wistful eyes . these farewells were very sad , and esther had to turn aside to hide her tears .
the question of [male] 's beer and [male] 's brewery was running high in [male] . and had gotten itself involved in the mouths of the people of [male] . not only with the loves and sorrows of poor [male] . but with the affairs of this election , we know how [male] had been driven to declare himself a stanch supporter of the jew . he had become very stanch , -- stanch beyond the promising of his own vote .
overflowing pitcher plants grew in irregular beds . on slender stems , lifting high their flat buds . but scattered in groups here and there , sometimes with massed similar colours , sometimes in clumps and variegated patches . stood the rare , early fringed orchis , some almost white , others pale lavender and again the deeper colour of the moccasins . while everywhere on stems , some a foot high , nodded the exquisite lavender and white showy orchis .
mrs buggins had brought home word from some tea party that the story had been discussed among her own friends . but miss mackenzie had regarded that as an accident , a lawyer 's clerk or two about chancery lane or carey street might by chance hear of the matter in the course of their daily work . that it should be so , and that such people talked of her affairs distressed her . but that had , she was sure , been all , now , however , in her new home she had learned that mr maguire 's efforts had become notorious . and that she and her history were public property .
so sir [male] ordered that a place be made for him . and fair hands went to the hall door . and sat down among boys and lads , and there he ate sadly . after meat sir [male] bade him come to his chamber . where he should have meat and drink enough , and so did sir gawaine .
by every word that he had said , and by every act that he had done . he had shown himself to be unmoved by that episode in their joint lives . which [female] 's other friends had regarded as so fatal , when she first rejected him . he would not take his rejection , when she told him that she intended to marry her [male] . he silently declined to believe that such marriage would ever take place .
but night was coming on , and geraint was weak from his wounds and loss of blood . and [male] was full of trouble for the pain her husband suffered . she prayed fervently that soon they might reach a town where she could obtain help for him . so , with many lingering kisses , he set her down upon the road . and saw her hide in the thickets , by now the gloom of evening had settled upon them .
having said thus much , the counsellor leaned back upon his chair , and shaded his calm white bearded eyes from the rays of our tallow candles . he was a man who liked to look , rather than to be looked at . but lorna came to me for aid ; and i went up to lorna and mother looked at both of us . then feeling that i must speak first , i took my [female] round the waist . and led her up to the counsellor ; while she tried to bear it bravely .
i climbed to his room and found it empty . very likely he was off condoling with his friend and fellow conspirator . the caretaker , and i fumed with rage and disappointment . i was thoroughly tired , as tired as on days when i had beaten my way through tropical jungles without food or water . but i wished , in my impotent anger against i knew not what agencies , to punish myself .
a second more , and they were all in the dining room , [male] and angus had barred the heavy door . and already hamish and rostafel were firing through the two round ventilating holes in the window shutters . there were two more such holes in the door , and [male] took one . angus the other , but the enemy had already sheltered on the other side of the barricade . which would now serve them as well as it had served the europeans .
it was too dark to see anything distinctly , but , in the instant before it turned and fled . she caught sight of a shadowy male figure . and knew that her worst fears had been realised , the figure was too tall to be [female] . and [female] , she knew , was the only man in the house . male figures , therefore , that went flitting about windles , must be the figures of burglars .
for [male] , already puffed up with the great event which had taken place in his provincial life . he ate nothing whatever . madame alone , like a true lorrainer , kept pace with his majesty . so that [male] , who , without this partner , might have eaten nearly alone . was at first much pleased with his aunt , and afterwards with [female] saint remy .
as for money , she knew that she must have some to go on with until she could begin to earn . so far she had been forced to let knight pay her way , as he said . out of the `` good '' fund , her coming with him had been for his sake . and to spare him from gossip , for herself . she was in no mood to care what people said .
the only thing was that when she spoke hard she likewise did not look soft . something , none the less , had arisen in her now -- a full appreciable tide . entering by the rupture of some bar , she announced that if what she had asked was to prove in the least a bore her young friend was not to dream of it . making her young friend at the same time , by the change in her tone . dream on the spot more profusely , she spoke with a belated light .
his love for this place went through his whole life . and was with him until his death , he takes `` mr . [male] '' and his friends from [male] to cobham by the beautiful back road . and i remember one day when we were driving that way he showed me the exact spot where `` mr . [male] '' called out : `` whoa , i have dropped my whip ! ''
lady macleod was a woman of much patience . and possessed also of considerable perseverance , for another half hour she went on expatiating on the advantages which would accrue to [female] as a married woman from an acquaintance with her noble relatives . and endeavouring to persuade her that no better opportunity than the present would present itself . there would be a place in lady midlothian 's carriage . as none other of the daughters were going but lady [female] .
while the loves and graces have been preparing this torch for hymen . which is to be kindled tomorrow , mr [male] has suffered much in his mind . it would seem that both the mature young lady and the mature young gentleman must indubitably be [male] 's oldest friends . wards of his , perhaps ? yet that can scarcely be , for they are older than himself . [male] has been in their confidence throughout , and has done much to lure them to the altar .
he had more than his share of the blessed capacity of living again in the young . they were to him his future life . all of a future life that his fundamental pagan sanity perhaps admitted , there she was with everything before her . and his blood -- some of it -- in her tiny veins . there she was , his little companion , to be made as happy as ever he could make her .
starting to mount , the man stopped with one foot in the stirrup and raised his eyes towards her so suddenly that she shrank back again with a quicker throbbing at her heart and pressed closer to the earth . still , seen or not seen , flight was easy for her , so she could not forbear to look again . apparently , he had seen nothing -- only that the next turn of the trail was too steep to ride . and so he started walking again , and his walk , as he strode along the path . was new to her , as was the erect way with which he held his head and his shoulders .
but they worked on a small scale and with an eye to the immediate present only . bending their efforts to as large a cut as possible each season rather than to the acquisition of holdings for future operations . this they accomplished naively by purchasing one forty and cutting a dozen . [male] 's map showed often near the forks of an important stream a section whose coloring indicated private possession . legally the owners had the right only to the pine included in the marked sections .
he was highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army . but at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be . and he was always in a hurry to get where he was not . when on the twenty first of october his general expressed a wish to send somebody to denisov 's detachment . [male] begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse , but when dispatching him he recalled [male] 's mad action at the battle of vyazma .
a word , and forth they came to crowd upon the steps . but leaving clear the topmost step and a half moon space in the middle . to the spot so indicated , andre louis now advanced very deliberately , he took his stand there . dominating the entire assembly , he removed his hat . and launched the opening bombshell of that address which is historic .
as for the memory of rodolphe , she had thrust it back to the bottom of her heart . and it remained there more solemn and more motionless than a king 's mummy in a catacomb . an exhalation escaped from this embalmed love , that , penetrating through everything . perfumed with tenderness the immaculate atmosphere in which she longed to live . when she knelt on her gothic prie dieu .
i declare i hardly knew him again . he was so outrageously and unnaturally young , the utmost stretch of my influence was exerted over him in vain . he embraced me with the most touching fervour . he expressed the noblest sentiments -- but in the matter of his contemplated marriage . he was immovable , life was only tolerable to him on one condition .
indeed it was mr. [male] 's one aim during his stay at san salvatore to be a treasure . at all costs the three ladies who were not his wife must like him and trust him . then presently when trouble arose in their lives -- and in what lives did not trouble sooner or later arise ? they would recollect how reliable he was and how sympathetic , and turn to him for advice . ladies with something on their minds were exactly what he wanted .
the heightening colour spread to her forehead and her neck . and the nervous fingers suddenly clasped themselves fast round the edge of the book . she paused again , the colour that had spread over her cheeks suddenly . as suddenly left them , the hand on the album resigned its hold . trembled a little , and moved the book away from her , she looked at me for an instant .
all three ladies remonstrated , mr. [male] ought not to be hurried away without being allowed to accept another cup of tea . miss [female] had abundance of good tea in the pot . why was [male] in such haste to take a visitor to his den ? there was nothing but pickled vermin , and drawers full of blue bottles and moths . with no carpet on the floor , mr. [male] must excuse it .
but no husband came , the fact was that [male] had been much mistaken about the condition of [male] . people do not fall headlong on stumps of underwood with impunity . had the old man been able to watch [male] narrowly enough , he would have observed that on rising and walking into the thicket he dropped blood as he went . that he had not proceeded fifty yards before he showed signs of being dizzy . and , raising his hands to his head , reeled and fell down , [male] was not the only one who watched and meditated in hintock that night .
and [female] , seated near the window , distractedly looked out of doors , and dreamed . generally speaking , he mingled in these juvenile assaults with passion . but today it seemed to him a humming of idle words which he listened to from so far away . oh , so far away , in a bored and mocking demi torpidity , plunged in their discussions . the others were a long while in remarking his muteness .
now i have not judged it in any way needful or even becoming and delicate . to enter into my wrestling adventures , or describe my progress . the whole thing is so different from lorna , and her gentle manners . and her style of walking ; moreover i must seem to magnify myself so much . or at least attempt to do it , that i have scratched out written pages .
she was covered , except as to her face and part of her arms . with [female] lace hanging loosely from the summit of her whitening hair to the long train stretching from her tall figure . her arms , naked to the elbow , except for some rich bracelets . were folded before her , and the fine poise of her head made it look handsomer than it really was . but [male] felt no interval of observation before he was close in front of her .
`` if he did get it i think he was very clever . '' it was well known at this time to mrs. roby that the lopez marriage had been a failure . that lopez was not a rich man , and that [male] . as well as her father , was discontented and unhappy , she had latterly heard of the guatemala scheme . and had of course expressed her horror , but she sympathised with lopez rather than with his wife .
women favoured him , and men made themselves his boon companions . his wit was repeated ; the fashion of his hair and the cut of his waistcoat copied . he was at first rich and gay enough to be courted and made a favourite . but when his fortune was squandered , and his marriage with the heiress came to naught . those qualities which were vicious and base in him were more easy to be seen .
they were both good players , and the game lasted long . but ever and anon , while waiting for [male] to move , [male] glanced towards the spot where sir [male] stood . engaged in conversation with [male] and [male] . if the rector himself had known no blot on the character of [male] . the gipsy 's words would not have had a feather 's weight with him .
the matter remained in suspense for several days . the white jade concubine was the next lady commanded to the dragon chamber . and again the lady [female] was in her post of observation . much she heard , much she saw that was not to the point . but the scene ended as before by the dismissal of the lady in tears .
[female] was alternately diverted and pained ; but marianne persevered , and saw every night in the brightness of the fire . and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere . the certain symptoms of approaching frost , the miss dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with mrs. [female] 's style of living . and set of acquaintance , than with her behaviour to themselves . which was invariably kind , every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan .
but [female] was not satisfied , he was restless all that night . sounds which had been familiar now held a new significance for him , the next day he was filled with a quiet but brooding expectancy . he resented the intrusion of the strange footprints . it was , in his process of instinctive reasoning . an encroachment upon the property rights of his master .
not so gaily , however , but that tears filled her eyes as he went away down the dark street . not so gaily , but that she several times said , ah , poor little [female] ! ah , poor dear struggling shabby little [female] ! before she took heart to knock at the door . not so gaily , but that the brilliant furniture seemed to stare her out of countenance as if it insisted on being compared with the dingy furniture at home .
i looked into the room where i had left her . and i saw her seated in the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire . with her back towards me , in the moment when i was withdrawing my head to go quietly away . i saw a great flaming light spring up . in the same moment i saw her running at me .
and then , after a few soft , impromptu chords ; the theme changed , [male] 's heart stood still . [male] was playing `` the rosary , '' he did not sing it . but the soft insistence of the organ pipes seemed to press the words into the air . as no voice could have done , memory 's pearls . in all the purity of their gleaming preciousness .
they were very cautious , these night people . for unlike the creatures of the dawn , waking to greet the sun with song and happiness . most of them were sharp fanged and long clawed rovers and pirates of the great wilderness . ready to kill , and this , too , [male] sensed through the generations of northland dog that was in him . he heard a wolf howl .
the whole household , as if to atone for not having done it sooner , set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts . the wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts . the news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses . from which wounded men began to come into the rostovs yard , many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things . but the work of unloading , once started , could not be arrested , it seemed not to matter whether all or only half the things were left behind .
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched . and already had mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping . when an answer arrived which deferred it all , mr. [male] was obliged to be in town the following day . and , consequently , unable to accept the honour of their invitation , etc , mrs. bennet was quite disconcerted . she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire .
we had but to cross the road from our dwelling to the concert room . as we entered the corridor two ladies also stepped into it from a very grand carriage . they were accompanied by a young man , who stood a little to one side to let them pass . and as they came up and we came up , [male] francius came up too . one of the ladies was may [female] , who was dressed in [female] .
dicky stared at me for a moment , his face dark and distorted with passion . then , springing to his feet , he picked up his collar and tie and went into his room . returning with fresh ones , he snatched his hat and stick and rushed to the door . as he slammed it after him i heard another oath . one this time coupled with a reference to me .
thus does necessity play games with the best of us , even with [female] jarman . who , poor fellow , could not cross the straits of [male] without the most acute bodily suffering . the duc armand [male] choleaux lasuer opened one eye and then the other . then he shut them quickly and called for his valet [male] chambre . whom he cursed roundly for not seeing that there was a gap between the silken curtains of his bedroom window .
that is nothing , chief ; i can arrange with him who sits at ulundi . it is with you who are great here that i wish to come to terms . listen : if you grant my desire . not only will i fulfil yours upon your foes . but when the girl is delivered into my hands i will give you this rifle and a hundred rounds of cartridges .
there was a ball at the palace that night . stanief never danced , but every one else did , and the emperor opened the evening with the princess . it was obvious to all why stanief had been forced to this marriage . whenever adrian was seen with iría ; the boy so evidently liked . indeed , loved her , and the fifteen year old autocrat was always popularly supposed to be without affection .
on the shattered brain of the poor man this news had a terrible effect . he saw at once that his flight would be looked upon as a sign of his guilt . and he racked his brain for the name of some country where the laws of extradition were lax . the argentine rose to his mind , but he had no idea of going so far from england unless it were absolutely necessary . he preferred somewhere where the living would be more or less civilized and where he could be handy for return when circumstances permitted .
at this point many , indeed most , women , having had a tiring journey . would have gone to bed : but the familiar hampshire air and the knowledge that half an hour 's walking would take her to her beloved home acted on mrs. [female] like a restorative . one glimpse of windles she felt that she must have before she retired for the night . if only to assure herself that it was still there , she had a cup of coffee and a sandwich brought to her by the night porter . whom she had roused from sleep , for bedtime is early in windlehurst .
she gathered together stray garments that were hanging on the backs of chairs . and put each where it belonged in closet or bureau drawer . she changed her gown for a more comfortable and commodious wrapper . she rearranged her hair . combing and brushing it with unusual energy , then she went in and assisted the quadroon in getting the boys to bed .
he recoiled , being a man of position and importance . quick , fearless , and vindictive of temperament . and also , it would seem , extremely fortunate -- it had never happened to him in all his life to be so uncompromisingly and frankly judged . she was by no means the first to account him a fool . but she was certainly the first to call him one to his face .
yet at this moment she was scarcely disposed to think much about her father 's ill conduct . she considered only that he was her father . and that they had found each other after long years of separation . she stretched out her arms , and would have fallen upon his breast . but something in his manner repelled her .
thord pushed aside the hide curtain and went in . with stark at his heels , the dim daylight did not penetrate the interior . cressets burned , giving off a flickering brilliance and a smell of strong oil . the floor of packed snow was carpeted with furs , much worn . otherwise there was no adornment , and no furniture but a chair and a table .
the little quiver was in rose 's voice again as she ended . and [female] gave a quick sigh as he looked at the downcast face so full of the perplexity ingenuous spirits feel when doubt first mars their faith and dims the innocent beliefs still left from childhood . he had been expecting this and knew that what the girl just began to perceive and try modestly to tell had long ago been plain to worldlier eyes . the heiress was the attraction to most of the young men whom she met . good fellows enough , but educated , as nearly all are nowadays , to believe that girls with beauty or money are brought to market to sell or buy as the case may be .
9th. -- the first event of the morning was not of a kind to raise my spirits . a letter arrived for me from poor walter [male] . it is the answer to mine describing the manner in which sir [male] cleared himself of the suspicions raised by [male] letter . he writes shortly and bitterly about sir [male] 's explanations . only saying that he has no right to offer an opinion on the conduct of those who are above him .
some of the fishermen of [male] had been over on saturday . their season was a failure , and they were loud in their protests against the trawlers who were destroying the spawn . [male] had suggested a conference at his house on the following saturday of [male] men and [male] men . and recommended [male] as an advocate to advise with them as to the best means to put a stop to the enemies of the herring . [male] promised to be there , and then went home to auntie nan , he told himself on the way that [female] was completely above her surroundings .
but she found that mr grey was a man to whom she could not give much advice . it was he who did the speaking at this conference . and not she , she was overawed by him after the first three minutes . indeed her first glance at him had awed her , he was so handsome . and then , in his beauty , he had so quiet and almost saddened an air !
conjectures as to [female] 's awareness of the danger of extending his line . and as to luring the enemy into the depths of [location] . are evidently of that kind , and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to [male] and his marshals . or such plans to the russian commanders , all the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures . during the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the russian side to draw the french into the heart of the country .
that evening in park lane , watching his father dine . he was overwhelmed by his old longing for a son . a son , to watch him eat as he went down the years . to be taken on his knee as [male] on a time had been wont to take him . a son of his own begetting , who could understand him because he was the same flesh and blood .
she began to move towards the door , lord dawlish . anxious to follow , was detained by the fact that he had not yet paid the bill . the production and settling of this took time . and when finally he turned in search of claire she was nowhere visible . bounding upstairs on the swift feet of love .
the sight of the chartley woods . tall and splendid in the light of the setting sun . and already tinged here and there with the first marks of autumn , brought his indecision to a point . and he realized that he had no plan . he had heard that [male] occasionally rode abroad , and he hoped perhaps to get speech with her that way .
while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open . turned , and saw his father , instead of going direct to his study , [male] had returned to his bed chamber . which he was only this moment quitting , [male] uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son . of whose arrival he was ignorant , he remained motionless on the spot . pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat .
she saw no reason against their being happy , [female] had fine naval fervour to begin with . and they would soon grow more alike , he would gain cheerfulness . and she would learn to be an enthusiast for [male] and lord [male] . nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry . the idea of [female] musgrove turned into a person of literary taste .
such was the young man who now , in lieu of a profession . had taken upon himself the responsibility of an engagement with lady [male] . he was tolerably certain that , should he be able to overcome the parental obstacles which he would no doubt find in his path . money would be forthcoming sufficient for the purposes of matrimonial life . the duke 's wealth was fabulous , and as a great part of it .
`` now blessed be god , '' said sir [male] , then he asked his arms . mounted upon his horse , and , commending himself unto god . hung the white shield about his neck , so he departed . and within a while came by the hermitage , where the white knight awaited him . every each saluted other courteously , and the knight told sir [male] the marvels of the shield .
encouraged by the forbearing tenderness , the unfortunate one ventured to return to the house of his friend . the owner of the wood , hoping that , in spite of the sacrilege committed . he might be able to face a world that would be ignorant of his crime . as the vulpicide , on the afternoon of the day of the deed . went along the corridor to his room , one maid servant whispered to another .
he was right ; the two lighters held their course as far as nantes . watching each other , when the surintendant landed , [male] hoped he should be able to seek refuge at once . and have the relays prepared , but , at the landing , the second lighter joined the first . and [male] , approaching [male] , saluted him on the quay with marks of the profoundest respect . marks so significant , so public , that their result was the bringing of the whole population upon [male] fosse .
upon the egyptian darkness of [female] arundel 's life this girl arose as a star . and by and by all the horizon brightened under her influence . the soldier had been very little in the society of women . his mother , his sister [male] . his [male] olivia , and [female] 's gentle daughter were the only women whom he had ever known in the familiar freedom of domestic intercourse .
in front of the mill we found a considerable crowd . for the time being ripe , mr. [male] had made public the fact that he meant to work his looms by steam . the only way in which he could carry on the mill at all . the announcement had been received with great surprise and remarkable quietness . both by his own work people and all along enderley valley , still there was the usual amount of contemptuous scepticism .
the consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and is present in the heart of every russian . and a consciousness of this , and a foreboding that [location] would be taken . was present in russian [location] society in 1812 , those who had quitted [location] already in july and at the beginning of august showed that they expected this . those who went away , taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings . did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one 's children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits .
he came punctually , and i found cause to be thankful that i had adopted the precaution of calling him in . before midnight sir [male] 's strange temper broke out in the most violent and most alarming manner . and if the gardener had not been on the spot to pacify him on the instant . i am afraid to think what might have happened , the next day , or a day or two after . i forget which , the chaise was brought back from knowlesbury .
i constantly imagined , however , that forms were visible in all directions except that to which my gaze was turned . and that they only became invisible , or resolved themselves into other woodland shapes . the moment my looks were directed towards them . however this may have been , except for this feeling of presence , the woods seemed utterly bare of anything like human companionship . although my glance often fell on some object which i fancied to be a human form .
`` one of the servants , '' i ventured , and for a moment we stood irresolute . then we both turned rigid as some sound arose in one of the far-off rooms . only to quickly relax again as that sound resolved itself into a murmur of muffled voices . where there was talking there could be no danger of the special event we feared . our relief was so great we both smiled , next instant his face and .
meanwhile , the superintendent had taken a candle , and was examining the engravings that hung round the dining room . it was so common to him to be acquainted with crime . that he was far from feeling all his interest absorbed in the present case of violence . although he could not help having much anxiety to detect the murderer . he was busy looking at the only oil painting in the room ( a youth of eighteen or so .
it could not seem remarkable to [female] that a dinner guest should be announced to her sister beforehand . but , her eyes following the same direction as her uncle 's . she was struck with the peculiar effect of the announcement on [female] . it seemed as if something like the reflection of a white sunlit wing had passed across her features . ending in one of her rare blushes , for the first time it entered into [male] 's mind that there might be something more between mr. [male] and her sister than his delight in bookish talk and her delight in listening .
there was a scrubby growth of brush on the hillsides . and tall red willows along the streams , making a covert here and there for a horse . the fleeing man took advantage of every offering of this nature . as if he rode in constant fear of the bullet that he knew was his due . added to this cunning , he was well mounted , his horse being almost equal in speed to [male] .
this combination sounded so terrible to ranald that he surrendered at once ; and it was arranged that there should be a grand sugaring off . and that others besides the minister 's wife and her niece should be invited . but mrs. [female] had noticed the falling of ranald 's face at the mention of maimie 's visit to the camp . and feeling that she had taken him at a disadvantage . she determined that she would the very next day put herself right with him .
her mother told the good news , over which josie duly rejoiced . and demi received her congratulations with a benignant air which made her feel that too much satisfaction was not good for him . and incited her to put a thorn into his bed of roses at once . she got no further , for demi , red with wrath . made a rush at her , and the next moment a very agile young person was seen dodging round tables and chairs with the future partner of [organization] in hot pursuit .
no , stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water . i will go myself and [male] the lemonade . d'avrigny bounded towards the door . flew down the back staircase , and almost knocked down madame [male] villefort . in his haste , who was herself going down to the kitchen .
the three travellers had reached in silence the densest shades of the forest . it must have been a fair sight , under that green canopy of leaves . to see undine 's lovely form , as she sat on her noble and richly ornamented steed . with the venerable priest in the white garb of his order on one side of her . and on the other the blooming young knight in his gay and splendid attire .
she talked vaguely of being in [female] some time this autumn . and the vagueness continues , [female] , in consequence . roams round disconsolately with no interest but in hotel books . and for fear lest we should gird up his loins and drag him away with [male] out of paradisal possibilities . he is forever praising [male] as a resting place .
the daughter , make her give you the change . these things are only a penny a bunch , the mother . now tell me how you know that young gentleman 's name , the mother . i heard you call him by it . do not try to deceive me , an elderly gentleman of the amiable military type rushes into shelter .
three days later [male] left for the north . he was reluctant to go , when the time came , he attempted to kiss [female] good by . she caught sight of the rifle in its new leather and canvas case . and on a sudden impulse which she could not explain to herself , she turned away her face and ran into the house . [female] , vaguely hurt , a little resentful , as the genuinely misunderstood are apt to be .
a minute later she was standing by her old home . hers no longer , and haunted in her mind by many bitter memories , it was dark and cheerless . a candle had been burning in the parlour , but it was now spluttering in the fat at the socket . as she looked into the room , it blinked and went out . during the last mile of her journey she had made up her mind what she would do .
more and more as she talked the man wondered how this girl reared in the wilds had acquired a speech so free from grammatical errors . she was apparently deeply ignorant , and yet with a very few exceptions she made no serious errors in english . how was it to be accounted for ? he began to ply her with questions about herself . but could not find that she had ever come into contact with people who were educated . she had not even lived in any of the miserable little towns that flourish in the wildest of the west .
her ladyship asked me which was the head of the principal figure . and which the feet , and i must confess that i myself could not quite make out how [male] . had got his head between his knees , with the illustrated supplement to the third number . however , they were quite satisfied , it was [female] as queen [female] . by [organization] , a work of real artistic merit .
caudray glanced again at gilliatt , there are moments when mind and mind comprehend each other . caudray felt that there was some deception ; he had not the strength of purpose . perhaps he had not the idea of revealing it . whether in obedience to a latent heroism , of which he had begun to obtain a glimpse . or whether from a deadening of the conscience , arising from the suddenness of the happiness placed within his reach .
but could not help being frightened , and many women have blamed her , as i think unduly . for her mode of forsaking baby so , if it had been her own baby . instinct rather than reason might have had the day with her ; but the child being born of her [female] . she wished him good luck . and left him , as the fierce men came downstairs .
sinclair , turning on his heel , stalked in a dazed way toward the door . to cover this show of abruptness which was quite unusual on his part . i made the effort of my life . and , remarking lightly , `` she must have been here looking for the pin her friend has lost , '' i launched forth into an impromptu dissertation on one of the subjects i knew to be dear to the heart of the bookworm before me .
day after day the journey continued without rest . on the fourth day after leaving [location] it was [male] who brought in [male] 's supper . and he grunted a protest at his long hours of muscle breaking labor at the sweeps . when [male] questioned him he shrugged his shoulders . and his mouth closed tight as a clam , on the fifth .
[female] instantly ran down , the doctor was a friend of the family . and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day . and very fond of [male] , whose birth he had witnessed . he had himself a daughter about her age . but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive .
as they termed [female] , aunt [female] . in particular , soon had her own reason for disliking her . the second day after [female] 's arrival . as she was strolling through the yard , she encountered [female] . a bright little fellow , three years of age .
they came into the newly furnished drawing room , looking bright and fresh from their ride . osborne first , as usual , perfectly dressed for the occasion , and with the sort of fine manner which sate so well upon him . [male] , looking like a strong built , cheerful , intelligent country farmer . followed in his brother 's train , mrs. [female] was dressed for receiving callers . and made the effect she always intended to produce , of a very pretty woman .
it was a good idea , and caught at by the counsel for the defence . [male] gave just such testimony as was required to clear will from all suspicion . he had witnessed the pursuit , he had heard the conversation which took place between the boat and the ship . he had given will a homeward passage in his boat . and the character of an accredited pilot , appointed by the trinity house .
this we called the `` battle of the wilderness . '' victory over a nest of hornets we called the capture of `` fort sumter . '' a large nest of wasps gave [male] perhaps the hardest fight of our campaigning . this we ran across in the fields not far from home . there was an unusually large number of them , and as is usually the case with these insects .
but it is an awful thing , indeed , this endless endurance . this almost indestructibility , of a marble bust , whether in our own case . or that of other men , it bids [female] sadly measure the little . little time during which our lineaments are likely to be of interest to any human being . it is especially singular that americans should care about perpetuating themselves in this mode .
so the two days passed by and the time came at which [female] was to be there . as the minute hand on the drawing room clock came round to the full hour . she felt that her heart was beating with a violence which she could not repress . the thing seemed to her to assume bigger dimensions than it had hitherto done . she began to be aware that she was about to be guilty of a great iniquity .
so far [female] had spoken pretty much at random ; but it was now necessary . under the supervision of six eyes , to invent and tell some marvellous story . and , if it were possible , get back into his hands the all important signet . to squander time was the first necessity , the longer his stay lasted . the more would his captors drink , and the surer should he be when he attempted his escape .
he turned to go to sorelli 's dressing room , but met her on the way . with her little troop of trembling ballet girls , as we have seen , meanwhile , christine daae uttered a deep sigh . which was answered by a groan , she turned her head . saw [female] and started , she looked at the doctor . on whom she bestowed a smile , then at her maid .
the reason was this , from the moment when i had read mrs. [female] 's letter until now . a horrid doubt , which a priest was just the man to solve . had laid its leaden weight on my mind -- and , i firmly believe , on oscar 's mind as well . had time enough passed , since lucilla had left ramsgate . to allow of nugent 's marrying her , under his brother 's name ?
on the following morning he was smuggled out of barchester by an early train . and has never more been seen in that city , rumours of him . however , were soon heard , from which it appeared that he had made himself acquainted with the casual ward of more than one workhouse in [location] . his [male] left the inn almost immediately , -- as , indeed , he must have done had there been no question of mr. [male] 's cheque . and then there was nothing more heard of the stringers in barchester .
now he was offering it the chance . suddenly the six men below the jam scattered , four of them . holding their peaveys across their bodies , jumped lightly from one floating log to another in the zigzag to shore . when they stepped on a small log they re leaped immediately . leaving a swirl of foam where the little timber had sunk under them .
immediately they had gone , [female] , who had been waiting in the corridor . slipped back to her chair , first removing the tea tray from [female] table . soon she was busily taking down notes , while she was thus occupied . sir lyster was narrating to sir [male] the latest [male] dene outrage . first his open flouting of the chief naval constructor by refusing to see him .
i feel as if i could trust my happiness to carry me . as if it had grown out of me like wings . so she phrased it to darrow , as , later in the morning . they paced the garden paths together , his answering look gave her the same assurance of safety . the evening before he had seemed preoccupied , and the shadow of his mood had faintly encroached on the great golden orb of their blessedness .
only a few hours before i had heard a similar sound rising from the wainscoting of my own room in glenarm house . evidently the stone wall , too , was under suspicion ! tap , tap , tap ! the man with the hammer was examining the farther side of the gate . and very likely he would carry his investigations beyond it . i drew up my legs and crouched in the shadow of the pillar .
[male] , who is nearest to the doctor when he says this . grasps the doctor fervently by the hand , [male] , [male] . and [male] of the no surname , all shake hands with one another round . and with the doctor too , [male] blows his nose . and [male] of the no surname is moved to do likewise , but lacking a pocket handkerchief abandons that outlet for his emotion .
they had left the incessant passenger traffic of the north and west far and far behind them . here the people crawled to the side of the train . holding their little ones in their arms ; and a loaded truck would be left behind . the men and women clustering round it like ants by spilled honey . once in the twilight they saw on a dusty plain a regiment of little brown men .
several days had passed since her futile journey , and tess was afield . the dry winter wind still blew , but a screen of thatched hurdles erected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her . on the sheltered side was a turnip slicing machine , whose bright blue hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene . opposite its front was a long mound or `` grave '' . in which the roots had been preserved since early winter , tess was standing at the uncovered end .
she turned instinctively , feeling that even in this crisis there was some little service that she might render . but he did not see her , he went out . vouchsafing no further speech , she looked after him . and as his footsteps sounded on the stair she felt as if she were doomed and hearing her own death knell . what had she done ? what would he do now ? she stood there a dissonance of despair .
so [male] took his time , contented to behold the object of his affection two or three evenings a week . and to gaze admiringly upon her beauty as he smoked his pipe in the snug little oak wainscoted parlour at the grange . while his passion grew day by day . until it did really become a very absorbing feeling , second only to his love of money and wyncomb farm . these dull sluggish natures are capable of deeper passions than the world gives them credit for .
mr. [male] 's consultation of [male] seemed to have had the effect desired by mr. [male] . for early the next morning a letter came which [male] could carry to mr. [male] as the required testimony . the old gentleman was staying in bed on account of the cold weather . and as [male] was not to be seen in the sitting room , [male] went up stairs immediately and presented the letter to his uncle . who , propped up comfortably on a bed rest , was not less able than usual to enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating mankind .
in such towns in the south of england . [female] had seen the shopmen , when not employed in their business . lounging a little at their doors , enjoying the fresh air , and the look up and down the street . here , if they had any leisure from customers . they made themselves business in the shop .
i frowned and puzzled a little over this letter , be cautious ? in what possible way could i be cautious ? what need could there be for it when all that passed between me and [male] francius was the daily singing lesson at which he was so strict and severe . sometimes so sharp and cutting with me , i saw him then ; i saw him also at the constant proben to concerts whose season had already begun . proben to the `` passions musik , '' the `` messiah , '' etc . at one or two of these concerts i was to sing . i did not like the idea , but i could not make [male] francius see it as i did .
[female] had just been congratulating herself , in the midst of her perplexity . that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter . it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth . when her visitor entered , to force her upon this greatest exertion of all . her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance .
you are always like a toad under a harrow . and that without the slightest cause , i have money lying at hunky 's more than double enough for the bills . why can not you trust a man ? if you wo not trust me in saying so . you can go to mills happerton and ask him . but , remember , i shall be very much annoyed if you do so , -- and that such an inquiry can not but be injurious to me .
mr [male] descended with an air of resignation . and gave himself up , after taking friendly leave of mr [male] . once more , inspector and inspected went through the streets together , and so arrived at mr [male] 's door . but even there , when mr [male] had given his keeper good night . and had let himself in with his key , and had softly closed the door .
[male] became aware that his days were numbered -- phrase of unbelief . for are they not numbered from the beginning ? are our hairs numbered . and our days forgotten -- till death gives a hint to the doctor ? he was sorry for his past life . and thoroughly ashamed of much of it , saying in all honesty he would rather die than fall for one solitary week into the old ways .
`` i am going to her , '' and villefort , with his papers under his arm and hat in hand . directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife . at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp , pale brow . he then entered the room , madame [male] villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young [male] . by way of amusing himself , was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading them .
her warm lips clung to his , and her bare arms encircled his neck with the choking grip of a child 's . he looked ahead and braced himself on his feet . and after that he buried one of his hands in the soft mass of her hair and pressed her face against his naked breast . holding to the rail with one hand and clinging to [male] with his other arm . kent was gripped in the horror of what was happening , the [location] was slipping into the right hand channel !
it is some time since i made any reference to [female] pelet . the moonlight walk is , i think , the last incident recorded in this narrative where that gentleman cuts any conspicuous figure . the fact is , since that event , a change had come over the spirit of our intercourse . he , indeed , ignorant that the still hour . a cloudless moon , and an open lattice .
`` he is too beautiful for a man , '' she added . after such a scrutiny as she would have bestowed upon a rival , ah ! how sharply i felt at that moment those pangs of jealousy in which a poet had tried in vain to make me believe ! the jealousy of engravings , of pictures . of statues , wherein artists exaggerate human beauty . as a result of the doctrine which leads them to idealize everything .
after some mature deliberations , sandford was now preparing to go to lord elmwood at his house in town . and there , to deliver himself the news that must sooner or later be told . and he meant also to venture , at the same time . to keep the promise he had made to his dying lady . but the news reached his lordship before sandford arrived .
i doubt whether michel voss had ever realised the fact that september is the kindliest of all the months . but he felt it , and enjoyed the leisure of his sunday afternoon when he could get his niece to take a stretch with him on the mountain side . on these occasions madame voss was left at home with [male] le cure . who liked to linger over his little cup of coffee , madame voss . indeed , seldom cared to walk very far from the door of her own house .
the fellow , instead of approaching , merely stood and stared ; his eyes bulging and his jaw dropped . and then another savage face appeared , and a third and fourth and fifth , craning their necks over the shoulders of their fellows whom they could not pass upon the narrow ledge . each face was the picture of awe and fear . but for what reason i did not know , nor did i learn until ten years later . that there were still other braves behind those who regarded me was apparent from the fact that the leaders passed back whispered word to those behind them .
after tea miss [female] proposed a walk around the premises . in order to initiate me into my duties . apart from his farm , mr. [male] owned large grist and saw mills and did a flourishing business . with the details of which miss [female] so conversant that i lost all doubt of her ability to run the whole thing as she had claimed . i felt quite ignorant in the light of her superior knowledge .
but no such happy order had as yet been given ; and , as far as the family could foresee . [female] intended to pass the winter with them at courcy . the guests , as i have said , were all gone , and none but the family were in the house when her ladyship waited upon her lord one morning at twelve o'clock . a few days after mr [male] 's visit to the castle . he always breakfasted alone , and after breakfast found in a french novel and a cigar what solace those innocent recreations were still able to afford him .
and so it went , the most amazing running commentary on literature i had ever heard . i was hugely interested , and i quizzed him on sociology . yes , he was a red , and knew his kropotkin , but he was no anarchist . on the other hand , political action was a blind alley leading to reformism and quietism . political socialism had gone to pot , while industrial unionism was the logical culmination of marxism .
but , whether he had not noticed the trick , or did not dare to attempt it . the `` new fellow , '' was still holding his cap on his knees even after prayers were over . it was one of those head gears of composite order . in which we can find traces of the bearskin . shako , billycock hat .
mira , ay , madam ; but that is too late . my reward is intercepted , you have disposed of her who only could have made me a compensation for all my services . but be it as it may , i am resolved i will serve you . you shall not be wronged in this savage manner , lady , how ? dear mr. [male] , can you be so generous at last ? but it is not possible .
one day there came the new era of swadeshi in bengal . but as to how it happened , we had no distinct vision . there was no gradual slope connecting the past with the present , for that reason . i imagine , the new epoch came in like a flood . breaking down the dykes and sweeping all our prudence and fear before it .
what was there to keep him from accepting ? his wife 's affection was dead . if her sentimental fancy for him had ever deserved the name ! and his passing mastery over her was gone too -- he smiled to remember that . hardly two hours earlier , he had been fatuous enough to think he could still regain it ! now he said to himself that she would sooner desert a friend to please him than sacrifice a fraction of her income .
the mother feebly shook her head , as if such a spot could be found on earth . while she lived , but she saw that guy was right . to expect him to remain at home was cruelty . as he had said , he could not bear it , few could . few even among women -- of men much fewer , one great renunciation is possible .
the wind had died down , [male] was already busy over the cook fire . and in [male] 's tent he saw the light of a candle . she appeared a little later , wrapped close in a thick red [female] 's [female] . and with a marten skin cap on her head , something in her first appearance . the picturesqueness of her dress , the jauntiness of the little cap .
this quality in it seemed possibly a little to deny weight to maud [female] 's evoked presence . as [female] , still sitting up , became , in excited reflection , a trifle more conscious . something determinant , when the girl had left her . took place in her -- nameless but , as soon as she had given way , coercive . it was as if she knew again , in this fulness of time .
society would imagine him dead , while he was rich . they would believe him drowned , while he was saved . what a capital trick to have played off on the stupidity of the world , for example . the great trade in coffee from [location] was just beginning to be developed . there were heaps of gold to be made , he would see .
then sir gawaine , remembering his hatred of sir [male] . persuaded the king to make him ready another host . with which to invade the land of brittany where sir [male] ruled his kingdom . for a long time the king would not listen to his advice . and the queen , with all her power , strove against sir gawaine .
instead of telling what he meant , he raised his head suddenly . i made the same movement in the same instant . we both looked to one point -- the high tree shadowing the great berceau . and resting some of its boughs on the roof of the first classe . there had been a strange and inexplicable sound from that quarter , as if the arms of that tree had swayed of their own motion .
erec from lance 's length lays him over on the hard ground . while riding back he met the king of the red city . who was very valiant and bold , they grasp their reins by the knots and their shields by the inner straps . they both had fine arms , and strong swift horses . and good shields , fresh and new , with such fury they strike each other that both their lances fly in splinters .
`` all go away , except my mother , '' i said very quietly , but so that i would be obeyed . and everybody knew it , then mother came to me alone . and she said , the frost is in her brain . i have heard of this before , [female] . `` mother , i will have it out , ''
the constable who came with the hue and cry was immediately informed of this , and came over to me to be satisfied from my own mouth . and i assured him that i saw the three gentlemen as i was at the window . that i saw them afterwards at the windows of the room they dined in . that i saw them afterwards take horse . and i could assure him i knew one of them to be such a man .
in the days which followed lord [location] 's visit to [female] at the cottage . not a few of the occupants of belpher castle had their mettle sternly tested in this respect . and it is a pleasure to be able to record that not one of them failed to come through the ordeal with success . the general public , as represented by the uncles , cousins , and aunts who had descended on the place to help lord belpher celebrate his coming of age . had not a notion that turmoil lurked behind the smooth fronts of at least half a dozen of those whom they met in the course of the daily round .
but the whole party was eager for shore , and no sooner had the enchantress put her foot on the yellow sands than she was deserted by her passengers . the bazaars were the first attractions , for `` everybody said '' that they were as fine in their way as the bazaars of [location] . so very soon we were all buying silver . ivory , stuffed crocodiles and ostrich feathers from the sudan .
ere [male] had finished his meal , the ancient omrah . who had brought the soldan 's letter to the [male] camp . entered with a plan of the ceremonial to be observed on the succeeding day of combat . [male] , who knew the taste of his old acquaintance . invited him to pledge him in a flagon of wine of [male] .
[female] set her teeth , not entirely in the metaphorical sense . for her hand , obeying the impulse towards definite action . laid firmly upon the table beside her an envelope which she had been grasping all this time in complete forgetfulness . the address was uppermost , and a moment later she saw [male] 's eye rest upon it as he rose to fulfil some duty with a plate . his expression instantly changed , he did what he was on the point of doing .
the cry : audacity , is a fiat lux . it is necessary , for the sake of the forward march of the human race . that there should be proud lessons of courage permanently on the heights . daring deeds dazzle history and are one of man 's great sources of light . the dawn dares when it rises , to attempt , to brave , to persist .
an then when you get home without a bath or a hair cut or the movies or nothin . an you forgot to get that shavin soap for yourself an spent all your money they say thanks bill . put it over there , can you change a ten dollar bill ? there ought to be a law against makin money in such big numbers . im glad you taken up singin lessons again .
leo nodded , he had become very silent of late , and we started with nothing but the clothes we stood in . a compass , our revolvers and express rifles . and about two hundred rounds of ammunition , and so ended the history of our visit to the ancient ruins of mighty and imperial kor . as for the adventures that subsequently befell us , strange and varied as they were . i have , after deliberation , determined not to record them here .
martin [female] was a gentleman chiefly distinguished by good nature . hospitable instincts , and an enthusiastic devotion to agriculture . there were very few things in common between him and his brother in law the australian merchant . but they got on very well together for a short time , [male] pretended to be profoundly interested in the thrilling question of drainage . deep or superficial , and seemed to enter unreservedly into every discussion of the latest invention or improvement in agricultural machinery .
but she had jumped up too , you must find me first ! ', she cried . her lover followed her as she withdrew . it was now dark inside the room , and the window being small he could not discover for a long time what had become of her . till a laugh revealed her to have rushed up the stairs . whither jude rushed at her heels , it was some two months later in the year .
the igniting and releasing devices worked cleverly , i pulled two of the tripping lines . and two of the contraptions exploded into light and noise and at the same time ran automatically down the jigger trysail stays . and automatically fetched up at the ends of their lines , the illumination was instantaneous and gorgeous . [female] , the two sail makers , and the steward . at least three of them awakened from sound sleep , i am sure -- ran to join [female] along the break of the poop .
a deep fosse , or ditch , was drawn round the whole building . and filled with water from a neighbouring stream , a double stockade . or palisade , composed of pointed beams , which the adjacent forest supplied . defended the outer and inner bank of the trench . there was an entrance from the west through the outer stockade .
he died having done nothing -- not having even made a will , the son wisely provided for himself . he came to england at once , and took possession of the property . there was no one to suspect him , and no one to say him nay . his father and mother had always lived as man and wife . none of the few people who were acquainted with them ever supposed them to be anything else .
they were all highly delighted with her [male] , air , and beauty . and declared [male] to be a man of very little taste when he rejected such charms . but the one who admired her most was [male] . for it seemed to him that in all the days of his life he had never seen such a lovely creature . and he asked the curate with great eagerness who this beautiful lady was .
it did occur to him to summon the guard . but [male] might avail himself of that moment to effect his escape . so he remained , grasped his cane by the small end . and leaned against the door post , without removing his eyes from [male] . what did he say to her ? what could this man , who was reproved .
a moment later [male] knew that it was adare who had passed his door . he dressed and shaved himself before he left his room . he found adare in his study . metoosin already had a fire burning . and adare was standing before this alone , when [male] entered .
[male] went with them , of course . and sat on one of the broad stone battlements looking out at the still night . with his profile defined as sharply as a cameo against the deepening blue of the sky . he was very silent , and his silence had a distracting influence on [male] . who made vain efforts to understand what mr. [female] was saying to her .
you may well warn me against such an evil . no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame . the impression will pass away soon enough , i did not persuade them ; i have not the means . it is all your uncle 's doing , he has managed to buy wickham for us . no , papa , my aunt gardiner has written me that you are to give [female] an allowance .
birkin smiled to himself as he sat by the fire . when ursula came down he sat motionless . with his arms on his knees , she saw him . how he was motionless and ageless . like some crouching idol , some image of a deathly religion .
emma , on the other hand , knew how to look after her house . she sent the patients accounts in well phrased letters that had no suggestion of a bill . when they had a neighbour to dinner on sundays . she managed to have some tasty dish -- piled up pyramids of greengages on vine leaves . served up preserves turned out into plates -- and even spoke of buying finger glasses for dessert .
[male] was standing by the door of the library . pale as death -- more ghastly of aspect than death itself . he had been leaning against the doorway , as if unable to support himself . but , as [male] approached , he aroused himself from a kind of stupor . and stretched out his arm to bar her entrance to the death chamber .
`` what is this all about ? '' then demanded he of the assembly , with the majestic tone of [male] pronouncing the quos ego . at the very instant , at the first sound of his voice , to carry on the virgilian metaphor . [male] 's recruits , recognizing each his sovereign lord . discontinued their plank fighting and trestle blows , on their side . the sailors , seeing that long naked sword , that martial air .
they chatted on for some time , [female] being set quite at her ease by her entertainer . mrs. [female] was far too well practised a woman not to know that to show a marked patronage to a sensitive young girl who would probably be very quick to discern it . was to demolish her dignity rather than to establish it in that young girl 's eyes . so , being violently possessed with her idea of making use of this gentle acquaintance . ready and waiting at her own door , she took great pains to win her confidence at starting .
it seems to be my fate to be always misunderstood . my sudden flight from the rectory meant no disrespect to my father . i left as i did , because i was quite incapable of facing the woman whom i had once dearly loved . thinking of her as i think now , it is so unendurable to feel that your confidence is lost in a person whom you once trusted without limit . and to go on meeting that person every hour in the day with a smooth face .
he came into this country like a mad man . with dogs and boys chasing him . and by miracle he was brought into his wit again . if ye list to come into the castle , ye must ride unto the farther side of the isle . and there ye shall find a vessel that will bear you and your horse .
how can he make the fox break ? ', said vavasor . and as his voice was by no means encouraging grindley rode away . lunch and cigars lasted till two , during which hour the hounds . the huntsmen , the whips , and old sir [male] were hard at work . as also were some few others who persistently followed every chance of the game .
rushbrook was in the library at the same time . he shewed her several beautiful prints which lord elmwood had just received from [location] . and appeared anxious to entertain and give tokens of his esteem and respect for her . but what gave her pleasure beyond any other attention . was , that after she had taken about a dozen volumes from different shelves .
whereupon lady [female] confessed that she did know the gazebees . mr gazebee , she said . was a man who in early life had wanted many advantages . but still he was a very estimable person , he was now in parliament . and she understood that he was making himself useful .
then [male] told him of the failure of his mission . told him plainly and fully but tenderly , softening the hard sayings but revealing the whole truth . as he did so he was conscious that he was not feeling like one who brings bad news . he knew that his mouth in the darkness was screwed up into an ugly smile . and , do what he would ; he could not make it straight and sorrowful .
she walked bent forward , with drooping head , like an old woman . the weight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms . the iron handle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands . she was forced to halt from time to time . and each time that she did so , the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs .
being alone , [male] found himself leaning against the mantelpiece and looking across at his father 's picture . he began to contrast his father with himself . he was a success , his father had been a failure . at seven and twenty he was deemster at all events . at thirty his father had died a broken man , he had got what he had worked for .
not long after , perhaps a fortnight , i saw three persons . count [male] , his daughter . and [female] , sitting on one seat , under a low spreading and umbrageous tree . in the grounds of the palace at bois l'etang . they had come thither to enjoy a summer evening .
however these things may have been , it is certain that he had emigrated to natal under a cloud . and equally certain that his relatives at home were content to take no further interest in his fortunes . during the fifteen or sixteen years which he had spent in or about the colony . hadden followed many trades , and did no good at any of them . a clever man , of agreeable and prepossessing manner .
why , she was a perfect ass ; and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if she had been a leaf out of the gospel . it kind of sizes up the whole party . and think of the simple ways of this court . this wandering wench had not any more trouble to get access to the king in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse in my day and country . in fact , he was glad to see her .
on entering the small anteroom which was called a dressing room , but which [male] really used only to lounge and write in . he just cast his eyes on the writing table , and saw that there were several letters and packets lying there . but he was in the uncomfortable dusty condition of a man who has had a long hurried journey . and he must really refresh himself by attending to his toilette a little . before he read his letters , [organization] was there .
she raised her head . and , looking at him , told him she was ready . as she stood , and looked upon him going away , her face was so like marion 's as it had been in her later days at home . that it was wonderful to see , he took the child with him . she called her back - she bore the lost girl 's name -
at length her father presented him . and she perceived , with a sigh of regret . that he was not the youth she had observed from the window . he advanced with a very engaging air , and she met him with an unfeigned welcome . his figure was tall and majestic ; he had a very noble and spirited carriage .
not his ascendancy alone , however , held me in thrall at present . of late it had been easy enough for me to look sad : a cankering evil sat at my heart and drained my happiness at its source . the evil of suspense , perhaps you think i had forgotten mr. [male] . reader , amidst these changes of place and fortune . not for a moment , his idea was still with me .
she had come here in an exploring mood sometimes when she was quite a child . but she never remembered the room having been put to any use . and as she had grown older it had come to have a haunted air . and she had touched the inanimate things with a sense of awe . wondering what her mother 's life had been like in that room .
`` take me to them , '' cried beaumains . and the poor squire , holding the knight 's stirrup leather . ran with him , and surely , in a little while . three knaves rushed forth before them in the green drive and bade beaumains stand . but grimly he dashed at them , before ever they could recover .
the difficulty was to provide marguerite with a pair of shoes . and great was the little middy 's joy when my lady found that she could put foot on english shore in his best pair . the rest is silence , -- silence and joy for those who had endured so much suffering . yet found at last a great and lasting happiness , but it is on record that at the brilliant wedding of sir [male] . bart. , with mlle , [male] basserive .
the singular coincidence of the meeting between miss [female] and her rejected lover . captain bramble , under such singular circumstances , led him once more to press this suit . and now , as she regarded him largely in the light of a protector . the widow quite approved of his intimacy , and indeed , as far as propriety would permit . seconded his suit with her daughter , when in [location] .
he arose and went away , leaving his audience not much elated with the hope of long life . the prince consoled himself with remarking that it was not reasonable to be disappointed by this account . for age had never been considered as the season of felicity . and if it was possible to be easy in decline and weakness . it was likely that the days of vigour and alacrity might be happy .
with spears in rest , seven of the knights thundered against sir perceval . but by this time sir [male] was upon his horse . and , making no outcry , he spurred upon the others . three knights he dashed to the ground with one lance thrust . but then the spear broke , therewith he drew his sword .
to open the door was like slicing into a wedding cake ; then , -- where was i to put a foot into that new laid carpet of ankle deepness ? i hobbled out in a pair of my uncle 's . i suppose it is because i know every tree and shrub in its true form that snow seems to pile itself nowhere as it does here . it becomes a garden of entombments . now and then some heap would shuffle feebly under its shroud , but resurrection was not to be .
he was forced to acknowledge to himself that he could not complete the work of staunching the hold . he had scarcely eaten anything , and he had the humiliation of feeling himself exhausted . he measured the progress of his work by the sinking of the level of water below his knees . the fall was slow , moreover , the leakage was only interrupted . the evil was moderated , not repaired , the tarpaulin pushed into the gap began to bulge inside .
madame bovary senior , the evening before , passing along the passage . had surprised her in company of a man -- a man with a brown collar . about forty years old , who , at the sound of her step . had quickly escaped through the kitchen , then emma began to laugh , but the good lady grew angry . declaring that unless morals were to be laughed at one ought to look after those of one 's servants .
but who shall tell of annie 's grief ? the poor little thing would have staked her life upon finding the trinket . in all its beauty , lying under the pannikin , she proudly challenged me to lift it . which i had done , long ere that , of course -- if only i would take the risk of the spell for my incredulity . i told her not to talk of spells , until she could spell a word backwards . and then to look into the pan where the charmed cream should be , she would not acknowledge that the cream was the same as all the rest was .
i did not know that the musicians before me were nearly all true artists . and some of them undoubted gentlemen to boot . even if their income averaged something under that of a skilled lancashire operative . but even if i had known it as well as possible , and had been aware that there could be nothing derogatory in my knowing or being known by one of them . i could not have been more wretched than i was in having been , as it were .
silently he admired himself , how conveniently well he looked . and how well a dinner coat became him . he stepped into the hall and then waited at the top of the stairs . for he heard footsteps coming , it was [female] . and from the top of her shining hair to her little golden slippers she had never seemed so beautiful , [male] !
all the out of doors men would have said the same ; mr [male] wished a tree cut down . or kept standing , or had such and such a fancy about the game . or had desired something unusual about the horses ; and they had all to attend to it as if it were law . but today the burgundy with the yellow seal was to be brought . and it was brought , molly testified with quiet vehemence of action .
fourthly , it was announced , that , on the second day , there should be a general tournament . in which all the knights present , who were desirous to win praise , might take part . and being divided into two bands of equal numbers , might fight it out manfully . until the signal was given by prince [male] to cease the combat . the elected queen of love and beauty was then to crown the knight whom the prince should adjudge to have borne himself best in this second day .
therefore if you wanted lorna ( as i was always sure to do . god knows how many times a day ) , the very surest place to find her was our own old kitchen . not gossiping , i mean , nor loitering , neither seeking into things , but seeming to be quite at home . as if she had known it from a child . and seeming to light it up , and make life and colour out of all the dullness .
he had learned mrs. [female] 's address . and the name of trotter 's buildings . which details were to his mind circumstantial . corroborative , and damnatory , some dim account of the battle at the three honest men had reached him . and the undoubted fact that carry brattle was maintained by the vicar .
though nobody had expressed to [female] at stratton any fear of [female] clavering 's perfidy . that young lady was not altogether easy in her mind , weeks and weeks had passed . and she had not heard from him , her mother was manifestly uneasy . and had announced some days before [female] 's departure . her surprise and annoyance in not having heard from her eldest son .
the iris of the eyes is blood red . as in albinos , while the pupil is dark , the eyeball itself is very white . as are the teeth , these latter add a most ferocious appearance to an otherwise fearsome and terrible countenance . as the lower tusks curve upward to sharp points which end about where the eyes of earthly human beings are located . the whiteness of the teeth is not that of ivory .
that was the day ... and the night for another story . pale as a dream and shadowed with pencilled trees . ghosts of the stars came by who had sought for glory . whispered to [male] of [male] in the plaintive breeze . whispered of old dead faiths that the day had shattered , youth the penny that bought delight of the moon .
mr. [male] would be too conscientious to regard his own side on such an occasion as this . but mark [male] would be sure to support his friends and oppose his enemies . let the case be what it might , now , gentlemen , if you please . we will go into the other room , said [male] . they went into the other room , and there they found five chairs arranged for them round the table .
it surprised him that life should be going on in the old way when his own reactions to it had so completely changed . it was newport that had first brought home to him the extent of the change . in [location] , during the previous winter , after he and may had settled down in the new greenish-yellow house with the bow window and the pompeian vestibule . he had dropped back with relief into the old routine of the office . and the renewal of this daily activity had served as a link with his former self .
black spanish locks , a sunburnt cheek a brow high . broad , and white , where every furrow seems to speak of mind and moral might . is that her god ? i can not tell ; her eye a moment met th'impending picture . then it fell darkened and dimmed and wet , a moment more , her task is done . and sealed the letter lies ; and now , towards the setting sun she turns her tearful eyes .
the present was the christmas quarter , and she was richer by five and twenty shillings than she had been before . mrs. [female] had given her ten shillings . mr. [male] five , and the other ten had been contributed by the four young ladies . out of this money she hoped to be able to buy a dress and a pair of boots . as well as a fortnight 's rest with mrs. [female] .
the combination of the two lacks elevates the husband and father into an autocrat . [female] was not one her world would have counted weak ; she had physical courage enough . she rode well , and without fear ; she sat calm in the dentist 's chair . she would have fought with knife and pistol against violence to the death . and yet , rather than encounter the brutality of an evil begotten race concentrated in her father .
[female] , repeated [female] , turning to [male] with a pained . depressed look on his face , `` it sounds like something you blow in to make a noise . '' the barber 's customer was a taller man standing than he was long lying . there was not much clearance between his head and the ceiling of the porch . he stood before [male] glowing .
`` i do not doubt you any longer , '' said [female] . putting out her hand ; a vague fear for him impelling her unutterable affection . he took her hand and raised it to his lips with something like a sob . but he stood with his hat and gloves in the other hand . and might have done for the portrait of a royalist , still it was difficult to loose the hand .
in the course of a few hours she returned home . bearing the sad tidings , which was received by her mother with a burst of tears . but [female] preserved the same indifference which had been manifested throughout all mr. [male] 's illness . hard hearted as she was , there came a time in after years when that proud head was bowed with grief . and those dark eyes were bedimmed by tears of penitence .
[female] no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which . in spite of all his attentions , he had previously excited . and what had been terror and dislike before , was now absolute aversion . yes , aversion , his cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her . she had often read of such characters , characters which mr. [male] had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn .
life in all its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified by this scene . as the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of altar boys . the smallest , an angelic youth of eleven , came first , bearing aloft a magnificent silver cross . in the hands of each subsequent pair of servitors was held a tall , lighted candle . the priest , in [female] cloth and lace .
[male] glanced at his wife , then they laughed together . [male] stepped over a snake fence , went carefully down a hill . crossed the meadow to the shade of a tree . sat on the bank of the brook and watched peaches as she studied first the clear babbling water . then the grass trailing in the stream .
though august had already given place to september , the weather was warm and balmy . as in the full glory of midsummer , sir [male] rode behind lady [male] 's barouche . too remote to hear the words that were spoken by those who occupied the vehicle . but quite near enough to distinguish the tones and the laughter , and to perceive every gesture . he saw [male] bend forward to address [male] .
i am attending gymnasium very regularly of late , a proctor system has been devised . and failure to comply with the rules causes a great deal of inconvenience . the gymnasium is equipped with a very beautiful swimming tank of cement and marble . the gift of a former graduate , my room mate , miss [female] . has given me her bathing suit ( it shrank so that she can no longer wear it ) .
she was there in good time , i see her gazing across the road at these walls which are . properly speaking , awful , you do indeed seem to feel along the very lines and angles of the unholy bulk . the fall of time , drop by drop . hour by hour , leaf by leaf . with a gentle and implacable slowness , and a voiceless melancholy comes over one .
two magnificent white bearskins lay between him and the end of the room . the walls were hung with pictures , and at the four windows were curtains of ivory lace draped with damask . the lamp which bateese had lighted was fastened to the wall close to him . it was of polished silver and threw a brilliant light softened by a shade of old gold . there were three other lamps like this , unlighted , the far end of the room was in deep shadow .
if little [female] were beyond measure perplexed by this curious conduct on the part of her new acquaintance . and by finding herself involved in this singular treaty . her perplexity was not diminished by ensuing circumstances , besides that mr [male] took every opportunity afforded him in mr [male] 's house of significantly glancing at her and snorting at her . which was not much , after what he had done already -- he began to pervade her daily life . she saw him in the street , constantly .
my lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side . she said in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the other cattle . a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely because it referred to them . and not because it insulted or offended them , for it did not . and yet they were not slaves , not chattels .
nothing was needed but this ; the wretched man , after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years . had risked his life to come to me , and i held it there in my keeping ! if i had loved him instead of abhorring him ; if i had been attracted to him by the strongest admiration and affection . instead of shrinking from him with the strongest repugnance ; it could have been no worse . on the contrary , it would have been better , for his preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart .
[female] began by seeming dull to me . but it improves and unfolds beautiful corners of itself to be looked at . only i am given so little time , the tombs of the della scalas and the [organization] façade of the consiglio are what chiefly delight me . i had some quiet hours in the museo , where i fell in love with a little picture by an unknown painter . of [male] charming the beasts in a wandering green landscape .
olivia [female] shared in none of the festivals that were held . her father was very ill this winter ; and she spent a good deal of her time at [organization] rectory . sitting in hubert arundel 's room , and reading to him . but her presence brought very little comfort to the sick man . for there was something in his daughter 's manner that filled him with inexpressible terror .
so she went over to her awkward dairymaid . and before she -- but not before he -- was aware of the sweet proximity . she was adjusting his happy awkward arms to the new office of holding a milk strainer over the bowl . and pouring the white liquid through it , `` there , '' said she . looking up for a moment , and half blushing .
four of the bailiff of the palace 's sergeants . perfunctory guardians of all the pleasures of the people . on days of festival as well as on days of execution . stood at the four corners of the marble table , the piece was only to begin with the twelfth stroke of the great palace clock sounding midday . it was very late , no doubt , for a theatrical representation .
in this case , the letters being in the bosom of the girl 's dress . madame [female] could only open them . read them , perform her instructions , seal them . and put them back again by scientific assistance -- which assistance i rendered in a half ounce bottle . the second occasion , when the same means were employed , was the occasion of lady [female] 's arrival in [location] .
it was understood that the ladies were to be assembled in the bazaar at half past two . and that the doors were to be thrown open to the public at three o'clock . soon after half past two mrs mackenzie 's carriage was at the door . and the other mackenzies having come up at the same time , the mackenzie phalanx entered the building together . there were many others with them , but as they walked up they found the countess of [female] standing alone in the centre of the building .
there was an expression of serenity on her face . she even smiled a little , a sort of vague gaiety came over her . such as comes to one who has watched long in agony and suspense by the bed of a sick person and the person is dead . [female] drew the little window curtain aside . stooped down , and looked out and said , `` 'happy the bride the sun shines on ''
that night [female] dreamed that she was back in the little house of mercy . [female] was there ; and [male] ; and [male] . with the patch over his eye , they were waiting for the men to come . and the narrow hall was full of the odor of [female] 's soup . then she heard them coming , the shuffling of many feet on the road .
one speaks of the moods of spring . but the days that are her true children have only one mood . they are all full of the rising and dropping of winds , and the whistling of birds . new flowers may come out , the green embroidery of the hedges increase . but the same heaven broods overhead , soft , thick , and blue .
the dairyman at the upper end with mr clare . who had volunteered to help ; then tess , [male] , izz huett , and retty . then [female] , [female] , and the married dairywomen . [female] , with her wooly [female] hair and rolling eyes . and flaxen [female] , consumptive from the winter damps of the water meads .
unwittingly [female] chose words which were as daggers in the breast of the arab . although made without knowledge of the secret work to which the marabout had vowed himself and all that was his . the young man 's threat sounded like a hint so terrible in its meaning that [male] 's heart turned suddenly to water . he saw himself exposed , defeated , hand and foot in the enemy 's power . how this roumi had wormed out the hidden truth he could not conceive .
she looked at him , and saw that his face was bloodless . and that his head was bound by linen bandages . which concealed his forehead , a fall from his horse ! she remembered how she had seen him once ride by upon the dusty road . unconscious of her presence , grand and self absorbed as count [female] .
half an hour afterwards he was in mr. [male] 's room . a place very precious , everything in it . and there were many things -- had an air of being strange , mr. [male] slept behind curtains of [male] and silver . his floor was covered with some stuff like scarlet velvet . there was a skull in the place of honour on the walls .
no , he could not stop now , he would go on , like the others . and with this advantage , that he was morally certain he could lay his hands on clark at any time . but he would have to prove his case , connect it . who , for instance , was the other man in the cabin ? he must have known who the boy was who lay in that rough bunk , delirious .
in spite of this burning impatience it was nearly evening ere the lighthouse boat began to move . madame had said a great deal both to [female] and the captain touching the arrangements that were to be made for [female] 's benefit . very few men who had the honour of her acquaintance cared to disregard madame 's advice . that sort of contempt might end in being knifed by a stranger in a gambling hell upon surprisingly short provocation . for six days -- two of them were wasted in the crowded canal .
but no rich man 's palace should interfere with the poor man 's right to the river bank . three millions and a half should be spent on the noble street to be constructed . the grandest pathway that the world should ever yet have seen ; three millions and a half to be drawn from . to be drawn from anywhere except from chelsea ; -- from the bloated money bags of the city corporation . vavasor once ventured to declare , amidst the encouraging shouts of the men of chelsea .
he was also assistant surgeon at a small hospital which was maintained in that town . and held two or three other similar public positions , all of which attested his respectability and general proficiency . they , moreover , thoroughly saved him from any of the dangers of idleness . but , unfortunately , they did not enable him to regard himself as a successful professional man . whereas old dr gruffen , of whom but few people spoke well .
in point of area , graustark is but a mite in the great galaxy of nations . glancing over the map of the world , one is almost sure to miss the infinitesimal patch of green that marks its location . one could not be blamed if he regarded the spot as a typographical or topographical illusion . yet the people of this quaint little land hold in their hearts a love and a confidence that is not surpassed by any of the lordly monarchs who measure their patriotism by miles and millions . the graustarkians are a sturdy , courageous race , from the faraway century when they fought themselves clear of the tartar yoke .
heard ye the din of battle bray . lance to lance , and horse to horse , gray . it had been agreed , on account of the heat of the climate . that the judicial combat which was the cause of the present assemblage of various nations at the diamond of the desert should take place at one hour after sunrise . the wide lists , which had been constructed under the inspection of the knight of the leopard .
i got your letter on saturday . and can not help wishing that it had been written in better spirits , however , i do not doubt but that it will all come right soon . i am quite sure that the best thing you can do is to let mr. [male] name an early day . of course you never intended that there should be a long engagement . such a thing , where there is no possible reason for it .
until jan 's last visit to lac bain this hope never quite went out . the first evening after his arrival from the swamps to the west . he came to the cabin , his beard had grown again . his hair was long and shaggy , and fell in shining dishevelment upon his shoulders . the sensitive beauty of his great eyes , once responsive to every passing humor in [location] .
still , he did obey the orders , his anxieties continually glanced towards [male] . and his remembrance of what had taken place between them the morning before was accompanied with sensibilities which had not been roused at all during the actual scene . he had then cared but little about [male] 's painful impressions with regard to the suggested change in the hospital . or about the disposition towards himself which what he held to be his justifiable refusal of a rather exorbitant request might call forth . he recurred to the scene now with a perception that he had probably made [male] his enemy .
during the short time i remained , my company was . naturally , much courted by the young nobles , i was in a constant round of gaiety and diversion . notwithstanding that the court was in mourning , for the country was so rejoiced at the death of the giants . and so many of their lost friends had been restored to the nobility and men of wealth . that the gladness surpassed the grief , ye have indeed left your lives to your people .
the strength , agility , and blind ferocity of these two creatures is approached by nothing known to earthly man . my beast had an advantage in his first hold . having sunk his mighty fangs far into the breast of his adversary . but the great arms and paws of the ape . backed by muscles far transcending those of the martian men i had seen , had locked the throat of my guardian and slowly were choking out his life .
after his first visit [male] said to himself that [male] attracted him just as much as ever . but that he must not yield to that feeling , because to marry her . a girl almost without fortune , would mean ruin to his career . while to renew their former relations without intending to marry her would be dishonorable , [male] made up his mind to avoid meeting [male] . but despite that resolution he called again a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the rostovs ' .
knowing , of course , what the advice would be , she did not press him further . and was about to beckon [male] forward and leave him . when he interrupted her with , oh , one moment . dear [female] -- you will meet me again ? she eventually agreed to see him that day fortnight .
when she came into the drawing room before dinner she found the place empty . but in the course of a moment [male] arrived . his anxiety about his father had been lightened ; sir [male] hope 's view of his condition was less depressed than his own had been . the doctor recommended that the nurse alone should remain with the old man for the next three or four hours . so that [male] , his mother and the great physician himself were free to dine at table .
it was nine o'clock when mr. [male] left the little modern red brick post office situated in one of the principal thoroughfares . that ran steeply inland from the boulevard , and made his way down the hill . nine o'clock was an important hour of the twenty-four to the inhabitants of corbo . for it was then that the late edition of el imparcial [male] corbo made its appearance . the editor and proprietor of that enterprising journal had an arrangement by which the latest european news was sent to him direct from a relative employed on the staff of one of the great parisian papers .
it was certainly nettling to find his air of reserve and displeasure met with such inconsequent lightness . she never seemed to recognize the subtle changes of temperature expressed in his manner . only his sense of what was due to himself prevented his being very chilly indeed . but as she went on with her gay chat . in utter ignorance of his mood , and indulged in some very pretty airy nonsense .
must not be tainted by loose conversation of any kind , if you allow yourself to doubt that my husband was [male] 's father . you personally insult me in the grossest manner . if you have felt , and if you still continue to feel , an unhallowed curiosity on this subject . i recommend you , in your own interests , to check it at once . and for ever , on this side of the grave , mr. [male] .
kind heaven , increase that silvery gleam and bid these clouds depart . and let her soft celestial beam restore my fainting heart ! at that period she was sent to school . her previous life , with the exception of a single half year . had been passed in the absolute retirement of a village parsonage .
no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma . the room at the crown was to witness it . but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd . mr. [male] had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves . for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came .
mr [male] with humility expressed his conviction that bishop could not mean him . and with inconsistency expressed his high gratification in bishop 's good opinion . whether it had occurred to his good friend , that society might not unreasonably hope that one so blest in his undertakings . and whose example on his pedestal was so influential with it . would shed a little money in the direction of a mission or so to [location] ?
the child was at this time two and a half years of age . very young , she seemed , to be thus left by a mother who had appeared to idolize her . the county people shook their heads . they told each other that lady [female] was a hypocrite and an actress . she had never really loved her child .
no -- the footsteps were coming up , not down , some one from the village . perhaps [female] , with provisions , she relaxed again . but the steps were not the steps of [female] . that swift and springy youth ; they were slow and considered . and they kept on pausing , the idea of going back to the house did not occur to her .
with a parting kiss of her fingers to it . she softly closed the door and went with a light foot down the great staircase . pausing and listening as she went , that she might meet none of the household . no one chanced to be about , and she got down to the hall in quiet . the door of the late secretary 's room stood open .
besides these , a casket of magnificent goldwork , with the same arms as the sword and the portrait . formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece , and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture . [male] always carried the key of this coffer about him . but he one day opened it before [male] . and [male] was convinced that this coffer contained nothing but letters and papers .
strange to think they are here too among strange gods , we climbed to where the wild peonies bloom in glory that few eyes see . and the [female] beds of wild sweet strawberries ripen . every hour brought with it some new delight . some exquisiteness of sight or of words that i shall remember for ever . she sat one day on a rock .
chretien belonged to a generation of french poets who rook over a great mass of celtic folk lore they imperfectly understood . and made of what , of course , it had never been before : the vehicle to carry a rich freight of chivalric customs and ideals . as an ideal of social conduct , the code of chivalry never touched the middle and lower classes . but it was the religion of the aristocracy and of the twelfth century `` honnete homme '' never was literature in any age closer to the ideals of a social class .
i looked , on the contrary , through a frame of leafage . clustering round the high lattice , and forth thence to a grassy mead like level . a lawn terrace with trees rising from the lower ground beyond . high forest trees , such as i had not seen for many a day . they were now groaning under the gale of october .
this letter grieved and mortified [male] , in the first place he was sorry that [male] . for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family . should be lost to the home ; and secondly , from his hussar point of view . he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow bolkonski that connection with him was no such great honor after all . and that if he loved [male] he might dispense with permission from his dotard father .
it was too early yet for her fully to recognize or at least admit the change . still more for her to have readjusted that devotedness which was so necessary a part of her mental life that she was almost sure sooner or later to recover it . permanent rebellion , the disorder of a life without some loving reverent resolve . was not possible to her ; but she was now in an interval when the very force of her nature heightened its confusion . in this way , the early months of marriage often are times of critical tumult .
he looked at durrance -- a man so trained to vigour and activity that his very sunburn seemed an essential quality rather than an accident of the country in which he lived . a man , too , who came to the wild , uncitied places of the world with the joy of one who comes into an inheritance . a man to whom these desolate tracts were home . and the fireside and the hedged fields and made roads merely the other places . and he understood the magnitude of the calamity which had befallen him .
`` adopted me ? '' the girl stared , and her blush came back to her . together with a momentary look of pain which gave her interlocutor some alarm . he had underestimated the effect of his words . lord warburton , who appeared constantly desirous of a nearer view of miss archer . strolled toward the two cousins at the moment , and as he did so she rested her wider eyes on him .
while she gazed , she heard a distant chanting rise through the aisles . the sounds swelled in low murmurs on the ear . and drew nearer and nearer , till a sudden blaze of light issued from one of the portals . and the procession entered , the organ instantly sounded a high and solemn peal , and the voices rising altogether swelled the sacred strain . in front appeared the padre abate .
mrs. [female] now felt that she had a serious duty before her . and she soon managed to arrange a tete a tete with [female] , in which she passed from inquiries about [female] 's health . and expressions of her sincere anxiety for her brother 's large family . to general remarks on the dangers which lay before young people with regard to their settlement in life . young men were often wild and disappointing , making little return for the money spent on them .
from the shifting gloom of the stair case to the soft radiance cast through the open door of her bedroom was for poor [female] an almost heartening transition . she stood awhile on the threshold . watching melisande dart to and fro like a shuttle across a loom , already the main part of the packing seemed to have been accomplished . the wardrobe was a yawning void . the carpet was here and there visible , many of the trunks were already brimming and foaming over ...
i think that mrs [female] was wrong . she would have joined that party on the croquet ground . instead of remaining among the pea sticks in her sun bonnet , had she done as i would have counselled her . not a word was spoken among the four that she did not hear , those pea sticks were only removed from the lawn by a low wall and a few shrubs . she listened , not as one suspecting , but simply as one loving .
you are aware that mr [male] gazebee is now staying here . and that he has been here for nearly two months , he is engaged in managing poor papa 's affairs . and mamma , who likes him very much , says that he is a most excellent man of business . of course , you know that he is the junior partner in the very old firm of gumption . gazebee , and gazebee , who , i understand .
the great sin , -- the sin which was so great that to have known it for a day without revealing it was in itself a damning sin on the part of mrs. [female] . was lady [female] 's sin , and she differed so entirely from her father as to think that this sin of her own was a virtue . and that to have spoken of it to him would have been , on the part of mrs. [female] . a treachery so deep that no woman ought to have forgiven it ! when he spoke of a matter which deeply affected his honour .
the horse was not yet ready , but feeling a peculiar concentration of his physical forces and his intellect on what he had to do . he started off on foot without waiting for the horse . and told [location] to overtake him , at the corner he met a night cabman driving hurriedly . in the little sledge , wrapped in a velvet cloak . sat lizaveta petrovna with a kerchief round her head .
there was the hotel with its gateway , and its savoury smell of cooking . there was the cafe with its bright windows , and its rattling of dominoes . there was the dyer 's with its strips of red cloth on the doorposts . there was the silversmith 's with its earrings , and its offerings for altars . there was the tobacco dealer 's with its lively group of soldier customers coming out pipe in mouth .
the men were withdrawn , scotty parsons cut a sapling twelve feet long . and trimmed it , big junko thawed his dynamite at a little fire . opening the ends of the packages in order that the steam generated might escape . otherwise the pressure inside the oiled paper of the package was capable of exploding the whole affair . when the powder was warm , scotty bound twenty of the cartridges around the end of the sapling .
also a letter from [female] , she wants me to come to their camp for two weeks in september . must i ask your permission , or have not i yet arrived at the place where i can do as i please ? yes , i am sure i have -- i am a senior , you know . having worked all summer , i feel like taking a little healthful recreation ; i want to see the adirondacks . i want to see [male] ; i want to see [male] 's brother .
i knew that i could have done nothing else but walk out after dicky uttered his humiliating ultimatum . but i also knew dicky well enough to realize that when he came to himself he would regret what he had done and try to find me . i must make it an easy task for him . so i decided my destination quickly , i would go to my old boarding place . where my mother and i had lived and where i had first met dicky .
but the craft to which we especially refer at the present writing . was a coquette of the first class , beautiful in the extreme . and richly meriting the name that her owners had placed in golden letters on her stern . the `` sea witch , '' she was one of that class of vessels known as flat upon the floor . a model that caused her to draw but little water .
there was once , it may be now many hundred years ago , a good old fisherman . who was sitting one fine evening before his door , mending his nets , the part of the country in which he lived was extremely pretty . the greensward , on which his cottage stood , ran far into the lake . and it seemed as if it was from love for the blue clear waters that the tongue of land had stretched itself out into them . while with an equally fond embrace the lake had encircled the green pasture rich with waving grass and flowers .
but he had been pronounced to be better , and [male] spoke to him cheerfully . when he was taken into the next room by the man who was always at hand to move him . his wife followed him , and soon afterwards returned . and bade [female] good night , she would sit by her husband . and [female] was to go to the room below , that she might receive her lover there .
although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings . mr. and mrs. [female] 's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune . something occurred while they were at hartfield . to make emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave . this was the occurrence : -- the coles had been settled some years in highbury .
till the tsar reached it , each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body . but as soon as he came up it became alive , its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed . through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices , amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone . hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely . and in front of them two men , the emperors .
she did not apply her judgment consciously to [female] . but when she looked at him , a moment later . she rated him lower than at any other time of their acquaintanceship . her answers to mrs. [female] were perfunctory to the verge of rudeness . and to [female] , who watched her narrowly , she seemed further away than was compatible with her physical closeness .
the countess watched the things being packed , was dissatisfied with everything . was constantly in pursuit of petya who was always running away from her , and was jealous of [male] with whom he spent all his time . sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting things packed . but of late sonya had been particularly sad and silent , [male] letter in which he mentioned princess [female] had elicited . in her presence , joyous comments from the countess .
for hettv had the pride not only of a proud nature but of a proud class . the class that pays the most poor rates , and most shudders at the idea of profiting by a poor rate . it had not yet occurred to her that she might get money for her locket and earrings which she carried with her . and she applied all her small arithmetic and knowledge of prices to calculating how many meals and how many rides were contained in her two guineas . and the odd shillings , which had a melancholy look , as if they were the pale ashes of the other bright flaming coin .
they agreed that the weather was of high promise . and [male] kept the talk in that safe direction until it had become easy again . when he gently diverted it to [male] and his quick sense and agreeable qualities when he was delicately dealt with . he likewise dwelt on the indisputable affection he entertained for his wife . [male] did not fail of his effect upon good mr [male] .
it was while her sister was still in this [female] mood of self satisfaction that mademoiselle loire proposed to go tosauveur ( a little town about twelve miles away ) . and collect the rent from one or two houses they owned there . as mademoiselle therèse talked english best , and had the care of the english visitors . she had most of the [female] excursions . so that [female] was quite glad to think the elder sister was now to have a turn .
a few days after the talk with her mother . meg resolved to try a social evening with [female] , so she ordered a nice supper . set the parlor in order , dressed herself prettily . and put the children to bed early , that nothing should interfere with her experiment . but unfortunately demi 's most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed , and that night he decided to go on a rampage .
, when a man gets his wife to gain the confidence of a woman whom he wants to enjoy . and to call on her and talk to her about the wisdom and ability of her husband . that wife is called a wife serving as a go between , in this case the feelings of the woman with regard to the man should also be made known through the wife . when any man sends a girl or a female servant to any woman under some pretext or other . and places a letter in her bouquet of flowers .
mark had pardoned the felons , and as the seneschal . dinas of [location] , found the dwarf wandering in a forest abandoned . he brought him home . and the king had pity and pardoned even him . but his goodness did but feed the ire of the barons .
over a gray hog back of limestone [male] climbed to look down into a little valley of smooth washed boulders and age crumbled rock through which the stream picked its way . he descended to the white margin of sand and turned sharply to the right . where a little pool had formed at the base of a huge rock . and there he stopped , his heart in his throat . every fibre in his body charged with a sudden electrical thrill at what he beheld .
junior did his first real thinking that night . he was ravenous before morning and aghast at what he was offered for breakfast . he was eager to find work and he knew for what his first day 's wage would go . in justice to his own sense of honour and in justice to junior . mere common fairness , such as he would have wanted in like case .
steps moved away , a door closed , i had no time to think of the fresh horror that was preparing . i forgot that the monster was only going out perhaps to perpetrate a fresh crime . i understood but one thing : christine was alone behind the wall ! as we could hear what was said in the next room , there was no reason why my companion should not be heard in his turn . nevertheless , the viscount had to repeat his cry time after time .
one little word he had said to her when they parted . but it had been a word of friendship rather than of love . he had strayed out after her on to the lawn , leaving [organization] alone in the drawing room . perhaps [male] had understood something of the boy 's feelings . and had wished to speak kindly to him at parting , or almost more than kindly .
for the unhappy pilgrim herself there was very good reason . but how could this admirable and poetic man ever have descended into the valley of humiliation . have felt with the man of uz -- as she herself had felt two or three years ago -- my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life . i loathe it ; i would not live alway .
i have just mentioned an acquaintance of sepia 's . who attracted the notice and roused the peculiar interest of mr. [male] . because of a look he saw pass betwixt them . this man spoke both english and french with a foreign accent , and gave himself out as a georgian . count galofta , he called himself .
mrs. [female] told these messages to [male] when he could listen . and he turned towards her his delicate , pinched face . from which all the thick blond hair had been cut away , and in which the eyes seemed to have got larger . yearning for some word about [female] -- wondering what she felt about his illness . no word passed his lips ; but `` to hear with eyes belongs to love 's rare wit , ''
at the french opera house he saw [male] for the first time . she was seated in one of the smaller boxes , dressed in pure white , with white camellias in her hair . her faithful companion , [female] brewer . was seated in the shadow of the curtains , and formed a foil for the beautiful austrian . [male] entered the house with a dissipated and fashionable young parisian .
the valet sat up and whispered something , timokhin , kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg . gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise . dressing jacket , and nightcap , the valet 's sleepy . frightened exclamation , `` what do you want ? what 's the matter ? '' made [male] approach more swiftly to what was lying in the corner .
it was a parish outside the city , lying near the river . very populous , very poor , very low in character , and very uncomfortable , there was a rectory house . queerly situated at the end of a little blind lane . with a gate of its own , and a so called garden about twenty yards square . but the rectory ofdiddulph 's can not be said to have been a comfortable abode .
sir [male] left hallgrove a few days after the fatal accident in the hunting field . and went back to his [location] lodging , which seemed very shabby and comfortless after the luxury of hallgrove rectory . he did not care to spend his evenings at [organization] . for he shrank from hearing [female] 's complaints about her loneliness and poverty . the [location] season had not yet begun , and there were few dupes whom the gamester could victimize by those skilful manoeuvres which so often helped him to success .
in short , possum 's diet raised quite a [female] in the elsinore teapot . and by the time it was over miss west had established this particular contact with me and given me a feeling that we were the mutual owners of the puppy . i noticed , later in the day , that it was to miss west that wada went for instructions as to the quantity of warm water he must use to dilute possum 's condensed milk . lunch won my continued approbation of the cook . in the afternoon i made a trip for'ard to the galley to make his acquaintance .
on descending , i found [female] ( the child called herself [female] . but her full name was [female] ) seated at the breakfast table , by mrs. [female] 's side . a mug of milk stood before her . a morsel of bread filled her hand . which lay passive on the table cloth : she was not eating .
`` come in , chiel , '' a voice exclaimed . before fancy had knocked : a promptness that would have surprised her had she not known that mrs. [female] was an exceedingly and exceptionally sharp woman in the use of her eyes and ears . fancy went in and sat down , [female] was paring potatoes for her husband 's supper . scrape , scrape , scrape ; then a toss . and splash went a potato into a bucket of water .
of course [female] was persuaded before he left mr. [male] 's room . indeed , when he came to think of it , there appeared to him to be no valid reason why he should not sit for loughton . the favour was of a kind that had prevailed from time out of mind in [location] . between the most respectable of the great land magnates , and young rising liberal politicians . [male] , fox , and canning had all been placed in parliament by similar influence .
mrs. [female] , caught surprisedly , struggled to suppress a laugh as she turned to meet her guests . [female] noticed this , he made his introductions . and swiftly thrust peaches precious child into her arms . warning in a whisper : `` you be careful , miss , '' nothing more was necessary . [female] was captivated and would scarcely make way for [male] to offer his greeting .
[female] took with her to the convent . under the canvas lining of her trunk . the results of a laborious and satisfying morning on [male] 's part . no less than a dozen photographs of himself . taken in a dozen different love lorn attitudes , there was a little round photograph for her watch case .
he turned his face eastward as he spoke . and the two girls saw that half eager , half despairing yearning that was always visible in his face when he looked to the east . it was over yonder , the scene of strife . the red field of glory , only separated from him by a patch of purple ocean and a strip of yellow sand . it was yonder , he could almost feel the hot blast of the burning air .
mr. [male] paused and looked round while he was speaking . as if to see where [male] was ; for the children were running on before . [female] was not without a companion , and she had . besides , more pink and white about her than ever , for she held in her hand the wonderful pink and white hot house plant . with a very long name -- a scotch name .
gulielmo 's burning cheek might have sown the pain which raged within his breast . but , nevertheless , he accompanied sartello with a firm and confident stop till they reached the inn where the guests had already begun to assemble . in the porch , by the side of jean maret . sat [female] , with a few flowers in her hair . her countenance as sweet to view as the first blush of a may morn , but when she met the fiery glance which gulielmo cast upon her .
katharine laughed , she looked at [male] . his eyes were meditative , and she wondered what he found in this old gossip to make him ponder so contentedly . she felt , she hardly knew why , a curious pity for him . uncle [male] -- yes , poor [male] , you always called him . why was that ? she asked , to make them go on talking , which , indeed .
not a soul in the room knew where the struggle lay . not even the girl -- for it lay between the [female] eyes of rufe tolliver and the blue eyes of [female] . `` that will do , '' said the deep voice gently , and [female] started toward her . she looked so deadly sick and she trembled so when she tried to rise . but she saw him , her mouth steadied .
my idea worked , i wanted to keep things as they were till the eclipse was total . otherwise they would be trying again to get me to dismiss the darkness . and of course i could not do it . sending for the clothes gained some delay , but not enough , so i had to make another excuse . i said it would be but natural if the king should change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done under excitement .
during the time of my absence , i had of course corresponded with lucilla . her letters to me -- very sad and very short -- reported a melancholy state of things at dimchurch . while i had been away , the dreadful epileptic seizures had attacked oscar with increasing frequency and increasing severity . the moment i could see my way to getting back to england . i wrote to lucilla to cheer her with the intimation of my return .
carlton moved so suddenly that the men behind him looked at him curiously . but he turned , nevertheless , in his chair and faced them . and in order to excuse his doing so beckoned to one of the waiters , he was within two feet of the girl who had been called `` aline . '' she raised her head to speak , and saw carlton staring open eyed at her . she glanced at him for an instant .
now they were at the iron door . here the ground was on a level with the bottom of the pit . but sloped steeply up to the top of its walls elsewhere , so that one could look down inside . the baron unlocked the door and entered with his cowslip wine . which began to be covered with threads of ice as soon as it was set down .
he got up , and [male] could hear him undressing . then he made a nest for [male] on the floor . and stretched himself out in the bunk ; and after that , for a long time . there seemed to be something heavier than the gloom of night in the cabin for [male] . and he listened and waited and prayed in his dog way for nada 's return .
his early thirties found him well on his feet . he was associated with old [male] carhart . who was in those days a national figure , carhart 's physique was like a rough model for a statue of [male] . and his record was just as solid -- a pile made for the pure joy of it . without cheap extortion or shady scandal , he had been a great friend of [male] 's father .
this was the hilltop from which he had ridden down to interfere between [male] and [male] . with that adventure he had opened his account of trouble in the bad lands . an account that was growing day by day . the final balancing of which he could not foresee , from where he stood . the house was dark and lonely as an abandoned habitation , it seemed .
he was summoned ; and the great man of the occasion contented himself with holding his hands up to the heavens as he stood up from his chair . and , exclaiming twice , `` mis sent the monarch 's pouch , mis sent the monarch 's pouch ! '' that young man never knew how he escaped from the board room . but for a time he was deprived of all power of exertion . and could not resume his work till he had had six months
jane slowly turned and looked at him , she had never seen anything so radiant as his face . but still those shining eyes smote her like swords , she longed to cover them with her hands . or bid him look away over the woods and water . while he went on saying these sweet things to her , she put up one foot on the low parapet . leaned her elbow on her knee .
`` yas , aunt sally , '' he murmured . his eyes thanked her with one look for the tone or the hope her words held out . again the laugh , nearer this time , and again the wild look of haunting fear in his face . he dropped where he stood and slipped stealthily as a cat back to the place where he had lain . and crawling on his belly toward a heap of dead leaves caught by the brush of an old fallen pine .
clown , i would play lord pandarus of phrygia . sir , to bring a cressida to this troilus , [male] . this fellow is wise enough to play the fool ; and to do that well craves a kind of wit . he must observe their mood on whom he jests . the quality of persons , and the time .
`` gone to bed , '' replied the voice of demyan the house steward . who was downstairs , then the voice said something more , demyan replied , and the steps in the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly . `` you did not get my letter ? '' he asked . and not waiting for a reply -- which he would not have received , for the princess was unable to speak . he turned back , rapidly mounted the stairs again with the doctor who had entered the hall after him ( they had met at the last post station ) .
his family had by that time started back to shirt sleeves . through a sudden decline in the sugar market , and it had already unbuttoned its vest . so to speak , when [male] went to work , his mind was that exquisite tabula rasa that a university education sometimes leaves . but he had both energy and influence . so he used his former ability as a dodging half back in twisting through wall street crowds as runner for a bank .
it was a slow train , unluckily for [male] 's impatience . which stopped everywhere , and the journey to [location] took him over an hour . it was past nine when a hansom drove him into coleman street . a dull unfrequented looking thoroughfare between tottenham court road and gower street . overshadowed a little by the adjacent gloom of the university hospital .
but marius could no longer hear him , for at that moment he was turning the corner of the rue [male] . the octogenarian raised his hands to his temples two or three times with an expression of anguish . recoiled tottering , and fell back into an arm chair , pulseless , voiceless , tearless . with quivering head and lips which moved with a stupid air . with nothing in his eyes and nothing any longer in his heart except a gloomy and profound something which resembled night .
little pleasures came from time to time . christmas day they spent with the hopes . who from first to last proved the kindest and most helpful of friends to them . the young men from the high valley were there also , and the day was brightly kept . from the home letters by the early mail to the grand merry making and dance with which it wound up .
in the spring mr. [male] took his wife and daughter to [location] . where they spent a couple of months in clarges street . and saw a good deal of society in what may he called the upper range of middle class life . rich merchants and successful professional men living in fine houses at the west end . enlivened with a sprinkling from the ranks of the baronetage and lesser nobility .
she decided to go out into the [location] afternoon again and get something to eat in an aerated bread shop or some such place . and perhaps find a cheap room for herself , of course that was what she had to do . she had to find a cheap room for herself and work ! this room no , 47 was no more than a sort of railway compartment on the way to that . she walked along the strand and across trafalgar square .
a really irresistible man -- courteous , considerate , delightfully free from pride . a gentleman , every inch of him . as i drove away to the station i felt as if i could cheerfully do anything to promote the interests of sir [male] . anything in the world , except drawing the marriage settlement of his wife . a week passed , after my return to [location] .
where did i leave off ? ah , yes -- she fainted after drinking a cup of tea with the countess . a proceeding which might have interested me if i had been her medical man . but being nothing of the sort i felt bored by hearing of it , nothing more . when she came to herself in half an hour 's time she was on the sofa . and nobody was with her but the landlady .
but he drank more now , and sat longer over his drink , and there was an aspect of trouble and uneasiness about him at times which fairly puzzled his wife . of course the most natural solution for all this was the one offered by the dismally prophetic [male] . [male] had been speculating or gambling , and his affairs were in disorder . he was not a man to be affected by anything but the most sordid considerations . one would suppose , say that he had lost money , and there you had a key to the whole .
but one , the boldest , the ringleader , said nothing , his brows darkened . and the wicked gleam came and sat in his hard eyes with a green light . he drew a little apart from the rest . and walked on more rapidly , when he came to the place where they had left their horses . he took his and went on toward the cabin with a look that did not invite the others to follow .
vronsky and [female] had been traveling for three months together in [location] . they had visited [female] , [female] , and naples . and had just arrived at a small italian town where they meant to stay some time . a handsome head waiter , with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards . an evening coat , a broad white cambric shirt front .
to much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights . and when i passed the room , in going downstairs to dinner . i saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete order . only the bed was stripped of its hangings , leah stood up in the window seat . rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke .
they chatted incessantly : about the things around them . their amusing adventure out in the water . it had again assumed its entertaining aspect ; about the wind . the trees , the people who had gone to the cheniere . about the children playing croquet under the oaks .
he was quite distinctly a man now , and his horse was going rapidly . once it seemed as if he waved his arms . but she turned her head . and urged her horse with sudden fright , they were almost to the top now . she dismounted and clambered alongside of the animal up the steep incline .
other amusements were not wanting on these festive occasions , our repasts were generally followed by the songs and dances of the two young people . [female] the happiness of pastoral life . and the misery of those who were impelled by avarice to cross the raging ocean . rather than cultivate the earth , and enjoy its bounties in [female] . sometimes she performed a pantomime with [female] .
she was walking to church with octavia , and they were driving in the opposite direction . jerome had his new buggy and crimson lap robe . his horse 's coat shone like satin and had rosettes of crimson on his bridle . jerome was dressed extremely well and looked quite young , with his round , ruddy , clean shaven face and clear blue eyes . [male] was sitting primly and consciously by his side ; she was a very handsome girl with bold eyes and was somewhat overdressed .
but , let [female] avow it , this idea . which seemed natural at the first blush , appeared to him after a moment 's reflection . as strange , impossible , and almost repulsive , for , at bottom , he shared the general impression . and the old member of the convention inspired him . without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself , with that sentiment which borders on hate .
he reached a druggist 's shop , and entered . the druggist ( whose smooth manners seemed to have been salved over with his own spermaceti ) . listened attentively to barton 's description of davenport 's illness . concluded it was typhus fever , very prevalent in that neighbourhood ; and proceeded to make up a bottle of medicine . sweet spirits of nitre , or some such innocent potion .
she disappeared in a kind of sulphurous apotheosis . and when a few years later [female] again came back to [location] . subdued , impoverished , mourning a third husband , and in [female] of a still smaller house . people wondered that her rich niece had not been able to do something for her . then came the news that [female] 's own marriage had ended in disaster .
this grievance had naturally gathered emphasis as the years advanced . and lady [female] , after having had three daughters in quick succession . had remained for eight years till now that she was over forty without producing so much as another girl . while sir [male] , almost twenty years older . was at a time of life when , notwithstanding the fashionable retardation of most things from dinners to marriages .
adela gave a little impatient sigh , she was thinking how gladly she would have made this man master of her ample fortune . wondering whether he would ever claim from her the allegiance she was so ready to give . mrs. [female] kept a sharp watch upon [female] throughout the evening . plunging into the conversation every now and then with a somewhat dictatorial and infallible air . and generally contriving to drag some praise of [female] into her talk .
it might have been half past eight o'clock in the evening . the day was declining , [male] laid marius down along the wall . on the dry portion of the vaulting , then he went to the grating and clenched both fists round the bars . the shock which he gave it was frenzied . but it did not move , the grating did not stir , [male] seized the bars one after the other .
there were assembled in this apartment , around a large oaken table . about a dozen of the most distinguished representatives of the saxon families in the adjacent counties . they were all old , or , at least , elderly men ; for the younger race . to the great displeasure of the seniors , had , like ivanhoe . broken down many of the barriers which separated for half a century the norman victors from the vanquished saxons .
but mr moffat hardly escaped on easier terms , the trade by which his father had made his money was as well known as that of the railway contractor . and every possible symbol of tailordom was displayed in graphic portraiture on the walls and hoardings of the city . he was drawn with his goose , with his scissors . with his needle , with his tapes ; he might be seen measuring . cutting , stitching , pressing , carrying home his bundle , and presenting his little bill .
sir hugh had spent the greatest part of this day at home . immersed among his guns and rods , and their various appurtenances . he also had breakfasted at his club , but had ordered his luncheon to be prepared for him at home . he had arranged to leave berkeley square at four . and had directed that his lamb chops should be brought to him exactly at three .
as to his personal conduct and behaviour there , the brothers overwhelmed him with directions and advice . nor did they fail to draw out of the strong box in the thick wall of their counting house a more than sufficient sum of money for all possible expenses . [male] had never had so much in his hands before , and hesitated to take it . saying it was more than he should require ; but they repeated . with fresh urgency , their warnings about the terrible high prices of [location] .
there had been a final rupture between [female] and mrs. [female] a few days before . and that matron , having shown her cards a little too plainly , had been routed by an unwonted display of spirit on the part of the pretty little widow . she was gone , carrying all her belongings with her . and leaving [female] and liberty behind her . the flush of triumph was still upon mrs. [female] .
he vaguely felt , too , that what he called his new convictions were not merely lack of knowledge . but that they were part of a whole order of ideas . in which no knowledge of what he needed was possible , the question was summed up for him thus . if i do not accept the answers christianity gives to the problems of my life . what answers do i accept ? and in the whole arsenal of his convictions .
he lived in the north of england . where he had a small training stable , and his mother never heard of him except through the sporting papers . `` he has not been here for four years , '' mrs. [female] said . he hates the place ; he would not care if i were to burn it down tomorrow ... however , i do the best i can , hoping that one day he will marry and come and live here .
while she smote him with one hand . she sued for pardon with the other ; and the contradiction was so characteristic . it explained and excused in so touching a way the inconsistencies of her impulsive heart and hesitating mind . that he was filled with that tender compunction . that searching sense of his own shortcomings , which generous natures feel when they find they have underrated the generosity of others .
of course he could not but think much of the immense property which was now . for a short time , altogether in his own hands , his resolution was soon made to go at once to [location] and consult the best lawyer he could find . or the best dozen lawyers should such be necessary -- as to the validity of [male] 's claims . this must be done before he said a word to her or to any of the gresham family . but it must be done instantly , so that all suspense might be at an end as soon as possible .
the servants joyfully obeyed , and the marquis locking the several doors . returned with the keys to the habitable part of the castle . every enquiry after [male] had hitherto proved fruitless . and the imperious nature of the marquis , heightened by the present vexation . became intolerably oppressive to all around him , as the hope of recovering [male] declined .
[male] was the author of about half a dozen highly spiced fictions . which enjoyed an immense popularity amongst the classes who like their literature as they like their tobacco , very strong . sigismund had never in his life presented himself before the public in a complete form . he appeared in weekly numbers at a penny . and was always so appearing ; and except on one occasion when he found himself .
angel , i live entirely for you , i love you too much to blame you for going away . and i know it was necessary you should find a farm . do not think i shall say a word of sting or bitterness , only come back to me . i am desolate without you , my [male] . o , so desolate , i do not mind having to work : but if you will send me one little line .
that is the theory , the laborers on calumet k . with some others at work in the neighborhood . had organized into a lodge and had affiliated with the [female] federation of labor . grady , who had appeared out of nowhere , who had urged upon them the need of combining against the forces of oppression . and had induced them to organize , had been , without dissent , elected delegate .
her face was rather round than oval and the chin was dimpled . the mouth , too , when she smiled caused other dimples to leap into play . and one could easily imagine that she very often did smile , the eyes , large and dark . laughed and danced beneath a pair of perfectly drawn brows . fairly thick and arching , and tapering down to a point that looked like a single hair at their ends .
sometimes , in the midst of his reading , no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand . he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation , whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself . these lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them . we now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled correspondence of lord [male] with generals [male] . [male] , and the admirals on the [male] station .
at the end of a walk of about ten minutes among the tents and posts . which were closer together near the headquarters , monk entered upon a little causeway which diverged into three branches . that on the left led to the river , that in the middle to newcastle [male] on the marsh . that on the right crossed the first lines of monk 's camp . that is to say , the lines nearest to [male] 's army .
he looked at the latter first , she was clad in yellow . and was very tall , thin and fierce looking ; so fierce looking that [male] involuntarily jerked his head back . and brought it with painful force in contact with the wall . it was the tiger herself . and her companion was the coarse , dreadful looking man called [female] .
[female] had said she would join the vyses . mrs. [female] was an acquaintance of her mother . so there was no impropriety in the plan and miss [female] had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly . finally nothing happened ; but the coolness remained , and , for [female] . was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows .
that they are right in these facts i do not doubt ; but in giving such advice they look only to facts . having no regard to the conscience , i do not blame them . i should give such advice myself . knowing that a friend may give counsel as to outer things . but that a man must satisfy his inner conscience by his own perceptions of what is right and what is wrong .
people who had come up from the country for the day were picnicking on the grass . and [female] walked along the gravel paths and under the aged limes . but finding this place rather dull she returned to the streets . and watched the carriages drawing up for the concert , numerous dons and their wives . and undergraduates with gay female companions , crowding up likewise , when the doors were closed .
the victim was bound upon this wheel , on his knees . with his hands behind his back , a wooden shaft . which set in motion a capstan concealed in the interior of the little edifice . imparted a rotatory motion to the wheel , which always maintained its horizontal position . and in this manner presented the face of the condemned man to all quarters of the square in succession .
the green grass ran everywhere -- along the roadside . round the great stump roots , over the rough pasture fields . softening and smoothing wherever it went , the woods were flushing purple . with just a tinge of green from the bursting buds . the balsams and spruces still stood dark in the swamps .
the cook here turned to me , saying that mrs. [female] was waiting for me . so i departed , i hardly heard mrs. [female] 's account of the curtain conflagration during dinner . so much was i occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical character of [female] poole . and still more in pondering the problem of her position at thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into custody that morning . or , at the very least , dismissed from her master 's service , he had almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night .
it was nearly midnight , and the moon had sunk behind the hill that sheltered the harbor on the north . leaving the dark water of the bay in deep shadow . at long gunshot from the shore lay the ship in which [male] bramble was confined . all was still as death , save the pace of the sentinel in the ship 's waist . and a ripple now and then of tide way against the ship 's cable .
as she came to the gate at the lower end of the lane a man who was leaning over it started . with a quick intake of his breath , which , in any other man than romney penhallow . or for any other woman than [female] , would have been an exclamation of surprise . [male] recognized him with a great deal of annoyance and a little relief . she would not have to walk home alone , but with romney penhallow !
mr. [male] went out into the garden again . he had done something , at any rate . he had arranged for getting this woman out of the way . if -- if by any remote chance there might be yet a possibility of keeping the secret of [male] 's existence . here was one witness already got rid of , but was there any chance ? mr. [male] sat down on a rickety old garden seat .
when king lot had espied king [male] . he knew him well , then he said . o jesu , defend [male] from death and horrible maims ! for i see well we be in great peril of death . for i see yonder a king , one of the most worshipfullest men and one of the best knights of the world .
thereupon he ordered the artists to be shown in . who , for the last two hours , had been walking up and down outside the door behind which fame and fortune . or dismissal -- awaited them , the whole day was spent in discussing . negotiating , signing or cancelling contracts ; and the two overworked managers went to bed early . without so much as casting a glance at box five to see whether [male] debienne and [male] poligny were enjoying the performance .
`` 'they who give to the poor lend to the lord , '' and practical christianity is the kind he loves the best , was all [male] answered , but it silenced the aunts and caused even prudent uncle [male] to think with sudden satisfaction of certain secret investments he had made which paid him no interest but the thanks of the poor . [male] and [male] looked well pleased and promised their advice and assistance with the enthusiasm of generous young hearts . [male] his head , but said nothing .
all were ready , the barricade , which had long been silent , poured forth a desperate fire . seven or eight discharges followed , with a sort of rage and joy . the street was filled with blinding smoke , and , at the end of a few minutes . athwart this mist all streaked with flame , two thirds of the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of the cannons . those who were left standing continued to serve the pieces with severe tranquillity , but the fire had slackened .
well , then , it was so far settled yesterday that i am to take the management o ', the woods . the captain sent for me t offer it me . when i was seeing to the poles and things here and i have agreed [location] . but if anybody asks any questions upstairs .
and thereafter , for an hour , as they wandered through the may time sweetness of the forest . she would permit him to talk of only yellow bird and sun cloud . and , one thing leading to another , she learned how it was that yellow bird had been his fairy in childhood days . and how he came to be an outlaw for her in later manhood . her eyes were shining when he had finished , and her red lips were a tremble with the quickness of her breathing .
those words , in themselves true and lovely , but wrested to false meaning . whose fatal sound was now dying out of [location] , merged in the equally false and fatal shout of `` gloire ! gloire ! '' remind me of an event which i believe was the first that broke the delicious monotony of our new life . it was one september morning . mrs. [female] , the children .
but he found observation endless . and that he was `` like a child who with a shell digs a hole in the sand to receive the waters of the ocean . '' he elsewhere humbly says , that not only the general history of nature . but even that of the smallest plant , was far beyond his ability , before , however . speaking further of him as an author , it will be necessary to recapitulate the chief events of his life .
i went directly to the rear of the house and found bates putting the dishes away in the pantry . but there was substance enough in our dangers without pursuing shadows . certain things were planned that night , we determined to exercise every precaution to prevent a surprise from without . and we resolved upon a new and systematic sounding of walls and floors . taking our clue from the efforts made by [male] and his ally to find hiding places by this process .
to continue the discussion seemed hopeless , i was silent , thinking of what i had heard . that there were others like her somewhere in that vast green world . so much of it imperfectly known , so many districts never yet explored by white men . true , it was strange that no report of such a race had reached the ears of any traveller . yet here was rima herself at my side , a living proof that such a race did exist .
he looked helplessly about him for a moment . fixed his watery eyes on [male] as if he wanted to burst into sobs but dare not for fear of the noise . then turned on his chair and seemed on the point of taking to flight . but just at that instant his dog , which had followed him into the room . planted its forelegs on the counterpane and looked impudently into [male] 's face .
as he gazed , his senses seemed leaving him . and unconsciously he spoke aloud ; [male] , what shall i do , the room in which father salvierderra always slept when at the senora moreno 's house was the southeast corner room . it had a window to the south and one to the east . when the first glow of dawn came in the sky . this eastern window was lit up as by a fire , the father was always on watch for it .
slowly lisbeth drew down her apron , and timidly she opened her dim dark eyes . she saw nothing at first but a face . a pure , pale face , with loving grey eyes . and it was quite unknown to her , her wonder increased ; perhaps it was an angel . but in the same instant dinah had laid her hand on lisbeth 's again .
violet says that it is the only speech she ever read . i was there , and was delighted , i was sure that it was in you to do it . i suppose we shall see you after the house is up . but i write this as i shall barely have an opportunity of speaking to you then . i shall be in portman square , not at home , from six till seven .
while all details were still a mystery to me . the vile manner in which the personal resemblance between the woman in white and lady [female] had been turned to account was clear beyond a doubt . it was plain that [female] had been introduced into count [female] 's house as lady [female] . it was plain that lady [female] had taken the dead woman 's place in the asylum . the substitution having been so managed as to make innocent people ( the doctor and the two servants certainly .
if hereafter you should persist in the harsh intention you express . i must suffer it , that i shall suffer be assured , he dispatched that letter by [male] groom . and conceived this to be the end of the matter , it cut him keenly . but he bore the wound with that outward stoicism he affected . next morning , at a quarter past eight , as with le chapelier .
mrs. arundel and [female] took matters quite out of the hands of the two lovers . the elderly lady fixed the wedding day , by agreement with [female] lawford . and sketched out the route for the wedding tour , the younger lady chose the fabrics for the dresses of the bride and her attendants . and all was done before [female] and [female] well knew what their friends were about . i think that mrs. arundel feared her son might change his mind if matters were not brought swiftly to a climax .
he was not wholly unconscious , he knew that as soon as he had fallen the half breed had turned again to the dogs . he could hear him as he straightened out the traces . in a subconscious sort of way , [male] wondered why he did not take advantage of his opportunity and finish what he had failed to do with the bullet through the window . [male] heard him run back for his gun . and tried to struggle to his knees , instead of the shot he half expected there came the low `` hoosh -- hoosh , marche ! ''
then mrs. [female] looked at mr. [male] . but made no immediate reply ; nor did she say anything further about [female] 's journey . she looked at mr. [female] . and will caught her eye , and understood that he was being rebuked for not having carried out that little scheme which had been prepared for him . but he had come to hate the scheme , and almost hated mrs. [male] for proposing it .
mrs. fain , he is an humble servant to foible . my mother 's woman , and may win her to your interest , mira . care is taken for that , she is won and worn by this time . they were married this morning , mira . waitwell and foible . i would not tempt my servant to betray me by trusting him too far .
for an hour or more the three adventurers followed their strange guide in silence through the dense , trackless woods . he walked very rapidly , looking neither to the right nor to the left , finding his way apparently by an intuitive sense of direction . occasionally he glanced back over his shoulder and smiled , walking through the woods here was not difficult . and the party made rapid progress , the huge , upstanding tree trunks were devoid of limbs for a hundred feet or more above the ground . on some of them a luxuriant vine was growing -- a vine that bore a profusion of little gray berries .
at first she was embarrassed by the obligation of meeting [female] . on whom her definite refusal had produced an effect for which she could not hold herself blameless . she had not kept her promise of seeing him on the day after their encounter at the post office . but had written , instead , in terms which obviously made such a meeting unnecessary . but all her efforts to soften the abruptness of her answer could not conceal .
any one else in his place would have shared our good old friend 's opinion . if i were asked , at this moment , to say plainly what defects i have discovered in sir [male] . i could only point out two , one , his incessant restlessness and excitability . which may be caused , naturally enough , by unusual energy of character , the other . his short , sharp , ill tempered manner of speaking to the servants -- which may be only a bad habit after all .
being provident ( and lazy , for i have learned that it takes time and labour to manufacture home-made bombs ) . i pinched off the live end of the fuse in my hand . but the fuse of the first bomb , rolling about on the main deck . merely fizzled on ; and as i waited i resolved to shorten my remaining fuses . any of the men who fled , had he had the courage .
the poor child arose mechanically and went out , she did not understand why she was wanted . she scarcely cared , she merely went because she was told . but when she looked up at priscilla gower . she caught her breath and drew back . but priscilla held out her hand to her , `` come , '' she commanded .
the priest had seen many sights from his parlour window during those two days . on monday he had seen , early in the morning . mr. [male] ride out with his men to go to my lord shrewsbury . who was in the neighbourhood , and had seen him return in time for dinner . with a number of strangers , among whom was an ecclesiastic , on inquiry .
it took half a day to get there and half a day to get back . and at midday i used to kindle a fire of twigs and make a princely banquet of toasted bread and bacon . and then , sitting down on the dizzy edge of the rock . i would tackle the impossible artistic problem -- at least it was impossible to me . beneath my feet , in the foreground , was a dark spot formed by a crown of beech trees .
he was sitting in a corner against the wall . and had in his hands a copy of the sphere . which was so large when held high and wide open that the reader could hide behind it . he had been in his corner for fifteen or twenty minutes when [male] grayle arrived . glancing over the top of his paper with a sort of jaunty carelessness every few minutes at the crowd moving toward the restaurant .
then the sky became bright , and the flock of birds descended on the tree and began to sing . but sir owen heeded them not , but mounted his horse . dressed his shield and lance , and prepared for the combat . there came a mourning cry through the wood . and a sky blue knight on a high stepping destrier dashed through the trees towards sir owen .
he called on mr. [male] . the local builder , -- a most reasonable and respectful man -- who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof . but pointed out that slates were cheaper , he ventured to differ , however , about the corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows . saying that , for his part , he liked to relieve the facade by a bit of decoration . sir [male] hinted that a column , if possible , should be structural as well as decorative .
with the [female] night above them . with the fierce wind howling around them , sweeping across a broad expanse of hidden country . blowing as if it had arisen simultaneously from every point of the compass . and making those wanderers the focus of its ferocity . the two women walked through the darkness down the hill upon which mount stanning stood .
she looked at her ring and tried to recall some of the tender things he had said to her . but harvey eluded her , she could not hear his voice . and when she tried to see him it was harvey of the wide face and the angry eyes of the last days that she saw . morley 's comforted her , the man at the door had been there for forty years . and was beyond surprise , he had her story in twenty-four hours .
there was a great drumming in jolly [male] 's head . and for a time he failed even to hear [male] yelping at their side . for all the world was drowned in those moments by the breaking sobs in nada 's breath and the wild thrill of her body in his arms . and he saw nothing but the upturned face . crushed close against his breast , and the wide-open eyes , and the lips to kiss .
`` el hamdou lillah , god be praised , '' he whispered . as the yellow automobile vanished from sight and maïeddine came out from the cluster of [male] tents in the yellow sand . next day , lella [male] was well enough to begin the march again . they started , in the same curtained carriage , at that moment before dawn while it is still dark . and a thin white cloth seems spread over the dead face of night .
[female] never would go , of course , but jerome faithfully gave her the chance . old esek rather favoured jerome 's suit . for [male] was the plainest of his many daughters . and no other fellow seemed at all anxious to run jerome off the track ; but she took her own way with true stockard firmness . and matters were allowed to drift on at the will of time or chance .
and daily , hourly , the hideous instrument of torture claimed its many victims . old men , young women , tiny children until the day when it would finally demand the head of a king and of a beautiful young queen . but this was as it should be : were not the people now the rulers of [location] ? every [location] was a traitor , as his ancestors had been before him . for two hundred years now the people had sweated , and toiled , and starved .
some wrapped in shawls to shroud them from the night air . some , less cautiously emerging from the rooms within , leaned over the marble balustrade and showed their jewelled arms in the dim hazy light . while around and about them gay uniforms and costumes abounded . as [male] gave himself up to the excitement of the music . young massy , more interested by the aspect of the scene .
the happiness he had dreamed of was given to him . nay , he knew joy and tenderness even more high and sweet than his fancy had painted . as camylott had been in his childhood so he saw it again . the most beauteous home in [location] and the happiest , its [female] the fairest woman and the most nobly loving . as his own father and mother had found life a joyful thing and their world full of warm hearts and faithful friends .
`` i must reach home before the people are out of church , '' she at length said wearily , `` i wish nobody to know i have been out this morning . '' and forbidding swithin to cross into the open in her company she left him on the edge of the isolated plantation . which had latterly known her tread so well , [male] crossed the field and the park beyond . and found on passing the church that the congregation was still within , there was no hurry for getting indoors .
in their cells , they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations . of which they must never speak , on the day when a novice makes her profession . she is dressed in her handsomest attire . she is crowned with white roses , her hair is brushed until it shines , and curled . then she prostrates herself ; a great [female] veil is thrown over her .
a knock at the door , `` come in , '' called [female] . not looking around , till a rushing sound of feet trying to step carefully , called him out of himself . `` now -- now , '' two or three swifter than the others , darted for the chair . but [male] was not in it , on the other side of it . looking at them , his hands out of his pockets , he stood .
they attributed the change to her marriage . and perhaps some deep instinct did warn her not to travel further from her husband than was inevitable . yet the main cause lay deeper still ; she had outgrown stimulants . and was passing from words to things , it was doubtless a pity not to keep up with wedekind or [female] . but some closing of the gates is inevitable after thirty .
the elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya . belonging to one of the best families in [location] , but she was poor . and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections , she had now come to petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son . it was , in fact , solely to meet prince vasili that she had obtained an invitation to [male] pavlovna 's reception and had sat listening to the vicomte 's story . prince vasili 's words frightened her .
[female] galloped off , reached the duke , and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited him . [male] at once remembered the circumstance , and suspecting that something was going on in [location] of which it was necessary he should be informed . he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was . and recognizing from afar the uniform of the guards , he put his horse into a gallop . and rode straight up to [male] , [male] discreetly kept in the background .
the women gathered round the windows , fascinated to look on the scene which terrified them . mrs. [female] , the women servants . [female] , -- all were there , [female] had returned , screaming up stairs as if pursued at every step . and had thrown herself in hysterical sobbing on the sofa . mrs. [female] watched for her son .
truth to say , from the moment he crossed this new steed . it was no longer [male] who was travelling , -- it was a good man clothed in an iron gray justaucorps . brown haut de chausses , holding the medium between a priest and a layman . that which brought him nearest to the churchman was , that [male] had placed on his head a calotte of threadbare velvet . and over the calotte , a large [male] hat .
but will 's articles and speeches naturally recommended him in families which the new strictness of party division had marked off on the side of reform . he was invited to mr. [male] 's ; but here he could not lie down on the rug . and mrs. [female] felt that his mode of talking about catholic countries . as if there were any truce with [male] , illustrated the usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men . at mr. [male] 's , however , whom the irony of events had brought on the same side with [female] in the national movement .
little [female] , entrusted with the alarm clock . was the first up in the morning in the fearful biting cold of an extinct camp . he lighted his lantern and with numb hands raked the ashes from the stove . a few sticks of dried pine topped by split wood of birch or maple . all well dashed with kerosene , took the flame eagerly , then he awakened the cook .
there was something in it which softened his heart to the young man . or perhaps it was that in the midst of his many discomforts he wished to find something which at least was not painful to him . that his son and his heir should insist on entering political life in opposition to him was of course a source of pain . but , putting that aside , the thing had been done pleasantly enough , and the young member 's letter had been written with some good feeling . so he answered the letter as pleasantly as he knew how .
mrs. [male] had , it is true , not been esteemed as holding any very high rank while shining as a beauty under the name of [female] comfort . but she had taken kindly to her new honours , and was now reckoned as a considerable magnate in that part of the county . she did not customarily join in the festivities of the town . and held herself aloof from people even of higher standing than the tappitts . but she was an ambitious woman , and had inspired her lord with the desire of representing [female] in parliament .
at the sound she dropped his hand and rose from her knees . what her suspicions , what her instincts were she could not have clearly defined . but her action was unhesitating , without a moment 's uncertainty she turned to the fireplace . pressed the electric button , and flooded the room with light , there is no force so demoralizing as unexpected light . loder took a step backward , his hand hanging unguarded by his side .
he paused in his labours for a moment to lean with her against the banister . was he going to throw her down ? self solicitude was near extinction in her . and in the knowledge that he had planned to depart on the morrow . possibly for always , she lay in his arms in this precarious position with a sense rather of luxury than of terror . if they could only fall together , and both be dashed to pieces , how fit , how desirable .
the one fatal point at which the resemblance ceased , was in the eyes . the divinely beautiful eyes of [female] 's virgin were lost in the living likeness of her that confronted me now . there was no deformity ; there was nothing to recoil from , in my blind lucilla . the poor , dim , sightless eyes had a faded , changeless , inexpressive look . and that was all , above them , below them , round them .
such had been the life of [male] vavasor . and such was his character , and such his appearance , he had always lived alone in [location] . and did so at present ; but just now his sister was much with him . as she was staying up in town with an aunt . another vavasor by birth , with whom the reader will .
he was still a pale young gentleman , and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness . that did not seem indicative of natural strength , he had not a handsome face . but it was better than handsome : being extremely amiable and cheerful , his figure was a little ungainly . as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it . but it looked as if it would always be light and young , whether mr. [male] 's local work would have sat more gracefully on him than on me .
the church itself had originally been founded by the boissey family . and considerably enlarged by the widow of a [male] molle . whose husband had fallen at agincourt , `` as a memorial for ever . '' there , upon the porch , were carved the `` hawks '' of the [male] molles . wreathed round with palms of victory .
was it a guilty conscience , the dull slow agony of remorse . which had stricken this man down -- this strong powerfully built man , who was a stranger to illness and all physical suffering ? was the body only crushed by the burden of the mind ? [male] could not find any answer to these questions . he only knew that his sometime friend lay there helpless .
there was a flutter in the little dining room -- the sensitiveness of habitual solitude makes hearts beat for preternaturally small reasons . and a guessing as to who the visitor might be , it was some military gentleman from the camp perhaps , no . that was impossible , it was the parson ? no ; he would not come at dinner time . it was the well informed man who travelled with drapery and the best birmingham earrings ? not at all ; his time was not till thursday at three , before they could think further the visitor moved forward another step .
she bade him good night . as he turned from the telephone , his father looked up . what are you going to do tomorrow , lad ? ', he queried . he broke off abruptly , for he had just remembered that he was to dine at the pennington house the following thursday . and he was not the sort of man who smilingly breaks bread with his enemy .
the sneer had an effect that he could not have foreseen . and that susy herself had not expected , oh , do not -- do not let [female] speak to each other like that ! ', she cried . and sinking down by the dressing table she hid her face in her hands . it seemed to her , now , that nothing mattered except that their love for each other . their faith in each other , should be saved from some unhealable hurt , she was willing to tell [female] everything .
only on the belgian front was there small change , the shattered army was being freshly outfitted . [male] was sending money and ammunition . and on the sand dunes small bodies of fresh troops drilled and smiled grimly and drilled again . but there were not , as in [male] and in [location] , great bodies of young men to draw from . too many had been caught beyond the german wall of steel , yet a wave of renewed courage had come with the sun and the green fields .
florizel , not any yet ; but as the unthought on accident is guilty to what we wildly do . so we profess ourselves to be the slaves of chance . and flies of every wind that blows , camillo . sent by the king your father to greet him and to give him comforts . sir , the manner of your bearing towards him . with what you as from your father , shall deliver , things known betwixt [male] three .
it was very consoling to birkin , to think this , if humanity ran into a cul [female] sac and expended itself . the timeless creative mystery would bring forth some other being , finer , more wonderful . some new , more lovely race , to carry on the embodiment of creation . the game was never up , the mystery of creation was fathomless . infallible , inexhaustible , forever , races came and went , species passed away , but ever new species arose .
he took him to one that was behind the door . holding up the candle that he might see , the shelf had a box or two on it . besides books , and these he opened and set on the table . robin looked in , as he was told , but could understand nothing that he saw . in one was a round ball of crystal on a little gold stand .
a low knocking at the door was heard in the midst of this stillness . startling all the inmates of the cottage ; for there are times when a little circumstance . happening quite unexpectedly , can unduly alarm us , but there was here the additional cause of alarm that the enchanted forest lay so near . and that the little promontory seemed just now inaccessible to human beings , they looked at each other doubtingly . as the knocking was repeated accompanied by a deep groan , and the knight sprang to reach his sword .
lady audley sat in the glow of firelight and wax candles in the luxurious drawing room . the amber damask cushions of the sofa contrasting with her dark violet velvet dress . and her rippling hair falling about her neck in a golden haze . everywhere around her were the evidences of wealth and splendor . while in strange contrast to all this , and to her own beauty ; the awkward groom stood rubbing his bullet head as my lady explained to him what she intended to do for her confidential maid .
but as he had not turned down this street , and had not been seen by lord fawn . who was known to walk very slowly , and had often been seen to go by berkeley square . it was presumed that he had now taken that road . in this case he would certainly pass the end of the passage towards which lord fawn declared that he had seen the man hurrying whom he now supposed to have been [male] finn . finn 's direct road home would .
she was persuaded that the sublime passion was the key to the enigma . but it was difficult to relate her conception of love to the forms it wore in her experience . two or three of the girls she had envied for their superior acquaintance with the arts of life had contracted . in the course of time , what were variously described as `` romantic '' or `` foolish '' marriages . one even made a runaway match , and languished for a while under a cloud of social reprobation .
the girl had dropped her axe , and was coming toward them . she was a slim , bird like creature , with a poise to her head and an up tilt to her chin which warned that the man had not yet beaten her to the level of the woman . she was dressed in a faded calico , frayed at the bottom . and with the sleeves bobbed off just above the elbows of her slim white arms . her stockings were mottled with patches and mends .
when she rose from her stool under a finished cow . angel clare , who had been observing her for some time . asked her if she would take the aforesaid creatures next , she silently assented . and with her stool at arm 's length . and the pail against her knee , went round to where they stood .
it did not enter my head to question his judgment . what he said had to be , was he not the samurai ? and yet , a few minutes later , when he had gone below , i noticed mr. [male] enter the chart house . after several paces up and down , and a brief pause to watch [male] and several men shift the weather cloth from [male] to weather . i strolled aft to the chart house , prompted by i know not what .
all he had to do was to cut it out by the very means which the yearly profits of his business would enable him to purchase . for the moment , he owed a great deal . without the shadow of a doubt mere industry would clear his debt . and leave him with substantial acquisitions created , practically , from nothing but his own abilities . the money obtained from his mortgages was a tool which he picked up an instant .
september 1st , the applebys had given up hope of miracles . they were making up their minds to notify mr. [male] . of [male] and son 's sixth avenue standard shoe parlor . that father again wanted the job he had held for so many years . they must leave the rose arbor for the noise of that most alien of places .
`` a man , but she was a widow , '' aunt [female] said vaguely ; and her niece could not help laughing . for if that were the case there might have been brothers or sons . but the cabman was getting very impatient , and it was not an easy matter to argue with him . for when they insisted that this could not be 14 ruesulpice , he merely shook his head and persisted that it was .
but to go with authority , and in his poor , maimed guise assert that right . he had need be other than [male] hepburn . so he stood in the old shelter of the steep . crooked lane opening on to the hill out of the market place . and watched the soft fading of the summer 's eve into night .
she did go to bed , and mrs. [female] explained to the two ladies as much as was necessary of what had occurred . when mrs. [female] came to understand that the gentleman who had been closeted with her would . probably , in a few months be a lord himself . that he was a very rich man , a member of parliament . and one of those who are decidedly born with gold spoons in their mouths , and understood also that [male] rowley had refused him .
it was no longer a man gazing at a man . it was no longer an enemy surveying an enemy . it was a dog scanning a thief . the reader knows the rest , marius pursued his senseless course . one day he followed cosette to the rue [male] l'ouest .
`` let him come here , and she shall be here also , '' said the earl . speaking of violet , to this [male] could say nothing out loud . but he told himself that all should be fair between them . he would take no dishonest advantage of lord [male] . he would give lord [male] the whole message as it was given to him by lord brentford .
the corners of his mouth smiled mechanically , another room . the same breathing , enlivened by one ghastly snort that sent his heart again on its tour of his breast . round object -- watch ; chain . roll of bills ; stick pins ; two rings . he remembered that he had got rings from the other bureau .
the gate stood ajar -- strange , for i had seen the custodian close it that evening . now it stood wide and i went in , walking noiselessly over the dewy grass . i knew and could not tell how , that i must be noiseless , passing as if i were guided . down the course of the strong young river , i came to the pavilion that spanned it . the place where we had stood that afternoon .
not in a glass carriage , you may be sure . the market is a good two hours journey from our hut . and the direction is marked by the church tower . the peasant women , when they pack with wares the baskets which they put on their heads . make , first of all , a sort of wreath of rags .
lydgate , by betting on his own strokes , had won sixteen pounds . but young [male] 's arrival had changed the poise of things . he made first rate strokes himself . and began to bet against [male] 's strokes , the strain of whose nerves was thus changed from simple confidence in his own movements to defying another person 's doubt in them . the defiance was more exciting than the confidence , but it was less sure .
loder sat very still , overwhelming possibilities had suddenly opened before him . in a moment the unreality of the past months had become real . a tangible justification of himself and his imposture was suddenly made possible . in the stress of understanding he , too , leaned forward , and , resting his elbows on the desk . took his face between his hands , for a space lakely made no remark .
he got up and made various [organization] , the elaborate meal . complex with fifty dainties each of which had to be savoured , was not nearly over . the parson stopped in his course up the room to speak with mrs. [female] . after he had shaken hands with her . he caught the admired violet eyes of his slim wife .
with this parting shot at [female] , [female] flung into the house . thinking she had given [female] a dressing that she would never forget . [female] was radiant , such abuse was honey on her lips . such scoldings were joy bells in her ears . she took silent delight in provoking these attacks .
other household pets appeared in due course of time . including a collie , that [female] named rats . she had brought him from [location] as a puppy . and he had grown to be a sterling watch dog , sensible and affectionate , there was also a cat . [male] , so called after a boy [male] knew .
she dramatized her explanation so vividly that darrow felt as if his point were gained . `` ah , but this confirms your vocation -- of course , '' he cried . `` you must see cerdine , '' and , seeing her face fall at this reminder of the change in her prospects . he hastened to set forth his plan , as he did so . he saw how easy it was to explain things to her .
a moment later , a certain old [male] emerged from [organization] . where he had been buying books , looking across the road . he saw , to his amazement , great beads of perspiration glistening on the brows of those emperors . he trembled , and hurried away , that evening , in common room , he told what he had seen . and no amount of polite scepticism would convince him that it was but the hallucination of one who had been reading too much mommsen .
`` is her name ursula ? '' and i called to mind the little girl who had tried to give some bread to the hungry [female] halifax . and whose cry of pain we heard as the door shut upon her . poor little lady , how sorry i was , i knew [male] would be so infinitely sorry too . and all to no purpose -- that i determined not to tell him anything about it . the next time i saw [male] i asked him after the child .
chapter xi , of a great tourney made by king [male] and the two kings ban and [male] . and how they went over the sea , and king [male] and the two kings let depart the seven hundred knights in two parties . and there were three hundred knights of the realm of benwick and of gaul turned on the other side . then they dressed their shields , and began to couch their spears many good knights . so griflet was the first that met with a knight .
after one the crowd of men became rather more indifferent , and clustered together in broad spots . eating their lunch , smoking cigars , and chaffing each other , it was singular to observe the amazing quantity of ham sandwiches and of sherry that had been carried into [male] on that day . grooms appeared to have been laden with cases , and men were as well armed with flasks at their saddle bows as they used to be with pistols . [male] and pollock formed the centre of one of these crowds . and chaffed each other with the utmost industry , till , tired of having inflicted no wounds .
did you notice ? you did not ? eh ? well i am perhaps a little mad on that point . when i pass one of these places i must avert my eyes , i could not have gone to meet [male] barral . i should have shrunk from the ordeal . you will notice that it looks as if [male] had shirked it too . little fyne 's flight of fancy picturing three people in the fatal four wheeler , you remember ?
she had cobbled them a little during the later period of her married life . during the time of her endeavour to be good , -- but she had not finished this work or any other . ah , what a poor creature she was , after all ! a creature of feeble resolutions , formed only to be broken ; a weak vacillating creature . full of misty yearnings and aspirings -- resolving nobly in one moment .
in fact , precisely at this transitional point of its nightly roll into darkness the great and particular glory of the egdon waste began . and nobody could be said to understand the heath who had not been there at such a time . it could best be felt when it could not clearly be seen , its complete effect and explanation lying in this and the succeeding hours before the next dawn . then , and only then , did it tell its true tale , the spot was . indeed , a near relation of night , and when night showed itself an apparent tendency to gravitate together could be perceived in its shades and the scene .
sue 's was of the most artless and natural kind , she addressed him as her dear [female] jude . said she had only just learnt by the merest accident that he was living in christminster . and reproached him with not letting her know , they might have had such nice times together . she said , for she was thrown much upon herself . and had hardly any congenial friend , but now there was every probability of her soon going away .
the plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing . to study the skillful tactics and aims of [male] and his army from the time it entered [location] till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps and shudders of a mortally wounded animal . very often a wounded animal , hearing a rustle , rushes straight at the hunter 's gun . runs forward and back again , and hastens its own end , [male] , under pressure from his whole army . did the same thing , the rustle of the battle of tarutino frightened the beast .
no one should ever go near [organization] who wishes to enjoy all this , it was so manifestly evident that neither jove nor any of his satellites cared twopence for what the irate gentleman was saying . nay , it became so evident that , in spite of his assumed fury . the gentleman was not irate , he intended to communicate his look of anger to the newspaper reports of his speech . and he knew from experience that he could succeed in that . and men walked about the house in the most telling moments .
mr. [male] did not trouble himself to listen to the conversation of these men . he looked into the room for a few minutes and then returned to the bar . where he ordered a glass of brandy and water from the girl who served mr. [female] 's customers in the absence of that gentleman . `` so your master is away from home , my lass , '' he said , in his most insinuating tone , as he slowly stirred his brandy and water .
i think that you have got it into your mind that i have befriended mr. [male] 's suit . and that , having received this impression , you hold it with the tenacity which is usual to you . there never was a greater mistake , i went to matching as the friend of my dear friend . but i stayed there at your request , as your friend , had i been . when you asked me to do so , a participator in that secret i could not have honestly remained in the position you assigned to me .
pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in couples out of the circle . all but one rejoined their companies , this one , a young soldier , his face deadly pale . his shako pushed back , and his musket resting on the ground . still stood near the pit at the spot from which he had fired . he swayed like a drunken man , taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling .
as regarded yosef mealyus the story now told respecting him was this . he was already in custody , he had been found in bed at his lodgings between seven and eight . and had , of course , given himself up without difficulty . he had seemed to be horror struck when he heard of the man 's death . but had openly expressed his joy , he has endeavoured to ruin me .
nothing was now left but arranging the general orders , and [male] gave them with precision . he enjoined his men to be ready to set out for the hague . some following the coast which leads to breskens , others the road to antwerp . the rendezvous was given , by calculating each day 's march . a fortnight from that time , upon the chief place at the hague .
as he paused at the little green gate let in the rough stone wall . the door opened and the princess came smilingly down the path to meet him . she walked with the springy step of youth and health . and held out her hand with an engaging frankness , a little below the medium height . the princess made up in dignity what she lacked in inches .
porthos and [female] placed themselves at the table and began to play . [female] walked about in a contemplative mood , while thinking and walking , [male] passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove . broken in halves , the other extremity passing into the chamber above . and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words . which at length fixed his attention , [male] went close to it .
for a moment archer stood with his eyes fixed on [male] 's fantastic figure . straining to see who came behind her ; but the little procession was at an end . for all the lesser members of the family had taken their seats . and the eight tall ushers , gathering themselves together like birds or insects preparing for some migratory manoeuvre . were already slipping through the side doors into the lobby .
his eyes shot open , it was [female] . with her head nestled in the crook of his arm as she knelt there beside him on the floor . he could see only a bit of her face . but her hair was very near , crumpled gloriously on his breast , and he could see the tips of her long lashes as she remained very still . seeming not to breathe , she did not know he had roused from his sleep .
she was sent back , however , in a moment by the entrance of captain wentworth himself . among a party of gentlemen and ladies . evidently his acquaintance , and whom he must have joined a little below [male] street . he was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before . he looked quite red , for the first time , since their renewed acquaintance .
instantly others fell to fighting hand to hand , striking on targe and helm . but sir owen , sir [male] and sir [male] surrounded the king . and all hurried back to the army approaching them , so likewise did sir mordred . then came the crash of battle , as line on line . with flashing swords held high , the ranks of war closed .
that summer -- the summer cheri gave [female] folle two [female] curls tied with a knot of red ribbon . the water ran so low in the bayou that even the little children at bellissime were able to cross it on foot . and the cattle were sent to pasture down by the river , [female] folle was sorry when they were gone . for she loved these dumb companions well , and liked to feel that they were there . and to hear them browsing by night up to her own enclosure .
it was now his business to seek out the duke of gloucester . who alone , in the disorder of the forces , might be able to supply him with a sufficiency of men . the fighting in the main town was now practically at an end . and as [male] ran hither and thither , seeking the commander , the streets were thick with wandering soldiers . some laden with more booty than they could well stagger under , others shouting drunk .
waving this wand as he advanced towards [male] . he cleared a semi circular space before her chair . thrice with the most profound reverence bowed to her , thrice . turned himself around with sundry grimaces . and then fiercely planted himself at her side , [male] was amused by his mummery . but felt no great delight in his guardianship , and , after a short time .
in the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the spot chosen by [male] . with the guns of pernetti and fouche . which were to come in line with them , 102 guns in all . were to open fire and shower shells on the russian fleches and redoubts . this could not be done , as from the spots selected by [male] the projectiles did not carry to the russian works .
at grey of night , when the sun was gone . and no red in the west remained , neither were stars forthcoming , suddenly a wailing voice rose along the valleys . and a sound in the air , as of people running . it mattered not whether you stood on the moor . or crouched behind rocks away from it , or down among reedy places .
this partly consoled her for missing so much of what made their good time ', . but the resulting sense of exclusion , of being somehow laughingly but firmly debarred from a share of their privileges . threw her back on herself and deepened the reserve which made envious mothers cite her as a model of ladylike repression . love , she told herself . would one day release her from this spell of unreality .
the very young man stood transfixed , it was a sheer drop of forty feet or more to the gully floor beneath him . there was seemingly nothing that he could do in those few terrible seconds . and yet with subconscious , instinctive reasoning , he did the one and only thing possible . a loose mass of the jagged , gold quartz hung over the gully wall . frantically he tore at it -- pried loose with feet and hands a bowlder that hung poised .
he leaned into the darkness , watching the greater darkness of [location] below him . the chambers stood much higher than the other houses , commanding a hundred chimneys . crooked cowls that looked like sitting cats as they swung round . and other uncouth brick and zinc mysteries supported by iron stanchions and clamped by 8 pieces . northward the lights of piccadilly circus and leicester square threw a copper coloured glare above the [male] roofs .
next day , when we were all assembled round the breakfast table , shivering and fresh from the morning 's chill ablutions . mrs. [female] pronounced a decree that nobody . who was not forced by dire necessity , should quit her house that day . indeed , egress seemed next to impossible ; the drift darkened the lower panes of the casement . and , on looking out , one saw the sky and air vexed and dim .
the passing of mrs. stanhope made it possible for me to put into operation the long desired plan of retiring a little way into the country . not too far from the seductions of the club and the city . but far enough to conform to the tastes of a country gentleman who likes to whistle to his dogs . putter over his roses , and meditate in a comfortable library with the poets and philosophers of his fancy . here , with my good house keeper , prudence -- a name i chose in preference to her mother 's selection .
this new comer was a tall pale faced young man , with intensely penetrating [male] eyes exactly like his mother 's . sharp well cut features , and an extreme precision of dress and manner . his hands , which were small and thin , were remarkable for their whiteness , and were set off by spotless wristbands . which it was his habit to smooth fondly with his slim fingers in the intervals of his discourse . mrs. [male] rose and embraced this gentleman with stately affection .
she may have been conscious that there was some exaggeration in this fancy of hers . for she certainly did not wish to share it with [male] . to him , she supposed , [male] , composing leaflets for cabinet ministers among her typewriters . represented all that was interesting and genuine ; and , [female] , she shut them both out from all share in the crowded street . with its pendant necklace of lamps , its lighted windows .
as he meditated thus , dejected but resolute , hesitating in every direction . and , in short , shuddering at what he was about to do , his glance strayed to the interior of the barricade . the insurgents were here conversing in a low voice , without moving , and there was perceptible that quasi silence which marks the last stage of expectation . overhead , at the small window in the third story marius descried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly attentive . this was the porter who had been killed by le cabuc , below , by the lights of the torch .
nobody yearned to get up early ( i speak for others , as i passed my night in the attitude of a suspension bridge between two folding chairs ) , . but in camp where sleep is concerned , men may propose , camels dispose . their nights they spend in a ring of camelhood . huddled together for warmth ; and if they do not have nightmare or bite each other in their sleep . mere humans in neighbouring tents may hope for comparative silence in the desert .
i looked at the boy in sorrow . and as i looked i saw the cloud of a deep despondency settle upon his countenance . i followed the direction of his eye . and saw that a very old and white bearded man , clothed in a flowing [male] gown . had risen and was standing at the table upon unsteady legs , and feebly swaying his ancient head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye .
he felt very hot and slightly ridiculous as he tucked [male] into the little car . being very particular about her feet , and starting with extreme care , so as not to jar her . he had the feeling of being entrusted temporarily with something infinitely precious . and very , very dear , something that must never suffer or be hurt , on wednesday morning [male] was in an office in the city . he sat forward on the edge of his chair .
[male] sat down , very pale , and the man described the finding of the poor shattered body . as he finished , coventry appeared , and with one look of mingled remorse . shame , and sorrow , the elder brother went away . to find and bring the younger home , [female] crept into the garden like a guilty thing . trying to hide the satisfaction which struggled with a woman 's natural pity .
his head began to reel , he took the brandy bottle from the dressing table . poured out half a tumbler , and drained it at one draught . as he did so , his eyes above the rim of the glass rested on the portrait of his mother over the fireplace . the face as he saw it then was no longer the face of the winsome bride . it was the living face as he remembered it .
the sounds , which he had not heard for so long , had an even more pleasurable and exhilarating effect on rostov than the previous sounds of firing . drawing himself up , he viewed the field of battle opening out before him from the hill . and with his whole soul followed the movement of the uhlans . they swooped down close to the french dragoons , something confused happened there amid the smoke . and five minutes later our uhlans were galloping back , not to the place they had occupied but more to the left .
squirrels played on the tree trunks like mischievous children . the brooks sang like happy human voices through the tremulous underworld and woodpeckers hammered out the joy of spring . but the awakening only made the desolate cabin lonelier still , after three warm days in march . [male] , the [male] , rode up the creek with a hoe over his shoulder . he had promised this to [male] -- for his labour of love in june 's garden .
[female] hurtled into the hall and brought back her coat . fumbling in the pocket , mrs. [female] put on her spectacles and reached for the book . while [female] 's mother got up and came behind her mother 's chair to look over at the magic figures . [female] stooped for the little white note that had fluttered to her feet as she opened the book . but she had little interest to see what it said .
[female] politely , answering if necessary ; yet her interest was concentrated in peering through the slits in the wooden shutter of the nearest window . she did not know algiers well enough to recognize landmarks . but after driving for what seemed like fifteen or twenty minutes through streets where lights began to turn the twilight blue . she caught a glint of the sea . almost immediately the trotting mules stopped , and the negress hsina .
she sat some time in a good deal of agitation . listening , trembling , and fearing to be sent for every moment ; but as no footsteps approached the east room . she grew gradually composed , could sit down , and be able to employ herself . and able to hope that mr. [male] had come and would go without her being obliged to know anything of the matter . nearly half an hour had passed , and she was growing very comfortable , when suddenly the sound of a step in regular approach was heard .
he purposely directed his movements so that he would not come into contact with gregson . little dreaming that his artist friend was working under the same formula . he lunched with the factor , and a little later went boldly back to the cliff where he had met jeanne and [male] the preceding night . although he had now come to expect no response to what he had written . he carefully examined the rocks about him .
he is a good-looking young man , and seems to have a good deal to say for himself . i tell eloisa that she should set her cap at him . but she does not at all seem to relish the proposal , i should like to see the girl married and [female] has a very good estate . perhaps you may wonder that i do not consider myself as well as my sister in my matrimonial projects . but to tell you the truth i never wish to act a more principal part at a wedding than the superintending and directing the dinner .
after this there was something of recklessness and something of pleasantry in the young girl 's manner of making herself an example of the triumph of pride and common sense over memory and sentiment . her attitude had been epitomized in her defiant singing at the time she learnt that [female] was not leal and true . [female] , as was inevitable , came again almost immediately , drawn thither by the sun of her first smile on him . and the words which had accompanied it , and now instead of going off to her little pursuits upstairs . downstairs , across the room , in the corner .
however , mr. [male] consented to listen and teach for an hour together . like a schoolmaster of little boys , or rather like a lover . to whom a [female] 's elementary ignorance and difficulties have a touching fitness . few scholars would have disliked teaching the alphabet under such circumstances . but [female] herself was a little shocked and discouraged at her own stupidity .
the sword was turned away from them now , and if they could take him from behind . stun him with the chill force of the sceptre like rods they carried ... he slashed them with the sword . he saw the flickering beam go down and down the shaft . saw the bodies fall like drops of rain .
i went and called , but got no answer , on returning , i whispered to [male] that he had heard a good part of what she said . i was sure ; and told how i saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her brother 's conduct regarding him . she jumped up in a fine fright , flung hareton on to the settle . and ran to seek for her friend herself ; not taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried . or how her talk would have affected him , she was absent such a while that [male] proposed we should wait no longer .
when the morning came miss [organization] lost no time in setting out for kerrytown . where the money was soon safely deposited in the bank , she heaved a sigh of relief when she left the building . i feel as if i could enjoy life once more . she said to herself , goodness me , if i would had to keep that money by me for a week itself . i would have been a raving lunatic by the end of it , miss [organization] had shopping to do and friends to visit in town .
these words , with many jogs between them . came to me through the darkness , and then a long groan and a choking . i made towards the sound , as nigh as ever i could guess . and presently was met , point blank , by the head of a mountain pony , upon its back lay a man bound down . with his feet on the neck and his head to the tail .
anyway , there he was , sitting in the reception room very proper with his hat and stick and gloves beside him . and [male] and [male] with seventh hour recitations that they could not cut . so [male] dashed into my room and begged me to walk him about the campus and then deliver him to her when the seventh hour was over . i said i would , obligingly but unenthusiastically , because i do not care much for pendletons . but he turned out to be a sweet lamb , he 's a real human being .
a red shaft of sunlight tipped down on pete 's uncovered head from the top of the wall . the blessed tears had come to him , he was sobbing aloud . he was alone with his love at last , he was alone with her indeed . at that moment [female] was looking down from the window of her room . she saw him kneeling and praying by another 's grave .
at last he disappeared ; and the girl , turning , looked up , and there rode the white ghost of the moon overhead . she was alone , a great fear settled down upon the girl as she realized that she was alone and . for a few hours at least , free , it was a marvellous escape . even now she could hear the echo of the man 's last words . and see his hateful smile as he waved his good by and promised to come back for her tomorrow .
he was a young man whom you would hardly pass in a crowd without observing . but of whom you would say , after due observation , that he had not as yet put off all his childish ways . he now sat with his legs stretched out , with his cane in his hands . looking down upon the water , he was trying to think , he worked hard at thinking . but the bench was hard and , upon the whole , he was not satisfied with his position .
events might turn out anyhow , and men were hateful . yes , men were hateful , but in these last hours , a certain change had come over their meaning . it is one thing to hate stolen goods . and another thing to hate them the more because their being stolen hinders [female] from making use of them . [female] had begun to be angry with [female] for being what had hindered her from marrying him .
as a vast fire will fill the air to a great distance with its roar . so the sacred flame which the mighty barnacles had fanned caused the air to resound more and more with the name of [male] . it was deposited on every lip , and carried into every ear . there never was , there never had been , there never again should be , such a man as mr [male] . nobody , as aforesaid , knew what he had done .
[female] gave a violent start , fixed her eyes upon [female] . saw her turning pale , and fell back in her chair in hysterics . mrs. [female] , whose eyes . as she answered the servant 's inquiry . had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by [female] 's countenance how much she really suffered .
it was some damp upon their joyful congratulations when they learned from [male] the mode in which he had obtained this treasure . to which their own experience of the nocturnal vision induced them to give full credit . but they were unable to resist the temptation of sharing in their brother 's wealth . taking now upon him as head of the house . [male] bought lands and forests .
as soon as i had got the bundle , and the maid was out of sight . i goes on towards the alehouse . where the porter 's wife was , so that if i had met her . i had then only been going to give her the bundle , and to call her to her business . as if i was going away , and could stay no longer ; but as i did not meet her .
since that day she had strained over the brass railing of the car to hold him in her sight until the curtain of dust intervened . he had felt her call urging him into the west . the strength of her beckoning hand drawing him the way she had gone . to search the world for her and find her on some full and glorious day . was you aimin to sell [male] and go on the train , duke ?
he was no longer totus teres atque rotundus . the beauty of his life was over , and the contentment of his mind was gone . he knew that it was only left for him to die . spending such days as remained to him in vague prophecies of evil against his devoted country . a country which had allowed its ancient parochial landmarks to be moved , and its ecclesiastical fastnesses to be invaded !
`` want any more ? '' asked the old gentleman , looking grim and vexed . but trying not to show it , yes , please , i like old [male] so well . i think i will try the second volume , returned [male] . hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second dose of boswell 's [male] . as he had recommended that lively work , the shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the johnsonian literature was placed .
i have no doubt that hubert arundel felt the sting of his only sister 's neglect . as only a poor and proud man can feel such an insult ; but he never let any confession of this sentiment escape his lips . and when mrs. [female] , being seized with a fancy for doing this forgotten brother a service . wrote him a letter of insolent advice . winding up with an offer to procure his only child a situation as nursery governess .
the inquiries were addressed to miss [female] , who graciously replied that she would be beyond anything interested and enchanted . mrs [female] went to a door . looked in beyond it , and came back , `` do [female] the favour to come in , '' said she , `` i knew he would be pleased , '' the first object that confronted little [male] . entering first , was [male] of [location] in a great cloak and a furtive slouched hat .
he dressed swiftly , then he made his way to the window . looked out , and listened , in the brilliant starlight he saw nothing but the two white stubs of the lightning shattered trees in which the owls lived . and it was very still , the air was fresh and sweet in his face . in it he caught the scent of the distant balsams and cedars . the world , wonderful in its night silence .
`` yes , i am a stranger , '' she caught at the word . seized by an inward terror of the small eyes fixed curiously on her . she intuitively shrank from betraying her identity , and the old servant had told her what she needed to know . of course her husband was his lordship , ', over here . `` i am from [male] , and i would like to see the gallery , '' she must do so to give a pretext for having come to visit an empty house .
the right honourable gentleman had pledged himself with an almost sacred enthusiasm to ignore that subject altogether . no doubt it was the question before the house . and he , himself , -- the present speaker . must unfortunately discuss it at some length , the right honourable gentleman opposite would not . on this great occasion , trouble himself with anything of so little moment .
`` go on , go on , give it them , '' he mentally exclaimed at these sounds . and again proceeded to gallop along the line , penetrating farther and farther into the region where the army was already in action . after passing some austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the line was already in action . he was riding almost along the front line , a handful of men came galloping toward him . they were our uhlans who with disordered ranks were returning from the attack .
naturally , it was not very long before the attention of numerous other ladies was directed to mr. [male] barold . it was observed that he took no share in the festivities . that he did not regain his natural air of enviable indifference to his surroundings . that he did not approach octavia [organization] until all was over , and she was on the point of going home . what he said to her then , no one heard , `` good by , '' she answered .
but even madame [female] had not on this occasion the form she would have liked to have . the perfect self possession she would have wished to wear for her host . the point to be made is , however , that at a certain moment the element between them . whatever it was , always levelled itself and left them more closely face to face than either ever was with any one else . this was what had happened now , they stood there knowing each other well and each on the whole willing to accept the satisfaction of knowing as a compensation for the inconvenience .
[female] suspected that , and therefore turned the conversation [male] . [male] , on his part , was burning to give explanations . which [male] avoided , but , as certain tenacities are stronger than others . [male] was forced to hear [male] recite his idyls of felicity . translated into a language more chaste than that of longus .
she would have been a [female] russell . a mrs. [female] , a lady nithisdale . a madame [female] lavalette . she would have been great by reason of her power of self abnegation . and there would have been a strange charm in the aspect of this fierce nature attuned to harmonise with its master 's soul .
she almost laughed , and mrs. [organization] knew that she had spoken the truth . it looked , for a moment , as if she were going to be beaten on this point . for gabrielle snatched at her weakness , repeating the unanswerable `` you dare not ! '' then , suddenly , without any warning , the girl 's triumphant spirit collapsed . from the verge of laughter she toppled over into tears .
the presence of [female] made the only change in the old house . and even that change was a very trifling one , [female] and her father were as closely united at [female] towers as they had been in oakley street . the little girl clung to her father as tenderly as ever . more tenderly than ever perhaps ; for she knew something of that which the physicians had said . and she knew that [female] 's lease of life was not a long one .
miss granger would gladly have delegated this office to a servant . but her father 's word was law . so she led the way to a suite of apartments which [male] had ordered to be prepared for his young wife . and which clarissa had not yet been allowed to see , they had been kept as a [female] surprise for her coming home . had she been a princess of the blood royal .
she looked at him hopelessly , he could not see . he could not understand , and how could she tell him ? her father 's words rang in her brain . he was `` crooked , '' he was `` here on some game . '' he was being watched , but she loved him .
`` be careful , sir , be very careful , '' he knew that this was what lawyers always said . of course , there is a difference in position between a miscreant whom you suspect of an attempt at perjury and the father of the girl you love . whose consent to the match you wish to obtain . but [male] was in no mood for these nice distinctions . he only knew that lawyers told people to be very careful .
all this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him , and as it seemed to them to be uttered close by . as indeed it was , they got up to look for the speaker . and before they had gone twenty paces they discovered behind a rock . seated at the foot of an ash tree . a youth in the dress of a peasant .
because of their depleted state , they spend the night at southampton in happy frame . and make inquiries whether the king is in england . they are told that he is at winchester . and that they can reach there in a very short time if they will start early in the morning and keep to the straight road . at this news they are greatly pleased , and the next morning at daybreak the youths wake early .
young -- lonely -- blind , i had a sudden inspiration , i felt i should love her . the question of my musical capacity was , in this sad case . a serious one , the poor young lady had one great pleasure to illumine her dark life , music . her companion was wanted to play from the book , and play worthily , the works of the great masters . and she , listening , would take her place next at the piano .
they were still discussing the subject , when a loud shouting was heard . and they all ran to a disused bedroom in the front of the house and looked out . a crowd of men , marching in fours . were coming up the street , led by one beating a drum , and another carrying a dirty banner with liberte , equalite , fraternite ', upon it . [female] 's eyes sparkled with excitement .
i kept the spray going almost constantly until the physician came . it was the only way i could breathe . [male] must have made a record journey . for the door bell signalled his arrival only a few moments after mother [male] 's message . he gave my throat one swift .
but on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present . consisting of an entirely new fishing boat , with two seines and a tender . the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor . but they had seen him , upon quitting the hut . merely give some orders to a sailor , and then springing lightly on horseback .
a storm is awfully disturbing in the country , you are always having to think of so many things that are out of doors and getting spoiled , daddy , daddy ! what do you think ? the postman has just come with two letters , 2nd . a letter from the college secretary . i am to have a scholarship for two years that will cover board and tuition . it was founded for `` marked proficiency in english with general excellency in other lines . ''
the king was not mistaken , [male] and his friends . again mingling with the throng , were taking a last look at the martyr king . when the soldier saluted [male] , [male] 's heart bounded for joy . and that unfortunate , on coming to himself , found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket . but when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch [male] grasped his dagger .
phineas sent his card up by a servant . and in a few minutes was standing with his hand on the lock of lord [male] 's door . the last time he had seen this man . they had met with pistols in their hands to shoot at each other . and lord [male] had in truth done his very best to shoot his opponent .
some days are like tin nutmeg graters that everybody uses to grate you against . and this was one for me , for an hour i sat and grated my own self against [male] 's letter that had come in the morning . i realised that i would just have to come to some sort of decision about what i was going to do . for he wrote that he was coming in a week or two . i like him and always have , of that i am sure .
beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit . and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf , but he had been unable to send to [male] the following particulars . as the events had transpired after the messenger 's departure . namely , that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly . every one had arrived almost before the usual hour , and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues .
it gives [male] its maiden charm . before , settling into the married summer , which , again , does not so soon sober itself into matronly autumn . in our own country , the virgin spring hastens to its bridal too abruptly . but here , after a month or two of kindly growth , the leaves of the young trees . which cover that portion of the borghese grounds nearest the city wall .
the moments glided on , while a feeling of good fellowship passed around the circle like a mystic cord . holding and binding these people together with jest and laughter . [male] ratignolle was the first to break the [male] charm . at ten o'clock he excused himself . madame ratignolle was waiting for him at home .
westward , the wiry boughs of the bare thorn hedge which formed the boundary of the field rose against the pale opalescence of the lower sky . above , [location] hung like a full blown jonquil . so bright as almost to throw a shade , a few small nondescript stars were appearing elsewhere . in the distance a dog barked , and wheels occasionally rattled along the dry road . nobody looked at his or her companions , the eyes of all were on the soil as its turned surface was revealed by the fires .
the noon train to [location] carried in its drawing room car madam [female] . her granddaughter , her maid . and her dog , bound for [location] . the society columns so stated ; and so read grandmother brady a few days afterward . so also read [male] benedict , but it meant nothing to him .
`` i am sure it will , '' said [female] . looking at the two , who had risen and stood together in the evening sunlight . examining their rackets and discussing possible tactics , while awaiting their opponents . they made such a radiantly beautiful couple ; it was as if nature had put her very best and loveliest into every detail of each . the only fault which could possibly have been found with the idea of them wedded .
lieutenants are crowned kings ; superintendents improvise manufacturers out of themselves . envious rivalries arose , [male] vast workshops were shut . his buildings fell to ruin , his workmen were scattered , some of them quitted the country . others abandoned the trade , thenceforth , everything was done on a small scale . instead of on a grand scale ; for lucre instead of the general good .
the result was , he found humanity very much alike everywhere . and to a mind like his , curious and cold , the savage was duller . less exciting than the european , so he took hold of all kinds of sociological ideas . and ideas of reform , but they never went more than skin deep . they were never more than a mental amusement , their interest lay chiefly in the reaction against the positive order .
he wanted to shout , to let her know what he had meant to say at fort o ', god . but his voice would have been like a whisper in a hurricane . could jeanne understand ? the wall of foam was almost in their faces , suddenly he bent down . crushed his face to hers , and kissed her again and again , then , as the maelstrom engulfed them . he swung his own body to take the brunt of the shock .
he liked old rouault , who pressed his hand and called him his saviour . he like the small wooden shoes of mademoiselle emma on the scoured flags of the kitchen . her high heels made her a little taller . and when she walked in front of him . the wooden soles springing up quickly struck with a sharp sound against the leather of her boots .
`` indeed , '' answered [male] , `` i have not forgotten it . '' he looked pleased by this remembrance , and added , he could say no more . and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room , [male] , affected by his relation . and still more by his distress , could not speak , he saw her concern . and coming to her , took her hand , pressed it , and kissed it with grateful respect .
[male] had never seen a more easy , graceful , daring figure on horseback . and in the bright light he could make out the reckless face of the man who had been the first to flash his pistol in town that day . bad rufe tolliver , for ten minutes the two talked in whispers . rufe bent forward with one elbow on the withers of his horse but lifting his eyes every now and then to the stranger seated in the porch . and then the horseman turned with an oath and galloped into the darkness whence he came .
instead of using a carriage she now drove about in a donkey chair . the said boy walking in front to clear the way and keep the animal in motion . while she wore , so his informants reported , not an ordinary widow 's cap or bonnet . but something even plainer , the [female] material being drawn tightly round her face . giving her features a small , demure , devout cast .
at the moment , there were in the house , on the first story . two travelers either preparing for supper , or at supper itself . [male] had seen their nags in the stable , and their equipages in the salle . one traveled with a lackey , undoubtedly a person of consideration . two perche mares , sleek , sound beasts .
`` yes , i should like a drink , '' said [male] . but without appearing to attend much , mr [male] got out his bottle , and fetched his jug full of water . and administered a potation , then , he shook the coverlet of his bed and spread it smooth . and [male] stretched himself upon it in the clothes he wore . mr [male] poetically remarking that he would pick the bones of his night 's rest .
`` you can -- help , '' said jeanne , she gave him her hand and made an effort to rise . instantly she sank back with a sob of pain . it was strange that her pain should fill him with a wonderful joy . he knew that she was suffering , that she could not walk or stand alone . and yet , back at the camp , she had risen in her torture and had come to his rescue .
she said , with her old smooth insolence , `` but this girl here '' she indicated katherine -- took care of me before she knew who i was . she just about saved my life and reason . too , when there was nobody else to care a whit whether i lived or died . even my sister 's gone back on me , so when i saw how much it meant to her to find out the truth about your precious husband .
she patted them down in front of all four wheels . her crisp hands looked like the paws of a three year old boy making a mud fort . her nails hurt from the mud wedged beneath them . her mud caked shoes were heavy to lift , it was with exquisite self approval that she sat on the running board . scraped a car load of lignite off her soles , climbed back into the car .
it took time before the stern nature of mr. [male] was compelled to the recognition of this secret of comfort . and that same sternness prevented his reaping any benefit in public estimation from the actions he performed . for the character is more easily changed than the habits and manners originally formed by that character . and to his dying day mr. [male] was considered hard and cold by those who only casually saw him or superficially knew him . but those who were admitted into his confidence were aware , that the wish that lay nearest to his heart was that none might suffer from the cause from which he had suffered .
[female] did not speak again till her hand was on the lock of the study door . here she turned round and said , take care papa does not come down . mr. [male] is with him now , the inspector was almost daunted by the haughtiness of her manner as she entered . there was something of indignation expressed in her countenance . but so kept down and controlled , that it gave her a superb air of disdain .
these americans were strange , an [female] girl would cross the seas . and come here alone with him -- a man and human , and she would take for granted that he would do what he was doing for love of his kind . which was partly true ; and she would be beautiful and sweet and amiable and quite unself conscious . and then she would go back home , warm of heart with gratitude . and marry the man of the picture , the village had but one street .
fair hands would not have turned back had there been six more , and he rushed into the water . one of the two encountered with him in the midst of the stream . and both spears were broken , then they drew their swords and smote eagerly at one another . at the last sir fair hands smote the other upon the helm so that he fell down stunned in the water . and there was he drowned , then sir fair hands spurred his horse upon the land .
`` i can not dispute you , '' answered pullen . and then they separated , `` do you know , [female] , '' said [female] , a week later , as once more the two lounged beside their camp fire . that i have the hardest kind of a task to keep myself from believing in omens . and especially the `` three warnings '' business ? now , to illustrate , we lost a man out of our company two nights ago .
but i could say no more , the charm of her own personality had touched everything and left its fragrance like a flower . breath in the air , i was beggared of thanks . but my whole soul was gratitude , we dined on the bank that evening . the lamp burning steadily in the still air and throwing broken reflections in the water . while the moon looked in upon them through the leaves .
nobody could have been more sorry than me that your lordship dropped your money . would not i have been prouder than anything to have a horse in my name win the race ! was it likely i should lame him ? anyways i did not , and i do not think your lordship thinks it was me . of course your lordship and me is two now .
but both torrents and navigable rivers are liable to a common fate . they may fall over precipices , and when this comes to pass even the latter cease to be navigable for a space . now this catastrophe was about to overtake our friend the colonel . well , [male] had dined , and had enjoyed a [male] as well as a good dinner . the squire , who of late had been cheerful as a cricket , was in his best form .
he was a small slight man , smaller than his uncle . but in face very like him , he had the same eyes . and nose , and chin , and the same mouth ; but his forehead was better . less high and pointed , and better formed about the brows , and then he wore moustaches . which somewhat hid the thinness of his mouth , on the whole .
lady [female] , when her young lover left her . was for a time freed from the necessity of thinking about him by her father . he had returned from the oaks in a very bad humour . lord [male] had been very badly treated by his son . whom he hated worse than any one else in the world , on the derby day he had won a large sum of money .
[female] made no reply , she could not help understanding what [female] meant . and she flushed , with honest anger , from brow to chin . but , while her dark blue eyes flamed with indignation , her anger was not such as to render her face less [female] to look upon . there are as many kinds of anger as there are of the sunsets with which they ought to end . [female] 's anger had no hate in it .
[male] his moustache and got up too , he was in for it now . absurd , fantastic situation , well , whatever happened he could only drift . drift , and look like an ass to lady caroline . the most absolute as well as deceitful ass -- an ass who was also a reptile . for she might well think he had been mocking her out in the garden when he said .
her eagerness , her impatience . her longings to be with them , were such as to bring a line or two of cowper 's tirocinium for ever before her . `` with what intense desire she wants her home , '' was continually on her tongue , as the truest description of a yearning which she could not suppose any schoolboy 's bosom to feel more keenly . when she had been coming to portsmouth , she had loved to call it her home .
[female] put thumb and forefinger to the wrist and counted the pulse . in the midst of it the kanaka roused . he awoke as gently as he slept , there was no movement of the body whatever . the eyes , only , moved , they flashed wide open , big and [male] . and stared , unblinking , into our faces , [male] put his finger to his lips as a sign for silence .
it was not one bruise , but four slender . purple marks , such as might have been made by the four fingers of a powerful hand . that had grasped the delicate wrist a shade too roughly , a narrow ribbon . bound tightly , might have left some such marks , it is true . and my lady protested once more that , to the best of her recollection , that must have been how they were made .
but , before venturing to make the revelation , dubious tess indirectly sounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon mr clare . by asking the former if mr clare had any great respect for old county families when they had lost all their money and land . the season developed and matured , another year 's instalment of flowers . leaves , nightingales , thrushes , finches . and such ephemeral creatures , took up their positions where only a year ago others had stood in their place when these were nothing more than germs and inorganic particles .
so it was decided , veslovsky and tushkevitch went off to the bathing place . promising to get the boat ready and to wait there for them , they walked along the path in two couples . [female] with sviazhsky , and [female] with vronsky . [female] was a little embarrassed and anxious in the new surroundings in which she found herself . abstractly , theoretically , she did not merely justify , she positively approved of [female] 's conduct .
he demanded that , since she had so outrageously accepted it without consulting him . she should write and cancel her acceptance , finding himself up against an unsuspected . shocking rock of obstinacy in her , he then declined to believe she had been invited to [location] at all . he declined to believe in this mrs. [male] . of whom till that moment he had never heard .
some hours later , when all was done that had to be , and his mother was lying down . he saw his father alone , on the bed . covered with a white sheet , he stood for a long time gazing at that face which had never looked angry . always whimsical , and kind , to be kind and keep your end up . there 's nothing else in it , he had once heard his father say .
his high and wrinkled forehead , and long grey hair and beard . would have been considered as handsome , had they not been the marks of a physiognomy peculiar to a race . which , during those dark ages , was alike detested by the credulous and prejudiced vulgar . and persecuted by the greedy and rapacious nobility , and who , perhaps , owing to that very hatred and persecution . had adopted a national character , in which there was much , to say the least .
mr. [male] , having finished his business with the key . at once began with the bludgeon , the bludgeon was produced , and was handed up to the bench . and inspected by the chief justice , the instrument excited great interest . men rose on tiptoe to look at it even from a distance . and the prime minister was envied because for a moment it was placed in his hands .
in such a town as barchester you may find the old waiter with the dirty towel in the head inn . or in the second class inn , and so you may the dapper waiter . or you may find both in each , and not know which is senior waiter and which junior waiter . but for service i always prefer the old waiter with the dirty towel . and i find it more easy to satisfy him in the matter of sixpences when my relations with the inn come to an end .
his brain was working swiftly , there was possibly one chance in ten that the [location] . rudderless and without human guidance -- would sweep safely between the [male] walls and jagged teeth of the chute . even if the [location] made this passage , they would be in the power of the police . unless some splendid whimsicality of fate sent it ashore before the launch came through . on the other hand , if it was carried far enough through the lower rapids .
a shallow box , this secret space contained one thing only . but that one of considerable value , being the leather bill fold in which the adventurer kept a store of ready money against emergencies . it was mostly for this , indeed , that he had come to his apartment . his [location] campaign having demanded an expenditure far beyond his calculations . so that he had landed in [location] with less than one hundred francs in pocket .
a dramatist wished to convert his book into a play ... several magazines wanted to know when his next story would be complete ... two or three clipping bureaus wished to supply him with the comments of the press ... many of the missives bore the marks of much forwarding . some had followed him half way around the world . then at the bottom of the pile he found a small but thickly filled envelope .
afterwards , he had lived fourteen months with the widow . whose feet in bed were cold as icicles . but now he had for life this beautiful woman whom he adored . for him the universe did not extend beyond the circumference of her petticoat . and he reproached himself with not loving her .
it was all there ; the enormous clark fortune inherited by a boy who had gone mad about this same beverly carlysle . her marriage to her leading man , [male] ; the subsequent killing of [male] by clark at his wyoming ranch . and clark 's escape into the mountains . the sensational details of clark 's infatuation . the drama of a crime and clark 's subsequent escape .
ivar led alexandra and emil to his little cave house . he had but one room , neatly plastered and whitewashed , and there was a wooden floor . there was a kitchen stove , a table covered with oilcloth . two chairs , a clock , a calendar . a few books on the window shelf ; nothing more .
i made the story of my grandfather glenarm 's legacy as brief as possible . for brevity was a definite law of our intercourse . i must have started slightly at espying suddenly [female] pickering not twenty feet away . a party of half a dozen or more had risen , and pickering and a girl were detached from the others for a moment . she was young , —quite the youngest in the group about pickering 's table .
as he rode through the land , he saw how it seemed that a dire pestilence had swept over it . for where he had seen the golden corn waving in miles of smiling fields . he saw it now blackened along the ground . the trees were stripped of their leaves and fruit . the cattle lay dead in the meads , and the fish rotted in the streams .
so softly and silently and surely the shadow crept and crept . until when june brought roses and [female] . ester received her in her own room , propped up among the pillows in her bed . gradually they grew accustomed to that also , as god in his infinite mercy has planned that human hearts shall grow used to the inevitable . they even told each other hopefully that the warm weather was what depressed her so much .
mrs. [female] shuts the door . and eliza 's plaints are no longer audible , pickering comes from the hearth to the chair and sits astride it with his arms on the back , pickering . excuse the straight question , [male] , are you a man of good character where women are concerned ? mrs. [female] opens the door . she has eliza 's hat in her hand .
[male] sat , reading hard -- his shoulders up to his ears . and his fingers stuck through his hair , developing the whole of his broad . knobbed , knotted forehead , where , maud declared , the wrinkles had already begun to show . for [female] maud herself . she flitted about in all directions , interrupting everything .
what mattered it to her that he was nameless , a wanderer , a slaver ? she loved him , and that covered each and all faults . however heinous in the sight of the law , she felt that it was not the outward associations which made a man . she had looked beneath the surface of his soul . and had seen the pure crystal depth of his manly heart -- [female] , open .
the suspense of the little household in overcombe mill was great in the extreme . [female] came thither daily for more than a week ; but no further particulars reached england till the end of that time . and then only the meagre intelligence that there had been a gale immediately after the battle . and that many of the prizes had been lost , [female] said little to all these things . and preserved a superstratum of calmness on her countenance .
i do not see why she sent another girl . are you sure you will understand the directions ? they are very particular , for i want my frock ready for to night without fail . the woman sat up , leaning on one elbow , her lace nightgown and pale blue silk dressing sack fell away from a round white arm that did not look as if it belonged to a very old lady . her gray hair was becomingly arranged , and she was extremely pretty , with small features .
afterwards the minister gave out another hymn . and as soon as the singing commenced [female] slipped away , once in the yard . she breathed a sigh of relief . [female] at the prayer meeting ? it was like coming out of prison . [female] was farther off than ever , nay , she had actually forgotten her soul in the sensations of shame and discomfort .
it was at this moment that leach and [female] looked up into the faces of their shipmates . who lined the rail amidships , there was no greeting . they were as dead men in their comrades eyes , and between them was the gulf that parts the living and the dead . the next instant they were opposite the poop .
he pushed back his chair and went to the window . `` it is hot in here , '' he said , `` do you mind ? '' and without waiting for an answer he loosed the catch and raised the sash . for some little while he stood by the open window , silent , undecided . durrance plainly did not know of the fourth feather broken off from ethne 's fan .
it was at this moment that [female] opened her eyes . `` where am i ? '' she weakly raised herself on one elbow . and the suspension of the duke 's hatred would have been repealed simultaneously with that of her consciousness . had it not already been repealed by the analogy , she put a hand to her face . then looked at the wet palm wonderingly , looked at the duke , saw the water jug beside him .
we could not find in our hearts to stir the next day . for , in short , having been [female] by the bells in the morning . and having perhaps not slept overmuch before , we were so sleepy afterwards that we lay in bed till almost twelve o'clock . i begged my landlady that we might not have any more music in the town . nor ringing of bells , and she managed it so well that we were very quiet .
the students and the nurses were behind her . she knew they were eating sweets . for she heard a young man ask the young women if they would have any more fondants . their chatter and laughter jarred on her nerves . but at that moment her pains began again and she saw the young man whom she had seen handing the sweets approaching her bedside .
[female] enough , in one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from willoughby . full of tenderness and contrition , explanatory of all that had passed . satisfactory , convincing ; and instantly followed by willoughby himself . rushing eagerly into the room to inforce , at her feet , by the eloquence of his eyes . the assurances of his letter , the work of one moment was destroyed by the next .
i am sure there was no evil in either of them . boyd [male] or [male] , they were rather another mildred and mertoun . caught in the grip of circumstance and whirled asunder . by one of those ironical tricks which fate sometimes loves to play , for , on the night of the elopement . while boyd [male] , leaving [location] on the eve of his christmas vacation .
while the six dined , a seventh , invisible to them , leaned moodily against the mantel piece , watching them . he was not of their time , his long brown hair was knotted in a [male] riband behind . he wore a pale brocaded coat and lace ruffles . silken stockings , a sword , privy to their doom . he watched them , he was loth that his junta must die .
armitage was uncomfortable , and anxious to allay her fears , the incident was by no means trivial . as he knew , passengers on the great transatlantic steamers are safeguarded by every possible means . and the fact that he had been attacked in the few minutes that the deck lights had been out of order pointed to an espionage that was both close and daring . he was greatly surprised and more shaken than he wished [female] to believe . the thing was disquieting enough , and it could not but impress her strangely that he .
mr. [male] walked away from the mate and when at some distance said , damn ! ', quite heartily . it was a confounded nuisance , it had ceased to be funny . that hostile word jailer had given the situation an air of reality , no , no ! how can i ? mr. [male] got quite agitated , for him . which did not amount to much , he was just asking for the sake of something to talk about .
in addition to the philological origins just indicated , [female] possesses other and still more natural roots . which spring , so to speak , from the mind of man itself . in the first place , the direct creation of words . therein lies the mystery of tongues . to paint with words , which contains figures one knows not how or why , is the primitive foundation of all human languages .
touching their hats was an unknown gesture in those parts . but they would move their heads in a droll . familiar kind of way , neither a wag nor a nod . but meant all the same to imply friendly regard , the ship owners , too , invited him to an occasional dinner or supper . all the time looking forward to the chances of his turning out an active enemy .
as he lay in bed , knowing that an hour remained to him before he need encounter the perils of his tub . he felt that he hated courcy castle and its inmates . who was there , among them all , that was comparable to mrs [female] and her daughters ? he detested both [male] and [male] . he loathed the earl , as to the countess herself .
granting and conforming to the charter , bonaparte places a postilion on the throne of naples . and a sergeant on the throne of sweden . employing inequality to demonstrate equality ; [male] . at saint ouen countersigns the declaration of the rights of man . if you wish to gain an idea of what revolution is . call it progress ; and if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress .
this was the report which [male] gave of his fellow guests . and he left the shooting party morning after morning to go out boating with [male] and [male] . or to idle away the sunny hours on the lawn listening to the talk of the two others . and dropping in a word now and then in a sleepy way as he lay stretched on the grass near them . looking up to the sky , with his arms crossed above his head .
but the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims . they need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken . and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to the [male] that was fattened . even if they do not know for what purpose they are fattened . they will at least know that all that happened to the [male] did not happen accidentally .
there was nothing now but the brown earth under the white thorn . yet she cried less today than she had done any day since her husband 's death . along with all her grief there was mixed an unusual sense of her own importance in having a `` burial , '' and in mr. [female] 's reading a special service for her husband . and besides , she knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him .
under the influence of any strongly disturbing force , clare would occasionally walk in his sleep . and even perform strange feats , such as he had done on the night of their return from market just before their marriage . when he re enacted in his bedroom his combat with the man who had insulted her . tess saw that continued mental distress had wrought him into that somnambulistic state now . her loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart .
o [female] , [female] , you are saved . and i am mad and was instantly seized with convulsions , with much commiseration she was taken out of court . while the attention of many was diverted from her , by the fierce energy with which a sailor forced his way over rails and seats . against turnkeys and policemen , the officers of the court opposed this forcible manner of entrance . but they could hardly induce the offender to adopt any quieter way of attaining his object .
a few days before [male] was at last compelled to leave , [male] called . and heard about as much as they knew themselves of their plans . when [male] said to him she would miss her pupil . he smiled in a sort of abstracted way . as if not quite apprehending what she said , which seemed to [male] a little odd .
[female] appearance was brief and undistinguished , she had nothing to say for herself . she was guided into the dock and prompted by a helpful police inspector . she was aware of the body of the court . of clerks seated at a [female] table littered with papers . of policemen standing about stiffly with expressions of conscious integrity .
mr. [male] had more open manners . and appeared to give forth his ideas without economy . he was loud , robust , and was sometimes spoken of as being `` given to indulgence '' chiefly in swearing , drinking , and beating his wife . some people who had lost by him called him a vicious man .
leaning over the stone brim of the basin . she heard footsteps stealing behind her . and knew that somebody was looking over her shoulder , the moonshine fell directly behind [female] . illuminating the palace front and the whole scene of statues and rocks . and filling the basin , as it were , with tremulous and palpable light .
but just as he had begun to abandon himself to that sweet influence . despair again took possession of him . all the old symptoms -- the fever , the weakness . the unnatural thirst , the dry , burning sensation in his throat , returned . and this time [male] was far away , his master had sent him to pay a visit to a married daughter .
the glow died away , and he began to suffer intensely , they were all lost to him . along with the life they represented , and already he began to look back on his period of forgetfulness with regret . at least then he had not known what he had lost , he wondered again what they knew . what did they think ? if they believed him dead . was that not kinder than the truth ? outside of [male] and [male] .
i am glad we met [male] , ', said [male] . `` he 's a good boy , '' she spoke soberly . she was conscious of a curious feeling of affection for the sturdy . weather tanned little man opposite her , the glimpse she had been given of his inner self had somehow made him come alive for her . `` he wants to marry my daughter , '' said lord [location] .
but the blue eyes would look at her , even when her own were shut . and always there was the faint light in the mirror . which seemed to come through the door , at last saidee could not longer lie still . she had to get up and open the door , to see what her sister was really doing . very softly she turned the handle , for she hoped that by this time victoria was asleep .
with a sense of going down stairs in a highly ridiculous manner . [male] descended in the required attitude , and only released his fair burden at the dining room door . indeed , even there she was rather difficult to be got rid of , remaining in his embrace to murmur . [female] , for mercy 's sake . do not breathe it to papa , she accompanied [male] into the room .
he relapsed into a silence which he did not again break . [male] was busy again in the afternoon , at four o'clock . feeling tired out , she went to her room to lie down until the next of her cycle of domestic duties should come round . it was late when she came downstairs . for she had fallen asleep , the sun had gone down , bees were winging their way heavily back to the hives with their honey .
it is one of the faults which resemble a duty . the nuns had committed it , not only without difficulty . but even with the applause of their own consciences , in the cloister . what is called the `` government '' is only an intermeddling with authority . an interference which is always questionable , in the first place , the rule .
while [male] , on his part , perceiving her manifest shyness and unwonted embarrassment . attributed them altogether to his own wisely guarded behavior , and , seeing therein no sign of loss of influence . continued his caution , thus the pride , which is of man . mingled with the love , which is of god , and polluted it . from that hour he began to lord it over the girl .
but my chief reason for mixing with people who were certainly as a rule utterly distasteful and repugnant to me . was because i could not bear to leave [female] alone , i pitied her in her lonely and alienated misery . and i knew that it was some small solace to her to have me with her . the tale of one day will give an approximate idea of most of the days i spent with her . i was at the time staying with her .
monsieur [female] , who was in the middle of saying something . received a great fright , and wondered whether she or her horse had gone mad . he followed her at once , calling after her anxiously , pull up , mademoiselle , pull up ! you will be killed , the solicitor did not see her . but just before she reached him he stepped on to a passing tram and was whirled away .
that he should be married soon , before he could be in orders . and consequently before he could be in possession of the living . surprised her a little at first , but she soon saw how likely it was that [female] . in her self provident care , in her haste to secure him . should overlook every thing but the risk of delay .
it is impossible to say how soon the first of these moments came , certainly when he returned to overton for the holidays with [female] 's encouraging report . she felt terribly lonely , for the last two months she had concerned herself so passionately with the discovery . one might almost say the creation -- of his soul . that his departure left her not only with a physical blank . but with a spiritual anxiety , she wondered all the time what was happening to him .
i am , really , i would be an awful idiot not to know it with three looking glasses in the room , ps . this is one of those wicked anonymous letters you read about in novels . i have just a moment , because i must attend two classes . pack a trunk and a suit case , and catch the four o'clock train . but i could not go without sending a word to let you know how much i appreciate my christmas box .
`` but a bit of cake ? '' and mrs eames by her look implored him to do her so much honour . she implored captain [female] . also , but they were both inexorable , i do not know that the two girls were at all more inclined to eat and drink than the two men . but they understood that mrs eames would be broken hearted if no one partook of her delicacies . the little sacrifices of society are all made by women .
he rose early the next morning , read two hours before breakfast by the light of his lamp . read all the morning , all the afternoon , just when the sun was going down his eyes felt weary . and he leant back in his chair , his room overlooked the front of the premises and the valley of the heath beyond . the lowest beams of the winter sun threw the shadow of the house over the palings . across the grass margin of the heath .
partly in bitterness he spoke , and partly in pure weariness . and then he turned so as not to see us ; and his white hair fell . like a shroud , around him , all things being full of flaw . all things being full of holes , the strength of all things is in shortness . if sir ensor doone had dwelled for half an hour upon himself .
the old lady smiled contentedly , out in the kitchen , the minister 's wife . who had brought up a dish of jelly , was talking to mrs. [female] about the sewing circle . through the open window , where the red vines hung . came the pungent , sun warm october air . the [female] fell over [female] 's chestnut hair like a crown of glory and youth .
i had turned to go back to my own room for a minute or two . but the sound of [female] 's name on the lips of a stranger stopped me instantly . i daresay it was very wrong and very discreditable to listen , but where is the woman . in the whole range of our sex , who can regulate her actions by the abstract principles of honour . when those principles point one way , and when her affections .
i often think , she continued after a short pause , drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation -- i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed , why has fate given you two such splendid children ? i do not speak of anatole , your youngest , i do not like him , she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows . two such charming children , and really you appreciate them less than anyone .
she went into the parlour , and found the tea things laid on the little table . and mr. [male] lying on the sofa . which was too short for him by a couple of feet . and was eked out by a chair , on which his clumsy boots rested . [male] had never seen him give way to any such self indulgence before .
a certain freedom of speech , with a bold hardihood of character . based , it is true , upon a conscious sense of honor . had brought him more than once under the notice of the prince . his highness felt such pleasure in the outspoken frankness of the man that he frequently took opportunities of conversing with him . and even asking his advice , never deterred by the subject , whatever it was .
said little [male] , `` we shall be able to go home . '' to speak of home , and to go and look at it , it being so near . was a natural sequence , they went to the closed gate . and peeped through into the court yard , `` i hope he is sound asleep , '' said little [male] , kissing one of the bars , `` and does not miss me . ''
in the hall he was certainly a lucky man who held to his weapon a moment after the door tumbled in . i blazed at the sheriff with my revolver as he stumbled and half fell at the threshold . so that the ball passed over him , but he gripped me by the legs and had me prone and half dazed by the rap of my head on the floor . i suppose i was two or three minutes . at least , getting my wits , i was first conscious of bates grappling the sheriff .
with these words , and some apology for having recourse to strong measures . i thrust my hand inside his waistcoat . and drew forth lorna 's necklace , purely sparkling in the moonlight . like the dancing of new stars , the old man made a stab at me . with a knife which i had not espied ; but the vicious onset failed .
i do not say that mrs. [female] was a woman of very strong feeling . but her strongest feelings were home feelings , she was going to mrs. [female] 's party because it might serve her husband 's purposes . she was going to burden herself with [female] because her father had asked her . and her greatest ambition was to improve the worldly position of the squires of [female] grange . she was already calculating whether it might not some day be brought about that her little [male] should sit in parliament for his county .
enjolras did not appear to be listening , but had any one been near him . that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice , `` patria . '' in fact , a new personage had entered on the scene . this was a second piece of ordnance , the artillery men rapidly performed their manoeuvres in force and placed this second piece in line with the first . a few minutes later , the two pieces , rapidly served , were firing point blank at the redoubt .
`` yes , '' said [female] , and she proceeded to tell how it came about that the luncheon and dinners were supplied from an anonymous source . for a few minutes they sat in silence . all waiting for the arrival of colonel [male] . when [organization] , sir lyster started perceptibly , taking up the receiver from the instrument he listened for a few seconds . `` show him in , '' he said ; then , turning to the others .
but he prefers the street , because there he finds liberty . he has his own games , his own bits of mischief . whose foundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois ; his peculiar metaphors . to be dead is to eat dandelions by the root ; his own occupations . calling hackney coaches , letting down carriage steps , establishing means of transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains .
brander was gone , and [female] 's fate was really in the balance . but her mind still retained all of the heart innocence , and unsophistication of her youth . a certain gentle wistfulness was the only outward change in her demeanor . he would surely send for her , there was the mirage of a distant country and wondrous scenes looming up in her mind . she had a little fortune in the bank .
and so they continued their descent in silence . and came out at last before sir [male] 's forest stronghold , where it stood . low and shady , flanked with round towers and stained with moss and lichen . in the lilied waters of the moat , even as they appeared . the doors were opened , the bridge lowered , and sir [male] himself .
write soon , dearest ; and remember that the best news i can have , will be tidings as to the day fixed for your marriage . and remember , too , that i wo not have any question about your being married at bullhampton . it would be quite improper , he must come to loring ; and i need not say how glad i shall be to see the fenwicks . [male] will expect to marry you , but mr. [male] might come and assist . at this time , during this week or two , there came to her direct from the jewellers in [location] .
she had one great longing , however , that he . her friend , who had in a way been the first to help her toward higher things . and to save her from the wilderness , might know jesus [male] as he had not known him when they were together . and so in her daily prayer she often talked with her heavenly father about him . until she came to have an abiding faith that some day .
edna did not reveal so much as all this to madame ratignolle that summer day when they sat with faces turned to the sea . but a good part of it escaped her . she had put her head down on madame ratignolle 's shoulder . she was flushed and felt intoxicated with the sound of her own voice and the unaccustomed taste of candor . it muddled her like wine .
[male] raised the poor intendant , embraced him as if he had been a brother . and , having nobly saluted the assembly , who all bowed as they whispered to each other his name . he went and took his seat at the extremity of the great carved oak hall . still holding by the hand poor [male] , who was suffocating with excess of woe . and sank upon the steps , then the procureur , who , like the rest .
nice , yes , how are you to get butter , milk , and eggs up here ? no pigs , no poultry , no postman . why , i should go mad , [male] , what a dear little practical mind it is . what a wife you will make , nice , do not be too sure -- we are only partly married . the marriage ceremony lasts all day , nice .
just for a moment , absurdly over estimating poor [male] 's skill . he supposed himself a victim of legerdemain . another moment , and the import of the studs revealed itself . he staggered up from his chair , covering his breast with one arm . and murmured that he was faint , as he hurried from the room .
for the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to [location] it was necessary . that they should form themselves into a military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike military group of the east . that they should abandon all established traditions and customs . and that during their military movement they should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them the deceptions . robberies , and murders which would have to be committed during that movement .
in the liquor line [female] laid in an ample barrel of casterbridge `` strong beer . '' this renowned drink -- now almost as much a thing of the past as falstaff 's favourite beverage . was not only well calculated to win the hearts of soldiers blown dry and dusty by residence in tents on a hill top . but of any wayfarer whatever in that land . it was of the most beautiful colour that the eye of an artist in beer could desire .
beside him rode an hussar , with a boy in a tattered french uniform and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse . the boy held on to the hussar with cold , red hands . and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise . this was the french drummer boy captured that morning . behind them along the narrow , sodden , cutup forest road came hussars in threes and fours .
on entering her room she struck a light and then tried to warm her chilled limbs over a few faint coals which still glimmered on the hearth . but there was no wood in the room and she dared not go for any . so she sat down with her cloak still around her . and for four long hours studied as she had never done before in all her life . at the end of that time her lessons were very nearly learned .
in the crowd which surrounded and cheered lafayette , it was noticed that a german showed himself named ludwig snyder . who died a centenarian afterwards , who had also been in the war of 1776 . and who had fought at [location] under [location] , and at brandywine under lafayette . in the meantime , the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set in motion . and came to bar the bridge , on the right bank the dragoons emerged from the celestins and deployed along the quai morland .
a feeling of exultation overtook her , as if some power of significant import had been given her to control the working of her body and her soul . she grew daring and reckless , overestimating her strength , she wanted to swim far out . where no woman had swum before , her unlooked for achievement was the subject of wonder . applause , and admiration , each one congratulated himself that his special teachings had accomplished this desired end . she turned her face seaward to gather in an impression of space and solitude .
this cry was uttered equally by the republicans , but coming from them . this cry was logical , what was blindness in the legitimists was clearness of vision in the democrats . 1830 had bankrupted the people , the enraged democracy reproached it with this . between the attack of the past and the attack of the future . the establishment of july struggled , it represented the minute at loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries .
he was again a member of [organization] . was again in possession of that privilege for which he had never ceased to sigh since the moment in which he lost it . a drunkard or a gambler may be weaned from his ways . but not a politician , to have been in the house and not to be there was . to such a one as [male] finn .
the carriage door was opened , on the left there was water . a great river -- and on the right a porch . there were people at the entrance : servants , and a [female] girl with a large plait of [female] hair . smiling as it seemed to princess [female] in an unpleasantly affected way . princess [female] ran up the steps .
he waited , pacing up and down before the herdic , a sicilian youth with eyes like [location] 's offered to shine his boots . and an irish matron to sell him peaches . and every few moments the doors opened to let out hot men with straw hats tilted far back . who glanced at him as they went by , he marvelled that the door should open so often . and that all the people it let out should look so like each other , and so like all the other hot men who .
`` neffer , '' replied the swiss , enchanted that a man like [male] could envy him anything . `` neffer , neffer , '' [male] , seeing [male] rise . did likewise , took his arm , and went out , [male] and [male] remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the swiss . as to [male] , he went and lay down on a truss of straw . and as he had more imagination than the swiss , he dreamed that [male] .
there was a shout of surprise and consternation from the gentlemen on the terrace and the crowd upon the lawn . a shrill scream from the women ; and in the next moment [male] was writhing under a shower of blows from the hunting whip in [male] arundel 's hand . the artist was not physically brave , yet he was not such a cur as to submit unresistingly to this hideous disgrace . but the attack was so sudden and unexpected as to paralyse him -- so rapid in its execution as to leave him no time for resistance . before he had recovered his presence of mind .
but in the next moment he was ready to fancy himself the weak dupe of his own imagination . [male] was a superb horsewoman ; and in no costume did she look more attractive than in her exquisitely fitting habit of dark blue cloth . the early hour of the meet justified her breakfasting in riding costume . and gladly availing herself of this excuse , she made her appearance in her habit . carrying her pretty little riding hat and dainty whip in her hand , her cheeks were flushed with a rich bloom .
an experience extending over a very active business career of thirty years had convinced colonel [male] pennington of the futility of wracking his brains in vain speculation over mysteries . in his day he had been interested in some small public service corporations . which is tantamount to saying that he knew peanut politics and had learned that the very best way to fight the devil is with fire . frequently he had found it of great interest and profit to him to know exactly how certain men spent their time and his money . and since he was a very busy man himself .
several minutes elapsed thus , and the light retreated , but he heard no sound of footsteps . which seemed to indicate that the person who had been listening at the door had removed his shoes . [male] threw himself , all dressed as he was . on his bed , and could not close his eyes all night . at daybreak , just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue .
for the first time it came upon him that this was home . that the forest , and the silence , and the little cabin hidden under the spruce tops below held a deeper meaning for him than a few hours before . when kazan was a leaping , living comrade at his side . kazan was dead , down there he would bury him . and he had loved kazan ; -- he knew .
`` he must not know you are here , '' and lest willoughby should move . she caught his arm tight in her hand . willoughby did not pursue his inquiries , [male] 's manner constrained him to silence . she sat very still , still as she wished him to sit . and in a queer huddled attitude ; she was even holding her breath .
during one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could . with some help from esther as to certain legal terms , and when the good natured frenchwoman had signed her name . [female] felt relieved and laid it by to show laurie . whom she wanted as a second witness , as it was a rainy day . she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers .
mr [male] might become a shining light to the moneyed world . and a glory to the banking interests . he might be a future chancellor of the exchequer . but then again , it might turn out that , in these affairs , he was a mere ignis fatuus . a blind guide , -- a man to be laid aside as very respectable .
every moment , he kept asking the doctor . `` is he no longer in danger ? '' he gazed upon marius with the eyes of a grandmother . he brooded over him while he ate . he no longer knew himself , he no longer rendered himself an account of himself . marius was the master of the house .
in which two cousins are contestants for the same prizes . political honors and the hand of a girl . the hero finally conquers both himself and his enemies and wins the love of a wonderful girl . may be had wherever books are sold , ask for grosset and [male] 's list . the tale of a `` quarter strain [male] and three quarters husky ''
florence really was sick , then -- dangerously sick , the doctor had not deceived them . had not magnified the trouble as she supposed ; but it could not be that she was dead , dead ! why , only a few minutes ago she was sleeping so quietly , well , she was very quiet now . could the heart have ceased its beating ? `` i will go over home with you now , '' he said , speaking low and kindly , he seemed to under stand just how shocked she felt .
[male] 's reply was very short and apparently very [male] . he deprecated the delay of twelve months . and still hoped to be able to induce her to be more lenient to him . he advised her to write to mr grey at once . and as regarded the squire he gave her carte [female] to act as she pleased .
`` oh , a little bird told us , '' said miss browning , molly knew that little bird from her childhood . and had always hated it , and longed to wring its neck , why could not people speak out and say that they did not mean to give up the name of their informant ? but it was a very favourite form of fiction with the miss brownings . and to miss [female] it was the very acme of wit .
and papa and the children , and the lonely and far-away feelings ? there was never a mention of them in this [female] acceptance . oh , clover , clover , circumstances do alter cases ! mrs. hope 's rubber of whist seemed a long one . for [female] did not get home till a quarter before eleven .
mr peters was now very old , and i am disposed to think he had forgotten all about it . the other two gentlemen were both young , and they stood very high in the graces of all the company there assembled . they were high in the graces of mr stumfold . but higher still in the graces of mrs stumfold . and were almost worshipped by one or two other ladies whose powers of external adoration were not diminished by the possession of husbands .
permit me to say that i am a man much older than you . and one who has mixed much both with clergymen and with the world at large . i tell you with absolute confidence . that it is not your duty in your present position to give up your living . should your conduct ever be called in question on this matter you will be at perfect liberty to say that you were guided by my advice .
[female] had never done him any but good services . so much the greater his spleen , he was revenged upon [male] . now he had broken through his prison walls . his escape was accomplished , that which would be regarded as his death , would be . in fact , the beginning of his life .
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other . they were not the only objects of mr. [male] 's admiration . the hall , the dining room , and all its furniture . were examined and praised ; and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs. bennet 's heart . but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .
here 's a misunderstanding for you , [female] , who felt the shame but did not believe in the guilt of her father . retorted fiercely , `` nevertheless i am as honourable as you are , '' and then the german woman nearly went into a fit from rage . `` i shall have you thrown out into the street , '' what is to be noted is that even in [location] . having had time to take a reflective view , poor [female] was far from being certain as to the true inwardness of her violent dismissal . she felt the humiliation of it with an almost maddened resentment .
[female] called upon me to admit that this was pretty cool , considering . and there was another thing , too , it seems that for the last six months ( she had been assisting two ladies who kept a kindergarten school in bayswater . a mere pittance ) , [female] had insisted on devoting all her spare time to the study of the trial . she had been looking up files of old newspapers . and working herself up into a state of indignation with what she called the injustice and the hypocrisy of the prosecution .
only [male] lay awake after that , and it was [male] who roused jolly [male] in what would have been the early dawn outside the snow dune . mckay felt his restless movement . and opened his eyes , a faint light was illumining his room . and he sat up , in the outer room the alcohol lamp was burning again . he could hear movement , and voices that were very low and indistinct .
eliza was there , , , very much so , , , and looked even grimmer than usual . miss eliza was one of those people who give you the impression that life is indeed a vale of tears . and that a smile , never to speak of a laugh , is a waste of nervous energy truly reprehensible . the [female] girls had been `` girls '' for fifty odd years and seemed likely to remain girls to the end of their earthly pilgrimage . [female] , it was said , had not entirely given up hope .
he had been reading belfort bax . and declared himself a convert , he contrasted the lot of women in general with the lot of men . presented men as patient , self immolating martyrs . and women as the pampered favorites of nature . a vein of conviction mingled with his burlesque .
she said this in a loud , ringing voice . with the imperious tone of a woman accustomed to command , she was leaning against one angle of the great chimney piece . pale as ashes , breathless , but not fainting . to her , the idea that any calamity had befallen [female] was very dreadful . almost as dreadful as it could be to the brother who so truly loved him .
216 , a [male] foray , that is , a raid in the lands of the [male] family . bordering on the southern end of loch lomond , on the island of inch murrin . the ruins of [male] castle . formerly a residence of the earls of [male] . are still to be seen , there was another of their strongholds on the shore of the lake near balloch .
this was the manner in which [female] and [female] were . as usual , conversing , and walking backwards and forwards in the long alley of limes in the park . when the bell which served to announce to the comte either the hour of dinner or the arrival of a visitor , was rung . and , without attaching any importance to it , he turned towards the house with his son . and at the end of the alley they found themselves in the presence of [male] and [male] .
or to join in a certain romping hide and seek game called `` un , deux , trois , '' were formerly also of hourly occurrence ; but all these little attentions had ceased some time ago . ceased , too , without my finding it necessary to be at the trouble of point blank cutting them short . i had now no familiar demonstration to dread or endure , save from one quarter . and as that was english i could bear it , [female] made no scruple of .
he had become conscious again that , a few feet off , on the other side of a thin partition . a small keen flame of life was quivering and agitating the air . sophy 's face came hack to him insistently . it was as vivid now as mrs. [male] 's had been a moment earlier . he recalled with a faint smile of retrospective pleasure the girl 's enjoyment of her evening .
`` stop , stop , '' cried [male] , giving rein to his famous steed . who , darting forth , overturned several men , `` stop , stop ! '' cried the soldiers , and ran for their arms , but the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate . in the middle of the street they saw [male] and [male] . who were coming to find their masters , with one wave of his hand [male] made [male] .
mr. [male] , who understood very little of trench 's meaning . nevertheless cordially agreed to the proposal , `` i think it would be prudent , '' said he . and he hailed a passing cab . a moment later the two men were driving to albemarle street . therefore it was that as he rode the next morning into the row his blue eyes looked out upon the world from his bronzed face with not a jot less of his usual friendliness .
all this was quite as it should be , [male] 's heart fluttered like the wings of a young bird that essays its first flight . while the young man was still pleading , while she was still listening to him . and blushing and glancing shyly at him out of those wonderful tawny coloured eyes . which seemed [male] just now under the shadow of their drooping lashes . sigismund and the orphans appeared at the distant gate of the churchyard whooping and hallooing .
things were thus in the old house , when the growing affection of [female] for [female] took form one day in the request that she would make thornwick the goal of her sunday walk . she repented , it is true , the moment she had said the words . from dread of her aunt ; but they had been said . and were accepted , [female] went , and the aunt difficulty had been got over . the friendship of [female] also had now run into that of the girls .
renewing his enquiries concerning the fate of ivanhoe . the only information which the cupbearer could collect from the bystanders was . that the knight had been raised with care by certain well attired grooms . and placed in a litter belonging to a lady among the spectators . which had immediately transported him out of the press , [male] , on receiving this intelligence .
[male] could see the whole thing from his window . and when [male] came in with supper , he found the meat they were cooking over the fire was fresh moose steak . as there had been no trading or firing of guns coming down . he was puzzled and when he asked where the meat had come from [male] only shrugged his shoulders and winked an eye . and went out singing about the [male] bird that had everything plucked from it .
[male] did not appear any more that night ; and , if they had wanted him now . they would not have known where to find him , he was about nothing very bad . only supping with some friends -- such friends as he did not even care to tell that he had a son . he was ashamed of being in [location] at this time of the year . and , but that he had not money enough to go anywhere except to his mother 's .
one night that [location] and [female] had been detained by company . in ceremonial restraint , later than usual , they were induced , by the easy conversation of madame . and by the pleasure which a return to liberty naturally produces , to defer the hour of repose till the night was far advanced . they were engaged in interesting discourse , when madame . who was then speaking , was interrupted by a low hollow sound , which arose from beneath the apartment .
our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event . but every human action appears to [male] as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability . in every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability . and always the more freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive . and the more inevitability the less freedom , the proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded .
where have yo been ? she asked , in slow , hoarse tones . as if her voice were half strangled within her , `` been ! '' said he , a red light coming into his eyes . as he bent his looks upon her ; now , indeed , a true and not an assumed suspicion entering his mind , been ! ', he repeated . then , coming a step nearer to her , and taking her hand .
the distance to copperhouse cross was twelve miles . and [male] found himself placed in the carriage next to madame goesler . it had not been done of fixed design ; but when a party of six are seated in a carriage . the chances are that one given person will be next to or opposite to any other given person . madame [organization] had remembered this , and had prepared herself .
but my own distresses silenced all these reflections , and the prospect of my own starving . which grew every day more frightful to me , hardened my heart by degrees . it was then particularly heavy upon my mind , that i had been reformed . and had , as i hoped , repented of all my past wickedness ; that i had lived a sober . grave , retired life for several years .
the other girl , with an air of saying something new . repeated her statement that it was the limit . the duchess cried forlornly throughout , she had needed this engagement badly . chorus salaries are not stupendous , but it is possible to save money by means of them during a [location] run . especially if you have spent three years in a milliner 's shop and can make your own clothes .
by and bye he should place her in his lap , and try more and more to gain her consent . and if she will not yield to him he should frighten her by saying . i shall impress marks of my teeth and nails on your lips and breasts . and then make similar marks on my own body , and shall tell my friends that you did them . what will you say then ? in this and other ways , as fear and confidence are created in the minds of children .
in spite of , , , or perhaps , human nature being what it is , because of . this , the society went gamely to work at the only improvement they could hope to bring about that fall . at the second meeting , in the barry parlor . [female] sloane moved that they start a subscription to re shingle and paint the hall . [female] bell seconded it .
he added , pointing to the open book which [female] held in her hands . she was turning the leaves about , with her eyes cast down upon the pages . so would she have sat , shy and trembling , if sir [male] . or [male] , or the [male] , or [male] the great . or any other grand melancholy creature , could have been conjured into life and planted by her side .
during the [female] a whiff of cold air came into helene 's box . the door opened , and anatole entered , stooping and trying not to brush against anyone . `` let me introduce my brother to you , '' said helene , her eyes shifting uneasily from [female] to anatole . [female] turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer and smiled at him over her bare shoulder .
nor are we mistaken , for he soon crosses the room . and going up to one of them , a rosy cheeked , blue eyed girl , he says in a low tone . i am glad you have come , [female] . i had almost given you up , and concluded you were doing penance for some misdemeanor . and so could not come out , then taking her upon his arm , he kept her near him all the evening .
after his one remark to her escort , the woodsman turned to the girl . and , in spite of sammy 's persistent attempts to bring the now sullen ollie into the conversation . ignored the man completely , when they had talked for a few moments . young [male] said , i reckon you will have to excuse me a minute , sammy . i left the engine in such a hurry when you called that i will have to look at it again .
he waited now to see the same thing happen to this youthful lawyer from gavrillac . but he waited in vain , andre louis found him ridiculous . he knew pretentiousness for the mask of worthlessness and weakness . and here he beheld pretentiousness incarnate , it was to be read in that arrogant poise of the head . that scowling brow , the inflexion of that reverberating voice .
but further reflection told her that she was presumptuous in demanding his attention to such a subject . he would not disapprove of her occupying herself with it in leisure moments . as other women expected to occupy themselves with their dress and embroidery . would not forbid it when -- [female] felt rather ashamed as she detected herself in these speculations . but her uncle had been invited to go to [male] to stay a couple of days .
on the left , a hedge ; on the right , a wall . and at the end , a wall , the wall on the right is of brick . the wall at the bottom is of stone . one enters the garden first , it slopes downwards . is planted with gooseberry bushes , choked with a wild growth of vegetation .
the paternal longing ran on all fours with her own desire . and yet in forwarding it yesterday she had been on the brink of giving offence . while craving to be a country girl again just as her father requested . to put off the old eve , the fastidious miss -- or rather madam . completely , her first attempt had been beaten by the unexpected vitality of that fastidiousness .
but , as she said to herself over and over again , all that must go for nothing . it must be for bell , and for her only , to answer [female] 's question . in her mind there was something sacred in that idea of love . she would regard her daughter almost as a castaway if she were to marry any man without absolutely loving him . loving him as [female] loved her lover .
the emperor passed on to the drawing room . the crowd made a rush for the doors . and several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again , then the crowd hastily retired from the drawing room door . at which the emperor reappeared talking to the hostess , a young man . looking distraught , pounced down on the ladies , asking them to move aside .
i love you , i love you . so let good night bring you good morning ! at long intervals , dearest , i write to you a secret all about yourself for my eyes to see . because , chiefly because , i have not you to look at . thus i bless myself with you .
ha found no pleasure in the society that had known him as a lion . women bored him ; men annoyed him . the play suffocated him ; the tiresome club was ruining his temper . the whole world was going wrong , the doctor told him he was approaching nervous prostration . his mother 's anxious eyes could no longer be denied , so he realized grimly that there was but one course left open to him .
talking continuously , elated with the sense of conflict still to come , he drove with her to the club . considering that drive in the light of after events . his own frame of mind invariably filled him with incredulity . in the eyes of any sane man his position was not worth an hour 's purchase . yet in the blind self confidence of the moment he would not have changed places with fraide himself .
`` here i be , enoch , '' said a voice ; and the procession advancing farther . the lantern 's rays illuminated the figure of geoffrey . awaiting their arrival beside a row of bee hives . in front of the path , taking the spade from enoch . he proceeded to dig two holes in the earth beside the hives .
the tuesday 's magistrates meeting had come off at heytesbury . and [male] had been discharged , mr. [male] had on this occasion indignantly demanded that his client should be set free without bail . but to this the magistrates would not assent , the attorney attempted to demonstrate to them that they could not require bail for the reappearance of an accused person . when that accused person was discharged simply because there was no evidence against him . but to this exposition of the law sir [male] and his brother magistrates would not listen .
therefore i set to again , with a fixed resolve not to notice pain or stiffness . but to warm them out of me , and sure enough , before dark that day . i could get along pretty freely ; especially improving every time , after leaving off and resting . the astonishment of poor [female] , [female] , and [female] slocombe . when they saw me coming down the hill upon them .
briefly after the judicial combat , cedric the saxon was summoned to the court of [female] . which , for the purpose of quieting the counties that had been [male] by the ambition of his brother . was then held at york , cedric tushed and pshawed more than once at the message . but he refused not obedience , in fact . the return of [male] had quenched every hope that he had entertained of restoring a saxon dynasty in [location] .
the previous autumn , the hunting , `` uncle , '' and the christmas holidays spent with [female] at otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most painfully . what would she not have given to bring back even a single day of that time ! but it was gone forever , her presentiment at the time had not deceived her . that that state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment would not return again .
it was too late , there was no room to get the [female] under the axle . she remembered from the narratives of motoring friends that brush in mud gave a firmer surface for the wheels to climb upon . she also remembered how jolly and agreeably heroic the accounts of their mishaps had sounded . a week after they were over , seven trips she made . carrying armfuls of twigs and solemnly dragging large boughs behind her .
she saw him pass from the open into the fringe of timber near the big gap . and , a few minutes later , saw him reappear beyond the deer lick . still she watched as he moved along the rim of the hollow . looking in the distance like a toy man on a toy horse . watched until he passed from sight into the timber again .
pondering over all this , michel voss resolved that he would have it all out with his niece on the following sunday . on the sunday he engaged [male] to start with him after dinner to the place on the hillside where they were cutting wood . it was a beautiful autumn afternoon . in that pleasantest of all months in the year . when the sun is not too hot , and the air is fresh and balmy .
[male] simply could not grasp such an attitude of mind . he regarded windles not as a private house but as a social club . and was utterly unable to see any difference between the human beings he knew and the strangers who dropped in for a late chat after the place was locked up . he had no intention of biting [male] . the idea never entered his head , at the present moment what he felt about [male] was that he was one of the best fellows he had ever met and that he loved him like a brother .
a very rough and headstrong road was all that she remembered , for she could not think as she wished to do . with the cold iron pushed against her , at the end of this road they delivered her eyes . and she could scarce believe them , for she stood at the head of a deep [location] . carved from out the mountains in a perfect oval , with a fence of sheer rock standing round it . eighty feet or a hundred high ; from whose brink [female] wooded hills swept up to the sky line .
sometimes in the evening , a little after sunset , at the moment when the dusk of the sky mingles with the dusk of the sea . and twilight invests the waves with a mysterious awe . the people beheld , entering the harbour ofsampson . upon the dark rolling waters , a strange . undefined thing , a monstrous form which puffed and blew .
[male] there came the three knights that fought with sir [male] at the long bridge . and there they yielded them unto sir [male] . and sir [male] forsook them and said he fought never with them . but i shall ease your heart , said sir [male] , yonder is sir [male] that overcame you . when they wist that they were glad , and then sir meliot [male] logres came home .
when sir [male] finally slew the hope of that return he did a wiser thing than he conceived . never since [male] 's disappearance had they heard any news of him until [male] came to arwenack with that letter and his story . they had heard , as had all the world , of the corsair [male] . but they had been far indeed from connecting him with [male] . now that his identity was established by [male] 's testimony .
on the door there were words inscribed , which were just legible in the gloom -- ', signing room , mr vavasor . [male] entered the room and found mr vavasor sitting all alone in an arm chair over the fire . i rather think that that breathing had been the breathing of a man asleep . he was resting himself amidst the labours of his signing . it was a large , dull room , which could not have been painted , i should think .
i have made it now , and your lordship may satisfy yourself by referring to the maps of the parish lands . which are to be found in the bishop 's chancery , and also atjohn 's . oxford , if you can not do so by any survey of the estate in your own possession . i enclose a sketch showing the exact limits of the glebe in respect to the vicarage entrance and the patch of ground in question . the fact is , that the chapel in question has been built on the glebe land by authority .
the air of the night was very still , but dim with a peculiar mist . which changed the moonlight into a luminous haze , in this air . or this mist , there was some quality -- electrical , perhaps -- which acted in strange sort upon me . i felt then as i had felt a year ago in [location] . on a night when the [male] borealis was streaming and sweeping round heaven .
the traveller straightened himself up , he walked on a few paces . and went off to look over the tops of the hedges , on the horizon through the trees . he perceived a sort of little elevation . and on this elevation something which at that distance resembled a lion . hougomont , -- this was a funereal spot , the beginning of the obstacle .
the young king felt the tears rise to his eyes . he bent over the dying man , already half a corpse . and then hastily retired , the whole night was passed in anguish , common to the dying man and to the king . the dying man expected his deliverance , the king awaited his liberty . [male] did not go to bed , an hour after leaving the chamber of the cardinal .
clarissa shivered , send to miss granger , suffer those cold eyes to see the depth of her humiliation ! that would be hard to endure , yet what did anything in the world matter to her when her boy was in jeopardy ? `` we shall save him , [male] , '' she said with a desperate hopefulness , clasping her hands and bending down to kiss the troubled little one . who had brief snatches of sleep now and then in weary hours of restlessness .
such were the pastimes of mrs. siddons before the days of her fame . no doubt this kind of lightheartedness was the best antidote to the experience of being `` saluted with volleys of potatoes and broken bottles '' as the siddonses were by the citizens of liverpool . for having ventured to appear on their stage without having ever played before the king . on this occasion , the audience , according to a letter from kemble to mrs. [male] .
with perturbed expectancy she hurried through the passageway . willie tagging at her heels , the infrequently patronized portal of the [female] mansion . it proved , was so securely barred and bolted that to unfasten it necessitated no little time and patience . even after locks and fastenings had been withdrawn and the door was at liberty to move . not knowing what to do with its unaccustomed freedom it refused to stir , stubbornly resisting every attempt to [male] its hinges asunder .
i received my instructions and packed up for the journey the next day . on leaving [female] once more in her sister 's care . a serious consideration recurred to me , which had more than once crossed my wife 's mind . as well as my own , already -- i mean the consideration of [female] 's future . had we any right to let our selfish affection accept the devotion of all that generous life ?
the scheme now projected by [male] , was to acquaint the surgeon who had already attended mr. [male] with his present situation and address . and to desire him to continue his visits , for the payment of which she would herself be accountable . [female] , the name of the surgeon . she had already heard mentioned by mr. [female] . and in getting into her chair , she ordered [female] .
when i had gone into [female] 's room . and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held . i asked him if he would go to bed ? he said yes . but asked me for some of my `` gentleman 's linen '' to put on in the morning , i brought it out .
he left pearce in his chair and went directly to the factor 's quarters . [male] , chief factor of the [male] 's bay company in the far north . could give him no more information than had pearce . he had never heard of fort o ', god . he could not remember the name of couchee .
with his first calm words a vivid colour flashed into her cheeks . which never left them again during the evening , she did not seem to have much to say to him . she disappointed him by the quiet way in which she asked what seemed to him to be the merely necessary questions respecting her old acquaintances , in [male] . but others came in -- more intimate in the house than he . and he fell into the background , where he and mr. [female] talked together from time to time .
antigonus , be certain what you do , sir , lest your justice prove violence . in the which three great ones suffer , yourself , your queen , your son , first lord . for her , my lord , -- i dare my life lay down . and will [location] , sir , please you to accept it . that the queen is spotless i the eyes of heaven and to you .
`` that is not our creed at beechwood , '' said mrs. [female] . abruptly , as she ceased the conversation , but ever and anon it seemed to recur to her mind . ay , through all the mirth of the young people . all the graver pleasure which the father took in the happiness of his son [male] . his good son , who had never given him a single care .
the family have had many letters from her that are read by each and all of the famild . there was quite a wind storm thursday doing damage to shade trees in many parts of our beautiful city . from letters to the family miss [female] atwater of this city is enjoying her visit in the south a greadeal . the new ditch of the mr. [male] . backyard of this city is about through now as little remain to be done and it is thought the beighborhood will son look better .
but such resolutions are not easily reached , and [female] laboured through half the night almost in vain . she knew that she loved the man . she knew that he was as true to her as the sun is true to the earth . she knew that she would be , in all respects . safe in his hands , she knew that lady [female] would be delighted .
the first signs of weakening inspired her afresh and at last she was riding over him rough shod . a happy [female] , she made promises that yetive herself could not have made . she offered inducements that never could be carried out , although in her zeal she did not know it to be so . she painted such pictures of ease . comfort and pleasure that he wondered why royalty did not exchange places with its servants .
jane came to him , and for a moment they stood together . looking up the chancel , it was darker than the rest of the church . being lighted only by three narrow stained-glass windows , gems of colour and of significance . the centre window , immediately over the communion table . represented the saviour of the world , dying upon the cross .
his eyes glared with the wolf gleam , and the music was vulgarly atrocious and out of tune . as christmas drew near , the weather increased in severity . blinding snow squalls swept whirling from the northeast , accompanied by a high wind . the air was full of it , -- fine , dry , powdery , like the dust of glass . the men worked covered with it as a tree is covered after a sleet .
the blood rushed into the countenance of prince [male] . he swore one of his deepest oaths , and was about to utter some threat corresponding in violence . when he was diverted from his purpose , partly by his own attendants . who gathered around him conjuring him to be patient , partly by a general exclamation of the crowd . uttered in loud applause of the spirited conduct of cedric .
the vessel passed , the fisherman returned home . on that same night , at different hours , and at different points . various persons scattered and isolated on the western coast of guernsey . observed certain facts , as the omptolle fisherman was mooring his bark . a carter of seaweed about half a mile off .
in 1874 , after a year or two of unsuccessful effort to make a living in various employments . he became assistant at the court library . which was indeed a haven of refuge , a position providing both leisure for study and an assured income . finding in the library some chinese parchments which had not been catalogued ; he plunged into the study of that language . a treatise which he wrote on the subject won him medals from various learned societies at home .
there was a good deal of company already scattered about the lawn when [male] and his friend were ushered into the pretty drawing room . the cheerful sound of croquet balls came from a level stretch of grass visible from the windows . and quite a little fleet of boats were jostling one another at the landing by the swiss boat house . mrs. [female] came in from the garden to welcome them . looking very pretty in a coquettish little white chip hat with a scarlet feather .
sheds the still more miserable pretences of superiority , makeshifts of adornment . and chains of custom , whom the gods love . die young , has been too long carelessly said , it is not true . in the sense in which men use the words . whom the gods love , dwell with nature ; if they are ever lured away .
all was undisturbed in the dining room ; the table was just as they had left it . [female] approached the table , took up the carafon containing curaçoa . and , holding it up to the light with one hand . poured the contents of a small phial into it with the other . he watched the one liquid mingling with the other until no further traces of the operation were visible .
next morning , after breakfast , [male] began his whet . whet , whet , i glanced warily at him . for i was on my knees taking the ashes from the stove . when i returned from throwing them overside , he was talking to [male] . whose honest yokel 's face was filled with [male] and wonder .
between five and six weeks passed , oscar was out of his bed room . and was well of his wound , during this lapse of time . lucilla steadily pursued that process of her own of curing him , which was to end in marrying him . never had i seen such nursing before -- never do i expect to see such nursing again . from morning to night , she interested him .
if she meant consciously or unconsciously to belittle the seclusion and security of a country cottage . she did not succeed ; for [female] 's determination was genuine . but she made him visualize her in her own character . so that he looked quickly at her , as she walked a little in front of him across the plowed field . for the first time that morning he saw her independently of him or of his preoccupation with katharine .
by degrees , he turned on her his manly countenance . with the softest expression of which his large blue eye , which so often gleamed with insufferable light , was capable . caressing her fair head , and mingling his large fingers in her beautiful and dishevelled locks . he raised and tenderly kissed the cherub countenance which seemed desirous to hide itself in his hand . the robust form , the broad , noble brow and majestic looks .
at that moment the door of the room was opened . and a man entered with quick steps , came a few yards in . and then retreated , slamming the door after him , he was a man with thick short red hair . and an abundance of very red beard , and his face was red . and , as it seemed to [male] , his very eyes , there was something in the countenance of the man which struck him almost with dread .
count pateroff had again called in bolton street . and had again been refused admittance , it was plain to him to see by the servant 's manner that it was intended that he should understand that he was not to be admitted . under such circumstances , it was necessary that he must either abandon his pursuit . or that he must operate upon lady ongar through some other feeling than her personal regard for himself . he might , perhaps , have trusted much to his own eloquence if he could have seen her .
[male] , ruined by early independence and bad domestic example . indulged in the freaks of a cold blooded vanity a little too long , once it had . by an opening undesigned and unmerited , led him into the way of happiness . could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one amiable woman 's affections . could he have found sufficient exultation in overcoming the reluctance .
d'artagnan , a little recovered from his first surprise , had now leisure to study costumes and physiognomy . the center of the most animated group was a musketeer of great height and haughty countenance . dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract general attention , he did not wear the uniform cloak . which was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence . but a cerulean blue doublet , a little faded and worn , and over this a magnificent baldric .
accompanying it there was a moment of fear . of fear driven almost to the point of actual terror . following it came a reaction so swift that kent was dazed . within those ten seconds the girl 's slender body seemed to grow taller . a new light flamed in her face ; her eyes .
when [male] the [male] saw griflet so lie . he horsed him again anon . and they two did marvellous deeds of arms with many bachelors . also sir [male] came out of an ambushment with five knights with him . and they six smote other six down , but sir [male] did that day marvellous deeds of arms .
most of the people at that early hour were still in bed and asleep . a few , who intended to go over to the cheniere for mass , were moving about . the lovers , who had laid their plans the night before . were already strolling toward the wharf , the lady in [female] . with her sunday prayer book , velvet and gold clasped , and her sunday silver beads .
when [female] received mrs. redmain 's card . inviting her with her husband to an evening party , it raised in her a bewildered flutter . of pleasure , of fear , of pride . of shyness , of dismay : how dared she show her face in such a grand assembly ? she would not know a bit how to behave herself !
after all , however , there was a dull space of time which needed relieving with bread and cheese and ale . and when he was seated alone with these resources in the wainscoted parlor . he suddenly slapped his knee , and exclaimed , [male] ! that action of memory which he had tried to set going . and had abandoned in despair , had suddenly completed itself without conscious effort .
but to compensate for loss of shape , they were dazzling white . marvellous as columns of carved pearl in the moonlight . they and their surrounding walls seeming to send out an eerie . bleached light of their own which struck at the eye , the uneven path ran floods of moonlight . and from tiny windows in the leaning snow palaces -- windows like little golden frames .
but , at the age of fifty , even that is almost better than one which charges him with such attempt against a lady 's heart . he knew that he was not dishonest , and therefore could endure the first , he was not quite sure that he was not . or might not become , ridiculous , and therefore feared the latter very greatly , he could not ignore the letter . and there was nothing for it but to show it to his lawyer . unfortunately , he had told this lawyer , on the very day of mr maguire 's visit to the cedars .
`` mother is in the parlour , '' said [female] . `` she is waiting for you , '' by the window . in a wide wooden arm chair , sat a large woman about sixty . dressed in [female] , she wore on either side of her long white face two corkscrew curls . which gave her a somewhat ridiculous appearance , but she ceased to be ridiculous or grotesque when she rose from her chair to greet her son .
`` this is june 's room , '' he said . opening the next door and putting the can down ; `` i think you will find everything . '' and closing the door behind her he went back to his own room . brushing his hair with his great ebony brushes . and dabbing his forehead with [male] , he mused .
a little scene ensued , which , as miss [female] said afterwards . was most unpleasant , the horses were stopped , the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves . the boy was to lose his pourboire , the girl was immediately to get down . `` she is my sister , '' said he . turning round on them with piteous eyes .
restore to me that little spot . with gray walls compassed round , where knotted grass neglected lies . and weeds usurp the ground , the thirsty rivers drink their store . and bear it rolling to the shore , but still the ocean craves for more . tis endless labour everywhere , sound can not satisfy the ear .
`` oh , you open my eyes , '' replied the giant . stunned by the insinuation , and [male] , whose eyes this reply of his friend 's had at last opened . or rather thickened the bandage which covered his sight , went with his best speed to the batteries to overlook his people . and exhort every one to do his duty , in the meantime , [male] , with his eye fixed on the horizon . saw the ships continually drawing nearer , the people and the soldiers .
mr moffat did not do much towards improving the conviviality of the castle . he was , of course , a good deal intent upon his coming election . and spent much of his time with mr nearthewinde , the celebrated parliamentary agent . it behoved him to be a good deal at barchester . canvassing the electors and undermining , by mr nearthewinde 's aid .
seldom is even a fierce bulldog heard to growl . yet corker growled at [female] , the duke did not try to break the stony silence in which [female] walked . her displeasure was a luxury to him . for it was so soon to be dispelled , a little while , and she would be hating herself for her pettiness . here was he , going to die for her ; and here was she , blaming him for a breach of manners .
my missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their tabards . the showy gilding was a neat idea . i could have got the king to wear a bulletin board for the sake of that barbaric splendor . they were to spell out these signs and then explain to the lords and ladies what soap was . and if the lords and ladies were afraid of it .
she could not -- how could she , believing as she did in purity . in responsibility for the effect of one 's actions on others . bear his work , bear living by it . and he she knew , had at first resented and then been merely bored by her religion . he had let her slip away ; he had given her up .
look here ; i wo not walk another inch with you . if you say any jokes about him ! tess cried , and the colour upon her cheeks spread over her face and neck . in a moment her eyes grew moist . and her glance drooped to the ground , perceiving that they had really pained her they said no more .
she dismissed the first hotels she passed . she scarcely knew why , mainly perhaps from the mere dread of entering them . and crossed waterloo bridge at a leisurely pace . it was high afternoon , there was no great throng of foot passengers . and many an eye from omnibus and pavement rested gratefully on her fresh , trim presence as she passed young and erect .
a boy is an inverted man , small things seem to him great and great ones small . trifling troubles move him to tears and serious ones pass unnoticed . to snare a few worthless suckers in the meadow brook is to the country boy of more importance than the gathering of a field of grain . to play hooky and go nutting is far better than to study and fit himself for earning a livelihood . he works at his play and makes play of his work .
[female] donnithorne looked flushed and excited ; he had tried to make unpleasant feelings more bearable by drinking a little more wine than usual at dinner today . and was still enough under its flattering influence to think more lightly of this unwished for rencontre with [male] than he would otherwise have done . after all , [male] was the best person who could have happened to see him and hetty together . he was a sensible fellow , and would not babble about it to other people . [male] felt confident that he could laugh the thing off and explain it away .
this was a shallow [female] bowl in the center of which crouched on all fours a white . naked nymph , her small head intently drooped to the white flowers that floated on the [female] waters all around her . beside the pure [female] of the bowl her rusty plumes looked horrible . beside that white nymph , eternally innocent of all but the contemplation of beauty . her opaque skin and her suffering were offensive ; beside its air of being the coolly conceived and leisurely executed production of a hand and brain lifted by their rare quality to the service of the not absolutely necessary .
the incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at [male] sur [male] but the small portion of them which became known left such a memory in that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we did not narrate them in their most minute details . among these details the reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances . which we preserve out of respect for the truth . on the afternoon following the visit of javert . [male] madeleine went to see fantine according to his wont .
nor was it divided by numerous varnished partitions , according to the latest fashion . there were but three , the private entrance was in dean street , where a few swells came over from the theatre and called for brandies and sodas . there was a little mahogany what not on the counter , and esther served her customers between the little shelves . the public entrance and the jug and bottle entrance were in a side street . there was no parlour for special customers at the back .
researches in slang mean discoveries at every step . study and investigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point of intersection of regular society with society which is accursed . that the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever so low , that it can be dragged and pinioned there by obscure tyrannies of fatality . that it can be bound by no one knows what fetters in that abyss . is sufficient to create consternation , alas , will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness ?
it was a most lucky thing for me . that i heard their clothes catch in the brambles , and saw their hats under the rampart of ash . which is made by what we call `` splashing , '' and lucky , for me that i stood in a goyal . and had the dark coppice behind me . to this i had no time to fly , but with a sort of instinct .
he was intent only upon his plan . and did not take his eyes from the men over the fire . he came to the end of the [male] . and crouched with head and shoulders exposed , his revolver in his hand . suddenly a sound close to the tent startled him .
the following is the puerile and even silly event which decided the future life of this young girl . [female] happened to see in a bookseller 's window a lithographic portrait of one of her favorites , canalis . we all know what lies such pictures tell , -- being as they are the result of a shameless speculation . which seizes upon the personality of celebrated individuals as if their faces were public property . [female] began by securing the co operation of francoise cochet .
but , as the company kept arriving , [female] grew very restless , she could not talk of anything for two minutes together . but kept creeping out of the room and half-way down the stair , to look over the banister rail . and have a bird's eye peep of a portion of the great landing . where indeed she caught many a glimpse of beauty and state . but never a glimpse of her [female] , alas ! she could not even imagine herself near him .
all was not [female] in that human heart , the half effaced image of its maker was there still . and maud looked tenderly and penitently upon [female] and [female] , the former knelt by her side . and drawing the poor girl 's hands together across her breast as she lay upon the ground . lifted her own hands heavenward , moving her lips in prayer as she bent over the sufferer . what little maud knew of religious instruction , had been taught her in the form of the episcopal church .
if you had seen her radiant face as she raised it again in the excitement of speaking . if you had remembered what her surgeon had said of the penalty which she must inevitably pay for the recovery of her sight . how would you have answered her ? it is barely possible . perhaps , that you might have done what i did , that is to say . you might have modestly admitted that she knew what the conditions of her happiness were better than you .
the next morning , when archer got out of the fall river train . he emerged upon a steaming midsummer [female] . the streets near the station were full of the smell of beer and coffee and decaying fruit and a shirt sleeved populace moved through them with the intimate abandon of boarders going down the passage to the bathroom . archer found a cab and drove to the somerset club for breakfast . even the fashionable quarters had the air of untidy domesticity to which no excess of heat ever degrades the european cities .
the shield of the scot displayed his old bearing . the leopard , but with the addition of a collar and broken chain . in allusion to his late captivity , the shield of the marquis bore . in reference to his title , a serrated and rocky mountain . each shook his lance aloft , as if to ascertain the weight and toughness of the unwieldy weapon .
hither she had been led by two of her disguised ravishers . and on being thrust into the little cell , she found herself in the presence of an old sibyl . who kept murmuring to herself a saxon rhyme , as if to beat time to the revolving dance which her spindle was performing upon the floor . the hag raised her head as [female] entered . and scowled at the fair jewess with the malignant envy with which old age and ugliness .
railroad time inexorably wrenched them away from lovely . beloved [female] , the next morning , they were gone . they had seen the last of the long low parsonage home . half covered with china roses and pyracanthus -- more homelike than ever in the morning sun that glittered on its windows . each belonging to some well loved room , almost before they had settled themselves into the car .
this , then , was nuflo 's story , told not in nuflo 's manner . which was infinitely prolix ; and think not that it failed to move me -- that i failed to bless him for what he had done . in spite of his selfish motives , we were eighteen days travelling to riolama . on the last two making little progress , on account of continuous rain . which made [male] miserable beyond description , fortunately the dogs had found .
it was then as mrs. clavering had feared . indeed , from the first word that [female] had spoken on the present occasion . she had almost been sure of the facts , as they now were . to her father it would appear wonderful that his daughter should have come to love such a man as mr. [male] . but mrs. clavering knew better than he how far perseverance will go with women .
well , if you think you are going back to that horrid place again ... after what happened that night ? [female] wo not hear of it . if [organization] of medical experiment is not a respectable place you should make [male] resign as trustee . [male] is trustee of -- oh , nearly everything . that makes it all the worse , it is not as if you had to work .
his minute portions of [location] , and [male] . were to be repeated over to him , till he chose to say he knew them . and then he was to be helped to say them ; if he made mistakes in his little easy sums in arithmetic . they were to be shown him at once , and the sum done for him . instead of his being left to exercise his faculties in finding them out himself .
still she hesitated for a moment , turning her face away from him while he held her by the waist . she hesitated while she was weighing the meaning of his words . and taking them home to herself as her own , then she turned her neck towards him . still holding back her head till her face was immediately under his own , and after another moment 's pause she gave him her pledge as he had asked it . mrs. [female] 's words had come true , and the cherries had returned to her cheek .
each trip gave [female] new experiences . and traveling so much as we were , there were few outfits in the cattle country that knew the trails and the country as we did . and we were continually adding to this knowledge and experience . after returning from old man [male] 's in [location] we had to take the trail again with a herd of cattle for the spencer brothers . whose ranch was located just north of the red light about sixty five miles north of the bad lands in south dakota .
the ring was on her hand . the bishop 's benediction had been given , the bridesmaids were a poise to resume their place in the procession . and the organ was showing preliminary symptoms of breaking out into the [female] march . without which no newly wedded couple had ever emerged upon [location] , your arm . i say , give her your arm , young newland nervously hissed ; and once more archer became aware of having been adrift far off in the unknown .
job had reason to doubt if she fully understood him . for all this minuteness of detail , these satisfactory arrangements . as he considered them , only seemed to bring the circumstances in which she was placed more vividly home to [female] . they convinced her that it was real . and not all a dream , as she had sunk into fancying it for a few minutes .
but so it was , instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion . as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting . instead of remaining even for ever with her mother , and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study . as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on . she found herself at nineteen , submitting to new attachments .
he seemed somewhat surprised at the sum , but without any question or objection undertook the commission . and [male] would not lessen it , because unwilling to do more for the security of the luxurious mr harrel . than for the distresses of the laborious hills , nothing could be more speedy than the execution of this affair . mr harrel was diligent and expert , the whole was settled that morning . and , giving to the jew her bond for the payment at the interest he required .
as the dusk deepened , the great beacon cut swathes of light through it . sweeping in a circle over the fields and the harbor . the sandbar and the gulf , `` i feel as if it might catch me and whisk me leagues out to sea , '' said [female] , as one drenched them with radiance . and she felt rather relieved when they got so near the point that they were inside the range of those dazzling , recurrent flashes .
`` how do you do , colonel [male] ? '' she said quite simply . giving him her hand , there was nothing in the words . and yet he felt that he was very welcome , for when a woman really loves a man there is about her an atmosphere of softness and tender meaning which can scarcely be mistaken . sometimes it is only perceptible to the favoured individual himself . but more generally is to be discerned by any person of ordinary shrewdness , a very short course of observation in general society will convince the reader of the justice of this observation .
her hair was a graver matter , its tangled curls had never satisfied her . she tried all means to bring them into subjection . but the roll on top was ridiculous , and the roll behind was formal . she attempted long waves over the temples . it was impossible , with a lash comb she dragged her hair back to its natural lawlessness .
`` oh , certainly , '' said [male] , with his usual fluent nonchalance . he stayed an hour or so in conference with her . and rode back to [female] in a state of mind that was at once hopeful and busily anxious as to the execution of the little plan on which his hopefulness was based . [male] 's marriage to [male] would not . he believed , be much of a good to either of them , and it would plainly be fraught with disagreeables to himself .
captain , yes , strangely enough ; it must be , because the first supposition can not be proved . the latter can be , [female] , i believe you want to prove me guilty . so that you can get rid of me and then have absolute control over the child . but you wo not catch me in any such snare , captain . do you think that i would want to be responsible for another man 's child .
and the king , without waiting for the termination of the fireworks . turned towards the chateau , [male] accompanied him . and the whole court followed , leaving the remains of the fireworks consuming for their own amusement . the superintendent endeavored again to question [male] xiv. . but did not succeed in obtaining a reply , he imagined there had been some misunderstanding between [male] and [male] valliere in the park .
sir [male] sat by the library fire after breakfast upon this wretched rainy morning . writing letters and reading the newspapers , [female] herself in her own apartment to read the third volume of a novel . lady audley locked the door of the octagon ante chamber . and roamed up and down the suit of rooms from the bedroom to the boudoir all through that weary morning . she had locked the door to guard against the chance of any one coming in suddenly and observing her before she was aware .
and there came , echoing in her ears , [male] and his tender saralie . there was an oppression on her too , her very bedroom thrust on her her approaching marriage . this was her own furniture , for her new home , it was beautiful . simple and good , but she was not ready for marriage , she had been too close to the great struggle to be prepared to think in terms of [female] so soon . perhaps , had she dared to look deeper than that , she would have found something else .
mrs. [female] took colville home to dinner . mr. [male] was coming , she said , and he must come too . at table the young clergyman made her his compliment on her look of health . and she said , yes ; she had been driving , and she believed that she needed nothing but to be in the air a little more . as she very well could , now the spring weather was really coming .
she stopped , and was thankful not to see her husband returning . there was time to go back if she hurried , and she must hurry ! if he had seen her in her hammock , and made that theatrical attempt to play upon her feelings . he would laugh at his own success if she followed him . and if he had not seen her , and were in earnest .
when the timber thinned out kaskisoon picked his way with the caution of a lynx . at the edge of the clearing they crouched side by side behind a low windfall . and peered over the top , three hundred yards away was the nest , the man whose trail they had followed had disappeared . and then , suddenly , the door opened , and there poured out a crowd of excited men . the lone hunter was ahead of them .
this was just what she had been afraid he would say ; and yet she had no answer ready . of course she would have liked to take it as a joke . as her father must have meant it ; and yet she would have liked . also , in denying it , to be a little positive , a little sharp . so that he would perhaps not ask the question again , she did not like it .
a more plausible reason for putting discipleship out of the question was the strain of visionary excitement in [male] . which turned his wishes into overmastering impressions , and made him read outward facts as fulfillment . was such a temper of mind likely to accompany that wise estimate of consequences which is the only safeguard from fatal error . even to ennobling motive ? but it remained to be seen whether that rare conjunction existed or not in [male] . perhaps his might be one of the natures where a wise estimate of consequences is fused in the fires of that passionate belief which determines the consequences it believes in .
a creature not perhaps , if one would , exactly formed to inspire passions , since that always implied a certain silliness . but essentially seen , by the admiring eye of friendship , under the clear shadow of some probably eminent male interest . the clear shadow , from whatever source projected , hung , at any rate . over milly 's companion the whole week , and [female] croy 's handsome face smiled out of it . under bland skylights , in the presence alike of old masters passive in their glory and of thoroughly new ones .
well , i cleared away the ivy , and found the hole . it was large enough to receive the jar , and i thrust it deep in . in a tool shed at the bottom of the garden , lay the relics of building materials . left by masons lately employed to repair a part of the premises . i fetched thence a slate and some mortar .
[female] had now six shillings a week of regular and permanent wage . besides all harvest and shearing money , as well as a cottage rent free . and enough of garden ground to rear pot herbs for his wife and all his family . now the wages appointed by our justices , at the time of sessions . were four and sixpence a week for summer , and a shilling less for the winter time .
one incredible thing after another , known to her only in the past by rumour and description . and imagined in a frame of glory , was taking shape before her eyes ... she was in [location] ; she had slept in cheapside . she had talked with father campion ; he was with her now . this was the tower of [location] that lay before her .
[location] made no similar confession , he reflected deeply . however , over all that had passed , and came to the conclusion that , in glencore 's present condition . opposition might prejudice his chance of recovery . but never avail to turn him from his project , he also set himself to study the boy 's character . and found it , in all respects , the very type of his father 's .
saying good-bye to the princess , sergey ivanovitch was joined by [organization] . together they got into a carriage full to overflowing , and the train started . sergey ivanovitch advised him to go into the second class and talk to them himself . at the next station [organization] acted on this suggestion . at the first stop he moved into the second class and made the acquaintance of the volunteers .
at churchhill , however , i must remain till i have something better in view . my young lady accompanies me to town . where i shall deposit her under the care of miss summers . in wigmore street , till she becomes a little more reasonable , she will made good connections there . as the girls are all of the best families , the price is immense .
so piety demanded a new bonnet , or a new gown . and was barely satisfied with an easter pair of gloves . miss rose was generally very busy just before easter in hollingford . then this year there was the charity ball . ashcombe , hollingford , and coreham were three neighbouring towns .
fauchelevent , hardly able to draw his breath for trembling , seized his cold chisel and his hammer . and pried up the coffin lid , [male] face appeared in the twilight . it was pale and his eyes were closed , fauchelevent 's hair rose upright on his head . he sprang to his feet , then fell back against the side of the grave . ready to swoon on the coffin , he stared at [organization] .
striking , scratching , and other things may also be done during this kind of [organization] . the [organization] is practised only by unchaste and wanton women . female attendants and serving maids , i.e. , those who are not married to anybody . but who live by shampooing , the acharyas are of opinion that this [organization] is the work of a dog and not of a man . because it is a low practice , and opposed to the orders of the holy writ .
the spring being now too forward , a check to it was needful . and in the early part of march there came a change of weather . all the young growth was arrested by a dry wind from the east . which made both face and fingers burn when a man was doing ditching . the lilacs and the woodbines , just crowding forth in little tufts .
[female] became a chartist , a communist . all that is commonly called wild and visionary , ay ! but being visionary is something . it shows a soul , a being not altogether sensual ; a creature who looks forward for others . if not for himself , and with all his weakness he had a sort of practical power . which made him useful to the bodies of men to whom he belonged .
[female] was much too careless to be conscious of his sister 's danger . [male] had made an afternoon lounge of his rooms in the previous winter . it was no new thing for him to come there three or four times a week . and [male] did not for a moment suspect that clarissa 's occasional presence had anything to do with these visits . when the three portraits were finished , mr. [male] expressed himself highly content with them .
as yet , -- so she declared to herself now , -- the world had done but little for her . two old men had loved her ; one had become her husband , and the other had asked to become so . and to both she had done her duty , to both she had been grateful . tender , and self sacrificing , from the former she had . as his widow , taken wealth which she valued greatly .
jude almost tore his hair at having missed this letter till it was too late to act upon its contents . but he had chastened himself considerably of late , and at last his chimerical expedition to kennetbridge really did seem to have been another special intervention of providence to keep him away from temptation . but a growing impatience of faith , which he had noticed in himself more than once of late . made him pass over in ridicule the idea that god sent people on fools ', errands . he longed to see her ; he was angry at having missed her : and he wrote instantly .
humbly beseeching all noble lords and ladies , with all other estates of what estate or degree they been of . that shall see and read in this said book and work , that they take the good and honest acts in their remembrance . and to follow the same , wherein they shall find many joyous and [male] histories . and noble and renowned acts of humanity , gentleness , and chivalry . for herein may be seen noble chivalry , courtesy , humanity .
in every other respect , in looking around her , or penetrating forward , she saw more to distrust and to apprehend . she was concerned for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling . for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister . and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils , without knowing how to avert any one of them . she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him .
she did what she could to erect it into a law . a much more edifying aspect of it -- by going to live in [female] . where she bought a house and established herself . and by leaving her husband to take care of the english branch of his bank . this arrangement greatly pleased her ; it was so felicitously definite .
the baron continued to talk , now and then almost falling in the snow , but not permitting such slight mishaps to interrupt his discourse . which was addressed to nobody and had a general nature , touching upon dragons . marriages , crusades , and burgundy . could he have seen geoffrey 's more and more woe begone and distracted expression . he would have concluded his future son in law was suffering from some sudden and momentous bodily ill .
now , fair lady , said king [male] . what say ye ? most noble king , said [male] , wit you well that my lord . sir gareth , is to me more liefer to have and wield as my husband . than any king or prince that is christened ; and if i may not have him i promise you i will never have none . for , my lord [male] , said [male] .
so he started out to retrace his path , leaving the lady much chagrined . whose joy he had caused a while before . when he will not tarry longer she is the more distressed and ill at ease in proportion to the happiness he had brought to her . for she would have wished to honour him , and would have made him . with his consent , lord of all her possessions .
at the time when i stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones . i had just enough learning to be able to spell them out , my construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct . for i read `` wife of the above '' as a complimentary reference to my father 's exaltation to a better world . and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as `` below , '' i have no doubt i should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family .
`` well ; -- yes ; perhaps it was , '' said mr. [male] . who was thinking of his own flight the other night , and who among his special friends had been much praised for what he had then done . but of course he made no allusion to his own doings . or to those of mr. [male] , in this way they conversed for some twenty minutes . till they parted ; but neither of them interrogated the other as to what either might be called upon to do in consequence of the division which had just been effected .
to the noncommissioned officer 's excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk . the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind . [male] felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the executions . but which he had not felt during his imprisonment , now again controlled his existence . it was terrible , but he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him .
`` oh , it is really too late , '' said count orlov . looking at the camp , as often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our eyes . it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the sergeant was an impostor . that he had lied , and that the whole russian attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments . which he would lead away heaven only knew where , how could one capture a commander in chief from among such a mass of troops !
he drove his teal bug out of the garage . at thirty two minutes after twelve he was in his room . packing his wicker suitcase by the method of throwing things in and stamping on the case till it closed . in it he had absolutely all of his toilet refinements and wardrobe except the important portion already in use . they consisted , according to faithful detailed report , of four extra pairs of thick yellow and white cotton socks .
we are getting the most dreadful lessons in philosophy . all of [male] for tomorrow , the professor does not seem to realize that we are taking any other subject . he 's a queer old duck . he goes about with his head in the clouds and blinks dazedly when occasionally he strikes solid earth . he tries to lighten his lectures with an occasional witticism .
the sympathetic man still looked the other way , and wondered when she would recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again . he heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the breeze , and looked . she had gone away , with an air between that of tragedy and comedy [male] returned to his work . as the milking hour drew near , oak kept his usual watch upon the cowshed . at last he felt cold , and shaking an extra quantity of bedding round the yearling ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon the stove .
troy did not awake from his comfortless sleep till it was broad day . not having been in bed for two nights his shoulders felt stiff . his feet tender , and his head heavy . he remembered his position , arose , shivered , took the spade . and again went out , the rain had quite ceased , and the sun was shining through the green .
and then came into the field sir perimones . the red knight , sir persant 's brother . that was a knight of the castle , and he encountered with sir ector [male] . and either smote other so hard that both their horses and they fell to the earth . and then came in the red knight of the red launds , and sir gareth .
he had known her hysterical -- it was one of her aspects with which he had no concern . and yet these tears touched him as something unusual . they were nearer the things that did concern him . such as music , he laid down his knife and looked at her curiously . then , as she continued to sob , he went on with his lunch .
why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak french . and the next english ; why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano . the sounds of which were audible in their brother 's room above . where the students used to work ; why they were visited by those professors of french literature . of music , of drawing , of dancing ; why at certain hours all the three young ladies .
yet as we stand at night in the great hall . removing our garments for sleep , we look upon our brothers and we wonder . the heads of our brothers are bowed , the eyes of our brothers are dull . and never do they look one another in the eyes , the shoulders of our brothers are hunched . and their muscles are drawn , as if their bodies were shrinking and wished to shrink out of sight .
i patted him gently , and he proceeded at once to march along beside me with an air of satisfaction unspeakable . a very old woman , who had been the housekeeper of the former cure . also came to meet us , and after having invited me into a little back parlour . asked whether i intended to retain her , i replied that i would take care of her . and the dog , and the chickens , and all the furniture her master had bequeathed her at his death .
hence there is in the neighbourhood of these breakers a certain accentuation of storms . it must be borne in mind that the wind is composite . the wind is believed to be simple ; but it is by no means simple . its power is not merely dynamic , it is chemical also ; but this is not all . it is magnetic , its effects are often inexplicable , the wind is as much electrical as aerial .
she went into this room , it was empty . and the murmur of voices came from the adjoining chamber . the door between the two rooms was open , and she heard something more than voices . there was the sound of low convulsive sobbing ; very subdued , but very terrible to hear . she could not see the sick man , for there was a little group about his bed .
there might be about twenty gentlemen in the room , including some by courtesy . who were not immediately concerned in the settlement of the present question ; but who . nevertheless , were sufficiently interested to attend , these were divided into little groups , who did not seem by any means unanimous . some were for a slight concession , just a sugar plum to quieten the naughty child . a sacrifice to [male] and quietness , some were steadily and vehemently opposed to the dangerous precedent of yielding one jot or one tittle to the outward force of a turn-out .
the said noble gentlemen instantly required me to imprint the history of the said noble king and conqueror king [male] . and of his knights , with the history of the saint greal . and of the death and ending of the said [male] ; affirming that i ought rather to imprint his acts and noble feats . than of [male] of boloine , or any of the other eight , considering that he was a man born within this realm . and king and emperor of the same : and that there be in french divers and many noble volumes of his acts .
he looked at the leases again and the letter attached . there was no doubt that he had lost his houses by an accident which might easily have been circumvented if he had known the true conditions of his holding . the time for performance had now lapsed in strict law . but might not the intention be considered by the landholder when she became aware of the circumstances . and his moral right to retain the holdings for the term of his life be conceded ?
she moved quietly , but deadly efficiency , and in three quarters of an hour her trunk was locked and strapped and she was fully dressed in a becoming new travelling suit that marjorie had helped her pick out . sitting down at her desk she wrote a short note to mrs. [female] . in which she briefly outlined her reasons for going , she sealed it . addressed it , and laid it on her pillow . she glanced at her watch , the train left at one .
he put the roses in his breast and they walked on for a little while . slowly and silently , under the umbrageous trees , then he asked her . in a voice of cheerful kindness , was there anything else that she would say to him as her friend and her father 's friend . many years older than herself ; was there any trust she would repose in him . any service she would ask of him .
he was one who trafficked greatly in disputed inheritances ; it was his way to buy out the most unlikely claimant . and then , by the favour he curried with great lords about the king . procure unjust decisions in his favour . or , if that was too roundabout , to seize the disputed manor by force of arms . and rely on his influence and sir [male] 's cunning in the law to hold what he had snatched .
it was years afterwards that she used to talk like this to mrs. [female] . and to mrs. [female] alone , nobody else ever heard the story from her lips . but it was never forgotten , it was always felt ; it remained like a mark on her soul . a sort of mystic wound , to be contemplated , to be meditated over , and she said further to mrs. [female] . in the course of many confidences provoked by that contemplation .
the leak was staunched , but nothing could be more precarious , those sharp splinters of the gap which fixed the tarpaulin might pierce it and make holes . by which the water would enter ; while he would not even perceive it in the darkness . there was little probability of the stoppage lasting until daylight . [male] 's anxiety changed its form . but he felt it increasing at the same time that he found his strength leaving him .
half an hour had perhaps elapsed since the carter had perceived this vessel . when a plasterer returning from his work in the town . and passing round pelee pool . found himself suddenly opposite a vessel sailing boldly among the rocks of the quenon . the rousse [male] mer .
thinking that , after all , he should lose nothing , [male] promised himself to ask her in marriage as soon as occasion offered . but each time such occasion did offer the fear of not finding the right words sealed his lips . old rouault would not have been sorry to be rid of his daughter , who was of no use to him in the house . in his heart he excused her . thinking her too clever for farming , a calling under the ban of heaven , since one never saw a millionaire in it .
marriage arising out of her torture ; this gilliatt . the evil destiny of last night , become today her saviour ! she could explain nothing to her own mind . it was evident that all the morning gilliatt had had no other occupation than that of preparing the way for their marriage . he had done all : he had answered for mess lethierry .
he will want you or [male] to keep the accounts . if any are kept , he will be slow in getting you glasses of water at the railway stations . and will always keep you waiting at breakfast , i hold that a man with two ladies on a tour should be an absolute slave to them . or they will not fully enjoy themselves , he should simply be an upper servant . with the privilege of sitting at the same table with his mistresses .
there had been an autumn storm of wind and rain . lasting for three days , thunderous had been the crash of billows on the rocks . wild the white spray and spume that blew over the bar . troubled and misty and tempest torn the erstwhile blue [male] of four winds harbor . now it was over , and the shore lay clean washed after the storm .
the next morning shone bright and clear . if ever a march morning did , the beguiling month was coming in like a lamb . with whatever storms it might go raging out , it was long since [male] had tasted the freshness of the early air on the shore . or in the country , as his employment at the shop detained him in monkshaven till the evening . and as he turned down the quays on the north side of the river .
his eyes were dim ; his breast heaved ; his voice shook . [female] was weeping from excitement , through the tears she saw them all looking at their leader . and in the worn , hard faces glowed the affection and admiration of a dog for its master . something there was especially touching in this , for strong men rarely show it . she felt a great wave of excitement sweep over her .
maud received my report with obvious relief . and the sight of smoke which later rose in the galley put her in a more cheerful mood . the next day , and the next , we saw the galley smoke rising . and sometimes we caught glimpses of him on the poop . but that was all , he made no attempt to come ashore , this we knew .
[female] stood a dozen steps behind them when [female] turned . she greeted him with a smile . and hastened to assist [male] in gathering up the things about the camp . [female] was not blind to her efforts to evade him . he could see that it was a relief to her when they were at last in [male] 's canoe .
near the port stood a mammoth sawmill capable of taking care of twenty two million feet a year . about which a lumber town had sprung up , lake schooners lay in a long row during the summer months . while busy loaders passed the planks from one to the other into the deep holds . besides its original holding , the company had acquired about a hundred and fifty million more . back near the headwaters of tributaries to the ossawinamakee .
a nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows . if it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of the upper life . it is probable that we should behold the forms of night . the winged unknowns , the blue passers of the invisible , bend down , a throng of sombre heads . around the luminous house , satisfied , showering benedictions , pointing out to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed .
this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory , and decided the whole business at once . each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement , and saw nothing . therefore , but good manners in the other ; and with regard to the gentlemen . there was such an hearty good humour , such an open , trusting liberality on the admiral 's side . as could not but influence sir [male] .
if he had needed confirmation of his suspicions . it lay to his hand , but the situation had changed over night . there would be a search for clark now , as wide as the knowledge of his disappearance . local police authorities would turn him up in every city from maine to the pacific coast . even [location] would be on the lookout and south [male] .
and the golden echo carried his voice up into the high dome . and it died away in whispers of music . but ustad isa standing far off in the throng ( for what are craftsmen in the presence of the mighty ? ) , said softly in his beard , it was love also that built . and therefore it shall endure , now it is told that , on a certain night in summer .
for a moment loder said nothing . not daring to trust his voice ; then he answered , low and abruptly , now ! ', he said . `` now , at once , now , this moment , if i may , and -- and remember that i know what it costs you . '' as if imbued with fear that his courage might fail him . he suddenly released her hand .
the journey was a great deal longer to [male] around the southern hills . and enter by the doone gate , than to cross the lower land and steal in by the water slide . however , i durst not take a horse ( for fear of the doones who might be abroad upon their usual business ) . but started betimes in the evening , so as not to hurry , or waste any strength upon the way . and thus i came to the robbers highway , walking circumspectly , scanning the sky line of every hill .
the beast , recovering from his shock against the wooden bars . looked wistfully at his last retreating enemy , as he still struggled amidst the bushes . he looked at the ditch and at the broken hedge . but he did not understand how weak were the impediments in his way . he had knocked his head against the stout timber .
the aspects dwindled out in a cries cross of blotted lines in the very middle of a sentence . and suggested that the author had been interrupted , or convinced of the futility of proceeding . with her pen in the air ... oh , yes , [female] had come in at that point . she scored that sheet very effectively , and , choosing a fresh one , began at a great rate with a generalization upon the structure of human society . which was a good deal bolder than her custom .
now this may seem very strange to [female] who live in a better and purer age . or say at least that we do so -- and yet who are we to condemn our fathers for teaching [male] better manners . and at their own expense ? with these points any virtuous man is bound to deal quite tenderly . making allowance for corruption , and not being too sure of himself . and to tell the truth , although i had seen so little of the world as yet .
his business was in a narrow compass , and his income sufficient to a plentiful way of living in the ordinary way . i do not say to keep an equipage , and make a figure , as the world calls it . nor did i expect it , or desire it ; for as i abhorred the levity and extravagance of my former life . so i chose now to live retired , frugal , and within ourselves , i kept no company . made no visits ; minded my family , and obliged my husband .
she stared at him , bewildered , amazement , disbelief . and anger flowing in quick waves across her face . the three men held their breaths , moreland , senior . took a step toward her ; mr. [male] 's mouth dropped a little open as he waited . panic stricken , for the expected crash , but it did not come , [female] 's face became suddenly radiant .
gentlemen of the human race , i tell you . not a bit of it , it is at [location] that the most beer is consumed . at [location] the most brandy , at madrid the most chocolate , at amsterdam the most gin . at [location] the most wine , at constantinople the most coffee , at [location] the most absinthe . there are all the useful notions , [location] carries the day , in short .
written for inscription on a clock -- one of the grandest of small poems . her father knew next to nothing of literature . having pondered his new testament , however , for thirty years , he was capable of understanding [male] 's best . to the childlike mind the best is always simplest and easiest not unfrequently the only kind it can lay hold of . when she ended , he made her read it again .
`` ay , that will i , '' said [female] , returning the pressure . from that day forwards mrs. [female] became more and more of a suffering invalid . it was now drawing near to the anniversary of [female] 's marriage . and looking back upon the year 's accumulated heap of troubles . [female] wondered how they had been borne , if she could have anticipated them .
it seemed to him that he had been lying there for years . lost in a labyrinth of demented fancies , looking back at that time . now that his reason had been restored to him , he was able to recall his delusions one by one . and it was very difficult for him to understand , even now , that they were all utterly groundless . the mere vagabondage of a wandering brain .
yet he was a very [male] lad to look upon . smooth faced and gallant , mounted and dressed in a manner that should give any lad joy . he wore great gauntlets on his hands . he was in his habit of green ; he had his steel buckled leather belt upon him beneath his cloak and a pair of daggers in it . with his long sword looped up ; he had his felt hat on his head .
phineas was fond of such discussions and fond of holding them with mr. [male] . in this matter fluttering like a moth round a candle . he would not perceive that as he had made up his mind to be a servant of the public in parliament . he must abandon all idea of independent action . and unless he did so he could be neither successful as regarded himself .
this was the wildest bit of landscape about arden . and clarissa loved it with all an artist 's love . she had sketched that belt of fir trees under almost every condition . with the evening sun behind them . standing blackly out against the warm crimson light ; or later , when the day had left no more than a faint opal glimmer in the western sky .
he had seen them in the sun . but never as they revealed themselves now in that cabin lamp glow . he scarcely looked atpierre , who was on his feet , looking down upon her . not untilpierre reached out and crumpled the smothering mass of glowing tresses in his big hands , and laughed . it was a laugh filled with the unutterable joy of possession .
what it was , whether beast or human being , one could not , at first sight . tell : it grovelled , seemingly , on all fours . it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal : but it was covered with clothing . and a quantity of dark , grizzled hair . wild as a mane , hid its head and face .
ought he to hold his [male] ? he could not manage to see anything distinctly . the vague aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by his meditations quivered and vanished . one after the other , into smoke , he only felt that , to whatever course of action he made up his mind . something in him must die , and that of necessity . and without his being able to escape the fact ; that he was entering a sepulchre on the right hand as much as on the left .
having ended his oration , much to his own satisfaction , [male] tossed off his glass of wine . smacked his lips , wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . pocketed his cake , and made off , it seemed to be sylvia 's fate to captivate more people than she cared to like back again . she turned the heads of [male] and [male] foster . who could hardly congratulate [male] enough on his choice of a wife .
the messenger watched me , while i read so much as i could read of it . and he seemed well pleased with my surprise , because he had expected it . then , not knowing what else to do , i looked again at the cover . and on the top of it i saw , ride , ride , ride ! on his gracious majesty 's business ; spur and spare not .
half an hour later , when archer unlocked his own front door . he found a similar envelope on the hall table on top of his pile of notes and letters . the message inside the envelope was also from may welland , and ran as follows . `` parents consent wedding tuesday after easter at twelve [male] church eight bridesmaids please see rector so happy love may . '' archer crumpled up the yellow sheet as if the gesture could annihilate the news it contained .
prince [male] bowed his head in token of having understood from the first not only what had been said but also what kutuzov would have liked to tell him . he gathered up the papers and with a bow to both . stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room , though not much time had passed since prince [male] had left [location] . he had changed greatly during that period , in the expression of his face . in his movements , in his walk , scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence .
`` oh , pray be assured of that , '' franz took his hat and went away in haste . he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to [male] him at two o'clock . fortunately the palazzo bracciano , which is on one side in the corso . and on the other in the square of the holy apostles . is hardly ten minutes walk from the hotel [male] londres .
here i left my guides , and , slipping to the nearest window . sought for an avenue of escape , the windows opened upon a great balcony which overlooked one of the broad avenues of zodanga . the ground was about thirty feet below , and at a like distance from the building was a wall fully twenty feet high . constructed of polished glass about a foot in thickness . to a red martian escape by this path would have appeared impossible , but to me .
`` yas , i am here an '' i am myself , i reckon . who would ye think i be ? he caught her and kissed her . and , with his arm about her , entered the cabin . his mood changed with childish ease according to whatever the moments brought him . cassandra lighted a candle , for now that the days had grown warm .
there were some who made their escape by a back door , and ascended to the third story on the rue droit mur side . in order to attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps , impossible ! one even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating , and to wave her white handkerchief . two were still bolder , they found means to climb on a roof . and risked their lives there , and succeeded at last in seeing `` the young man . ''
the footsteps of [female] behind them reminded them now and then that he was there . they were deeply moved , but could find no words , the excess of emotion results in stupor . theirs was delightful , but overwhelming , they were man and wife . every other idea was postponed to that , what [male] had done was well ; that was all that they could grasp . they experienced towards their guide a deep but vague gratitude in their hearts .
whilst this order was being executed , [male] reappeared upon the deck . and took a seat near the bastingage , night had fallen . the moon had not yet risen , yet [male] looked incessantly towards [male] . [male] then approached the captain , who had returned to take his post in the stern . and said , in a low and humble voice , `` what course are we to follow , captain ? ''
but i was deeply anxious to save ustane , whom i liked and respected . from the dire fate that overshadowed her at the hands of her mighty rival . so i made one more appeal , well pleased to have succeeded even to this extent . i passed out into the passage and called to ustane , whose white garment i caught sight of some yards away . huddled up against one of the earthenware lamps that were placed at intervals along the tunnel .
after his entrance , lord [male] did not attempt once to resume his seat . but having bowed most respectfully to all present , he took his leave ; while miss milner followed him as far as the door . and repeated her thanks for his protection , lord elmwood was hurt beyond measure . but he had a second concern , which was , that he had not the power to conceal how much he was affected . he trembled -- when he attempted to speak , he stammered .
in that month of may durrance lifted his eyes from wadi halfa and began eagerly to look homeward . but in the contrary direction , five hundred miles to the south of his frontier town . on the other side of the great nubian desert and the belly of stones . the events of real importance to him were occurring without his knowledge . on the deserted track between berber and suakin the wells of obak are sunk deep amongst mounds of shifting sand .
the debate on the second reading of the bill was to be commenced on the 1st of march . and two days before that lady [female] arrived in grosvenor place . [female] got a note from her in three words to say that she was at home and would see him if he called on sunday afternoon . the sunday to which she alluded was the last day of february . [male] was now more certain than ever that something was wrong , had there been nothing wrong between lady [female] and her husband .
i have got your letter this moment . of course we must meet , i hunt on tuesday . and go down by the early train ; but i will come to town on wednesday . we shall require to be private , and i will therefore be at your rooms at one o'clock on that day. , c . [male] at once perceived that the note was a hostile note .
somewhere in the fog of the ancient hells . there is a tun like that , is not one pardonable , if one at last refuses ! can the inexhaustible have any right ? are not chains which are endless above human strength ? who would blame sisyphus and [male] for saying : `` it is enough , '' the obedience of matter is limited by friction . is there no limit to the obedience of the soul ?
she drove about with her two-year-old son , showing him the wonders and glories of the place as fondly as if its classic associations had been within the compass of his budding mind . she went on with her art studies with renewed vigour . as if there had been a raffaelle fever in the very air of the place . and made plans for copying half the pictures in the vatican , there was plenty of agreeable society in the city . english and foreign ; and clarissa found herself almost as much in request as she had been in [location] .
the fire was lighted , and [female] sat down in front of it . restless as the last leaf upon a tree , a sort of sorrow in her face . as if she reproached her own soul . ', poor [female] . how [male] 's frame must be pulsing under the conditions of which he had just heard the caricature . how her fair temples must ache ; what a mood of wretchedness she must be in !
it was a pleasure to touch anything . especially anything alive , she even noticed that the elm trees were strangely tall and still against the calm sky . and the rich odour of some carnations which came through the bushes from the pleasure ground excited her . the scent of earth and leaves tingled in her . and the cawing of the rooks coming home took her soul away skyward in an exquisite longing .
the doctor stumbled upstairs by the fire light , and met the awe struck look of the neighbour . which at once told him the state of things . the room was still , as he , with habitual tiptoe step . approached the poor frail body , that nothing now could more disturb . her daughter knelt by the bedside .
no more shells fell , at dawn , with all done that could be done . [female] fainted quietly in the hallway , [female] carried her in and placed her on her bed . a corner of the room was indeed gone , the mantel was shattered and the little stove . but on the floor lay harvey 's photograph uninjured . [male] lifted it and looked at it .
in carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the barber . who took it up , curious to know whose it was , and found it said . `` history of the famous knight , tirante [organization] . '' `` god bless me , '' said the curate with a shout . `` 'tirante [organization] '' here , hand it over .
the idea grows coarse as we handle it . and hardens in our grasp , but , if the spectator broods long over the statue . he will be conscious of its spell ; all the pleasantness of sylvan life . all the genial and happy characteristics of creatures that dwell in woods and fields . will seem to be mingled and kneaded into one substance , along with the kindred qualities in the human soul .
darya alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he grew confused . and she did not quite understand this digression , but she felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart . of which he could not speak to [male] , he was now making a clean breast of everything . and that the question of his pursuits in the country fell into the same category of matters near his heart . as the question of his relations with [female] .
he recalled stories of catalepsy . the marvels of magnetism , and he said to himself that by willing it with all his force he might perhaps succeed in reviving her . once he even bent towards he . and cried in a low voice , `` emma , emma ! '' his strong breathing made the flames of the candles tremble against the wall .
it was now the middle of november . and yet , as [female] passed along , never to her , did the sun shine so bright as upon this morning . never did her imagination comprehend . that the human heart could feel happiness true and genuine as hers , on arriving at the house . there was no abatement of her felicity : all was respect and duty on the part of the domestics .
in the first , men are bound only with chains ; in the other , chained by faith . what flowed from the first ? an immense curse , the gnashing of teeth . hatred , desperate viciousness , a cry of rage against human society . a sarcasm against heaven , and in these two places . so similar yet so unlike , these two species of beings who were so very unlike .
a white church could be seen through the mist , and here and there the roofs of huts in borodino as well as dense masses of soldiers . or green ammunition chests and ordnance . and all this moved , or seemed to move , as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space . just as in the mist enveloped hollow near borodino , so along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the left . in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground .
i listened before i went to open it , for it was nearly twelve o'clock at night . and i was in no mood to admit any stranger . i had but one friend in the college . or , indeed , in the world -- perhaps it was he . just then the person outside the door coughed , and i hastened to open it .
he should not have chosen , he said , to have made any change till after the trial was over . even had any change been permitted , when he was brought up the steps into the dock after the judges had taken their seats there was almost a shout of applause . the crier was very angry , and gave it to be understood that everybody would be arrested unless everybody was silent . but the chief justice said not a word , nor did those great men the attorney and solicitor general express any displeasure . the bench was again crowded with members of parliament from both houses .
why had not [male] himself spoken of the speciality of her beauty ? no man in england knew better than the archdeacon the difference between beauty of one kind and beauty of another kind in a woman 's face . the one beauty , which comes from health and youth and animal spirits . and which belongs to the [female] 's daughter , and the other beauty . which shows itself in fine lines and a noble spirit .
to attain one 's ends in this way is the consummate triumph of art . never to appear as a factor in the situation ; to be able to wield other men . as instruments , with the same direct and implicit response to will that one gets from a hand or a foot . this is to triumph , indeed : to be as nearly controller and conqueror of fates as fate permits . there have been men prominent in the world 's affairs at one time and another .
he had not given other girls a fair chance . but had thrown himself down at the feet of this [male] female in the weakest possible manner . and then it got about the town that he had been refused over and over again by [female] rowley . it is too probable that lady rowley in her despair and dismay had been indiscreet . and had told secrets which should never have been mentioned by her , and the wife of the english minister .
[male] could not help the feeling that he was away off on the edge . and that his arrival had put a rein on the spirits of these men . mainly they were young men like himself . two or three of them only betrayed by gray in beards and hair . brown , sinewy , lean jawed men , no dissipation showing in their eyes .
as for upton , it was the triumph of his manner to deal with men separated widely from himself in station and abilities . he could throw such an air of good fellowship into the smallest attentions . impart such a glow of kindliness to the veriest commonplaces . that the very craftiest and shrewdest could never detect , as he leaned his arm . therefore , on stubber 's shoulder , and smiled benignly on him .
for the first time in the history of the country a woman was sovereign . for the first time there had been no direct male heir to the throne . with the death of old prince ganlook the masculine side of the illustrious family ended . no matter whom his daughter took for a husband . the line was broken , why not the bold , progressive , rich american ? argued some .
he turned [male] all out of the room . and shut the door , how he told her that which was necessary she should know . that which [male] himself had told [male] this very morning . how the father and mother had borne this first open revelation of their unutterable grief . for ever remained unknown , i was sitting by muriel 's bed .
sometimes , when in a very complacent mood , he would go a birds nesting with the children , a thing that irritated and annoyed me exceedingly . as , by frequent and persevering attempts , i flattered myself i had partly shown them the evil of this pastime . and hoped , in time , to bring them to some general sense of justice and humanity . but ten minutes birds nesting with uncle [male] .
when he heard of the time that had elapsed without any discovery of the slightest trace of the fugitive . he looked grave ; and declared , honestly enough , that he doubted if he could reward my confidence in him by proving himself to be of the slightest service to me . seeing , however , that i was earnestly bent on making some sort of effort . he put a last question to me in these terms , you have not described the gentleman yet , is there , by lucky chance .
it was a misfortune to him . trifle as it might have been to another , for , while all that was hard and stern in his recollection . remained reality on being proved -- was obdurate to the sight and touch . and relaxed nothing of its old indomitable grimness -- the one tender recollection of his experience would not bear the same test . and melted away , he had foreseen this , on the former night , when he had dreamed with waking eyes .
that same night master [male] ( of whose absence the counsellor must have known ) . came back , with all equipment ready for the grand attack . now the doones knew , quite as well as we did , that this attack was threatening . and that but for the wonderful weather it would have been made long ago , therefore we . or at least our people , were sure to meet with a good resistance , and due preparation .
no one at the present moment was more clear than was [male] as to the necessity of purity at elections . not a penny had been misspent by the finnites , a vote or two from their score was knocked off on grounds which did not touch the candidate or his agents . one man had personated a vote , but this appeared to have been done at the instigation of some very cunning [male] partisan . another man had been wrongly described , this , however , amounted to nothing , [male] finn was seated for the borough . and the judge declared his purpose of recommending [organization] to issue a commission with reference to the expediency of instituting a prosecution .
he saw it as a place where you had to work hard just to live . where busy policemen despised you because you did not know which trolley to take . where it was incredibly hard to remember even the names of the unceasing streets . where the conductors said `` step lively , '' and there was no room to whistle . no time to swap stories with a bill mcgolwey at an old home lunch counter .
i went upstairs again , and found that miss [female] proposed , during the forenoon . to go and find the eye hospital , where she was to see the oculist . and arrange for him to visit her . and shortly after eleven we set out , the street that i had so dimly seen the night before . showed itself by daylight to be a fair , broad way .
more than anyone else , prince vasili took possession of [male] 's affairs and of [male] himself in those early days . from the death of count bezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad . he had the air of a man oppressed by business . weary and suffering , who yet would not , for pity 's sake . leave this helpless youth who , after all , was the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth .
the king became perfectly livid ; a lightning flash seemed to dart from his eyes . [male] felt that he was lost , but he as not one to shrink when the voice of honor spoke loudly within him . he bore the king 's wrathful gaze . the latter swallowed his rage , and after a few moments silence , said , `` are we going to return to [male] ? ''
`` you persist in that farce ? '' i demanded . wheeling round upon her , she did not answer , only stared back without flinching . i realised that here was a will not easily overcome , `` very well , '' i said quietly at last . `` i shall get along , then , in spite of you , '' and i returned to my inspection of the room . there was a writing desk in one corner , with pens .
whose was it , and to what was it to lead ? it could not be his wife 's . he had heard her simple account of her youth . and had believed it as he had believed in the gospel . she had told him a very brief story of an early orphanage . and a long , quiet , colorless youth spent in the conventional seclusion of an english boarding school .
i was greatly interested in watching the effect which these disclosures produced on oscar . my observation led me to form two conclusions . first conclusion , that time and absence had not produced the slightest change in the love which the poor fellow bore to lucilla . second conclusion , that nothing but absolute proof would induce him to agree in my unfavorable opinion of his brother 's character . it was in vain i declared that nugent had quitted england pledged to find him .
so , as the time of the evening prayer drew nigh . a child was born , and the empress , having done with pain . began to sink slowly into that profound sleep that is the shadow cast by the last . may [female] the upholder have mercy on our weakness ! and the women , white with fear and watching .
`` i am not easily alarmed , '' i returned , trying hard to keep out of my voice anything save the indifferent courtesy which one would bestow upon a stranger . for the atmosphere of mystery seemed deepening about this stranger and me . i did not believe he had spoken the truth , when he said that my utterance of my maiden name . in response to his question , had nothing to do with his faintness . i was as certain as i was of anything that it was the utterance of that name .
the steamer had not yet cast off , as usual , it was to take a flying start from the harbor . for it was just outside the harbor that the wolves of the sea lay in wait . [male] , alone at last , opened his letter , and stood staring at it . there was again movement behind the german line , a matter to be looked into . as only he could do it , probably nothing , as before .
i might , perhaps , have been a little astonished at this extraordinary absence of all self assertion on mr. [male] 's part . in the character of guardian , if my knowledge of the family affairs had not been sufficient to remind me that he was a single man . and that he had nothing more than a life interest in the limmeridge property . as matters stood , therefore , i was neither surprised nor disappointed at the result of the interview . mr. [male] had simply justified my expectations .
after he had been with her three or four times it struck him that to have come at last into her house had had the horrid effect of diminishing their intimacy . he had known her better , had liked her in greater freedom . when they merely walked together or kneeled together , now they only pretended ; before they had been nobly sincere . they began to try their walks again , but it proved a lame imitation . for these things , from the first , beginning or ending , had been connected with their visits to the church .
clarissa remembered the old kitchen gardens at the court in her father 's time . when the whole extent of `` glass '' was comprised by a couple of dilapidated cucumber frames . and a queer little greenhouse in a corner . where she and her brother had made some primitive experiments in horticulture . and where there was a particular race of spiders , the biggest specimens of the spidery species it had ever been her horror to encounter .
[male] , how sir [male] at the request of a lady recovered a falcon . by which he was deceived , chapter xvii . how sir [male] overtook a [male] which chased his wife to have slain her . and how he said to him , so pedivere departed with the dead lady and the head . and found the queen with king [male] at winchester .
in the midst of their confusion [male] entered . and they immediately gave up to him the task of restoring her . this he soon did , for it would seem that his very voice had a power to recall [female] 's suspended faculties . slowly her eyes unclosed ; then , as if wearied out , she again closed them . and for a time slept sweetly , calmly , on [female] 's bosom .
in his confused memory of the situation he seemed not to have been guiltless of such yearnings ... yet for the first few days the experiment had been perfectly successful , her enjoyment had been unclouded and his pleasure in it undisturbed . it was very gradually -- he seemed to see -- that a shade of lassitude had crept over their intercourse . perhaps it was because , when her light chatter about people failed . he found she had no other fund to draw on .
her so brief romantic dream was ended , the glorious world of fancy which in the last hour she had built with such elaborate detail . over which it should be her exalted destiny to rule , lay shattered about her feet . its debris so many stumbling blocks that prevented her from winning back to her erstwhile content in scaramouche as he really was . andre louis sat in the window embrasure . smoking and looking idly out across the river , he was intrigued and meditative .
in the library at the old manse that afternoon there was less of sunlight and joy . shadows hung between the walls and there were shadows . too , in the heart of one of the men who sat by a central , paper littered table . it was at best a cheerless room . this study where the minister had for decades prepared the messages of his stewardship .
what had i , [organization] 's widow . to do with this trumpery family entanglement , nothing ! it was a warm day for the time of year . [organization] 's widow , like a wise woman . determined to make herself comfortable , she unlocked her packed box .
`` leave me to pray , '' the count withdrew without opposition . but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of [male] . who at length arose , brushed the dust from his knees . and turned towards [location] , without once looking back , he walked slowly down the rue [male] roquette . the count , dismissing his carriage , followed him about a hundred paces behind .
this reputation for ability mingled harmoniously with his fame for perfect simplicity of character . great simplicity and great talents in conjunction are not uncommon . the compound constitutes one of the varieties of the virtuous man . and one of the most valuable , [male] was one of those men who might be found in intimate conversation with a sharper or a thief . without suffering any diminution of respect in the minds of their neighbours .
she fell silent in spite of herself as they approached the gates . and when her husband said , `` here we are at home ! '' and for the first time kissed her on the lips . she hardly knew of it : it was no more than the passive acceptance of a greeting in the midst of an absorbing show . was not all her hurrying life of the last three months a show .
even mrs. arbuthnot looked at her now , and in her gentlest voice said they would be late for lunch . it was at this point that mrs. [female] asked for references . she had no wish to find herself shut up for four weeks with somebody who saw things . it is true that there were three sitting rooms , besides the garden and the battlements at [location] . so that there would be opportunities of withdrawal from mrs. wilkins .
and thus the course of love was not all smooth to our [male] . it was still [male] for him when he was there on the croquet ground . or sitting in mrs [female] 's drawing room with all the privileges of an accepted lover . it was [male] to him also as he sipped the squire 's claret . knowing that his coffee would soon be handed to him by a sweet girl who would have tripped across the two gardens on purpose to perform for him this service .
there is also a fifth kind of kiss called the `` greatly pressed kiss , '' which is effected by taking hold of the lower lip between two fingers . and then after touching it with the tongue , pressing it with great force with the lip . as regards kissing , a wager may be laid as to which will get hold of the lips of the other first . if the woman loses , she should pretend to cry , should keep her lover off by shaking her hands .
nothing was said to [female] about her sins on that afternoon after her uncle had started on his journey . everything in the hotel was blank , and sad , and gloomy . but there was , at any rate , the negative comfort of silence . and [female] was allowed to go about the house and do her work without rebuke . but she observed that the cure -- [female] le cure gondin .
she had not been so keen about it , at first , but leslie was like a madman . he was so pleased that he was ordering her that sable cape she had wanted so . he was like a different man , and it would be july . [female] kissed her , it seemed very unreal . like everything else , she wondered why leslie should be so excited .
if he could save her she should never know one pain . one grief , one hurt , he had been so right all his life . so constant in his kindness and his goodness , and this was his last passionate righteousness . his love for the child [male] . some things troubled him yet , the world had passed away from him .
it was settled that mr. [male] should not go again into the school . or mrs. [female] among the boys . till he should have gone to [male] and have come back , it was explained in the school by the doctor early . for the doctor must now take the morning school himself . that circumstances of very grave import made it necessary that mr. [male] should start at once for [male] .
switching on the light in the nursery , she found julie tossing feverishly and giving out odd little cries . she put her hand against the cheeks . they were burning , with an exclamation she followed the arm down under the cover until she found the hand . [female] was right , the whole thumb was swollen to the wrist and in the centre was a little inflamed sore , blood poisoning ! her mind cried in terror , the bandage had come off the cut and she would gotten something in it .
she felt that this matter must be inquired into at once , and not allowed to go too far . she had ruled slowbridge too long to allow such innovations to remain uninvestigated , she would not be likely to be upset , ', at least . she descended from her landau , with her most rigorous air . her stout , rich [female] moire antique gown rustled severely . the yellow ostrich feather in her bonnet waved majestically .
only the image of the man she had loved . the man she had rejected for honour 's sake one bleak october evening . and whom she had never ceased to think of since that time , she knew that [male] granger was . in all likelihood , a better and a nobler man than [female] . but the face that had been with her in the dimly lighted railway carriage .
[female] was puzzled by her strangeness , he could not understand why she did not speak to him . they drove on in silence through the dusk . so they came to the point at which the coast road turns inward towards lapton huish . a lonely spot where the cliffs break away into low hills . and the highroad runs between a ridge of shingle on one side and on the other two reedy meres .
the arrangements for [male] 's marriage occupied him for a while . he ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful . but his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be : on the contrary it evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him . it was just when the count 's affairs had become so involved that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he unexpectedly died . [male] was with the russian army in [location] when the news of his father 's death reached him .
the heads of this discussion at [female] 's had been the common theme among all classes in the town . had been carried to [female] parsonage on one side and to tipton grange on the other . had come fully to the ears of the [female] family . and had been discussed with sad reference to `` poor [female] '' by all mrs. [female] 's friends .
the idleness of those days in bed . the relaxation of body which attended them . enabled alexandra to think more calmly than she had done since emil 's death . she and [female] , she told herself . were left out of that group of friends who had been overwhelmed by disaster .
in sudden frenzy , those nearest leaped upon him , and in an instant he lay dead upon the ground . with half a dozen swords run through his body . then the men stood , in formation still , apathetically watching the events that were going on around them . meanwhile the fight on the palace steps raged more furiously than ever . the defenders were reduced now to a mere handful , a moment more .
her naïve tenderness for himself bewitched and enraptured him . who could have avoided being charmed by that pure and innocent affection , which was as freely given by the girl of eighteen as it had been by the child . and was unchanged in character by the lapse of years ? the young officer had been so much admired and caressed in calcutta , that perhaps . by reason of his successes , he had returned to england heart whole .
when he had turned many angles in this corridor . he still listened , the same silence reigned , and there was the same darkness around him . he was out of breath ; he staggered . he leaned against the wall , the stone was cold . the perspiration lay ice cold on his brow ; he straightened himself up with a shiver .
she was an interesting child ; her large , blue eyes and light hair giving promise of a comeliness which would closely approximate that of her mother . while her mential traits indicated a clear and intelligent mind , mrs. [female] had become very fond of her . [male] had unbended so gradually that his interest was not even yet clearly discernible , but he had a distinct feeling of kindliness toward her . and this readjustment of her father 's attitude had aroused in [female] an ardent desire to so conduct herself that no pain should ever come to him again . any new folly on her part would not only be base ingratitude to her father .
arrived at the house -- a well appointed cottage , with out houses larger than itself . he gave his horse to a boy to lead up and down . while he went through the gate and rang the bell in a porch covered with ivy . the old woman who opened the door said master [female] was not up yet . but she would take his message , returning presently , she asked him to walk in .
in maintaining this pious watch and ward , the good monks were particularly careful not to interrupt their hymns for an instant . lest zernebock , the ancient saxon [male] . should lay his clutches on the departed athelstane , nor were they less careful to prevent any unhallowed layman from touching the pall . which , having been that used at the funeral of saint [male] . was liable to be desecrated , if handled by the profane , if , in truth .
his passion for the emperor had cooled somewhat in [location] . but still , as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him . he often spoke about him and about his love for him . letting it be understood that he had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the emperor not everyone could understand . and with his whole soul he shared the adoration then common in [location] for the emperor .
asad from amazement had passed quickly to admiration and a sort of contrition . into which presently there crept a poisonous tinge of jealousy to see [male] prevail where he himself alone must utterly have failed . this jealousy spread all pervadingly , like an oil stain . if he had come to bear ill will to [male] before , that ill will was turned of a sudden into positive hatred for one in whom he now beheld a usurper of the power and control that should reside in the basha alone . assuredly there was no room for both of them in the bashalik of algiers .
it was nearly six o'clock , and the hour of dinner at the brewery was long passed . when mrs. [female] sat herself down by the bedside determined to reap the fruit of her victory . he had just raised himself in his bed and announced his intention of getting up . declaring , as he did so , that he would never again eat any of that accursed fish . the moment of his renovation had come upon him .
with his return she regained her content . feeling no longer the weight of winter , he spoke no more regretfully of his exclusion from the sports of the other pupils and they settled down once again into their happy routine of walks and drives . in a little while the crocuses burst into flame in the borders . and in the hedges the wild arums began to unfold , one friday afternoon in the middle of march she asked considine to let [female] drive her into dartmouth . the day was so mild that they chose the high road that skirts the edge of start bay .
but , the old abhorrence grew stronger on her as she grew weaker . and it found more sustaining food than she did in her wanderings . now , she would light upon the shameful spectacle of some desolate creature . or some wretched ragged groups of either sex , or of both sexes . with children among them , huddled together like the smaller vermin for a little warmth .
[female] , harnessed only to a straight short bar with a hook in it . leaned to her collar and dug in her hoofs at the word of command . the driver , close to her tail , held fast the slender steel chain by an ingenious hitch about the ever useful swamp hook . when [male] shouted `` whoa , '' from the top of the skidway . the driver did not trouble to stop the horse .
[male] jumped on the box , and putting his arms akimbo . told the coachman to drive to the booking office , here it is again ! again i understand it all , [female] said to herself , as soon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly . rumbled over the tiny cobbles of the paved road , and again one impression followed rapidly upon another . this was not mere supposition , she saw it distinctly in the piercing light .
it was filled with the things she had picked up quickly in her room the night of their flight from [male] 's bungalow . and as he drew them out one by one and placed them in the sun on the rock . a new and sudden rush of life swept through his veins . and he sprang to his feet and faced the river again . as if at last a hope had come to him , then he looked down again upon what she had treasured .
but had any one peeped behind the scenes it would have been discovered that during the half hour before dinner . when everyone was in their dressing rooms and the general taking his nap . a pair of ghostly [male] figures flitted about the haunted gallery . where no servant ventured without orders , the [male] fancied himself the only one who had made this discovery . for mrs. [female] affected treherne 's society in public .
a little pair of arms clutched the very young man about his leg . he gave a violent kick , scattering a number of the struggling figures and clearing a space into which he leaped . the big business man , kicking violently , and sometimes stooping down to sweep the ground with great swings of his arm . had cleared a space before them , taking loto . who looked on with frightened eyes , the three women stepped back against the side wall of the amphitheater .
[female] sat there in a panic , trying to make her mouth form words . she saw her sister 's sardonic expression and mrs. [female] 's face turning a vivid red . [male] was looking down at his watch chain , fingering it . [male] rose suddenly and awkwardly to his feet , in a second every one was standing tensely and [female] was saying something very hurriedly about having to go early . and the ahearns were listening with eager intentness , then mrs. [male] swallowed and turned with a forced smile toward [male] .
uninterrupted , therefore , except by occasional speeches from mr and mrs harrel . she spent the first part of the evening merely in surveying the company . nor was the company dilatory in returning her notice . since from the time of her entrance into the room . she had been the object of general regard .
the doorway of [female] dasso 's house stood open and the gleam of yellow light that cut into the darkness showed [female] the groom holding by the bridle a horse that seemed by its steaming hide to have been hard ridden and but newly arrived . lieutenant mozaro slackened his steps as he mounted the hill . asking himself what visitor this could be that rode in haste to dasso at so late an hour . remembering the business of his own visit he drew back into the shadow of the stable yard of a little posada that stood nearly opposite . it was striking eleven down in the town and the inn had done its business of the day .
thus hiding their warmer feelings under commonplace talk all round . [female] 's reception produced no extraordinary demonstrations . but that more was felt than was enacted appeared from the fact that her father . in taking her in doors , quite forgot the presence of [female] without . as did also [female] herself , he said nothing .
if you have his liver on your hands dont blame me . you know the doctor said any kind of a shock would set him off a mile . an now , mable , im closin for the last time , it wont be no use runin to the door when you here the postman no more cause he wont have nothin but the gas bill . from now on the only way youll here from me is in the papers perhaps when we get over there . now im going to ask you a favor , mable , for old times sake .
it is true that when she was gone , and had not opened mouth to tell what she knew . my governess was easy as to that point , and perhaps glad she was hanged . for it was in her power to have obtained a pardon at the expense of her friends . but on the other hand , the loss of her . and the sense of her kindness in not making her market of what she knew .
[female] , i said . looking past her head , `` my health is not very good , and you can bring my breakfast to me in bed after this . '' poor mr. [male] always wanted breakfast on the stroke of seven . [female] has buried husbands , also her mother is our washerwoman . and influenced by aunt adeline , [female] understands everything i say to her .
he leaned back impatiently , stifling another yawn , and trying to fix his attention on the stage . great things were going forward there , and he was not insensible to the stern beauties of the ancient drama . but the interpretation of the play seemed to him as airless and lifeless as the atmosphere of the theatre . the players were the same whom he had often applauded in those very parts . and perhaps that fact added to the impression of staleness and conventionality produced by their performance .
you are a very fine fellow , sir . [female] . i am generally admired , queen , i can quite understand it . now here is a man whose physical attributes are simply godlike , that man has a most extraordinary effect upon me . if i yielded to a natural impulse , i should fall down and worship that man . but i mortify this inclination ; i wrestle with it , and it lies beneath my feet !
the sole importance of the crossing of the berezina lies in the fact that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for cutting off the enemy 's retreat and the soundness of the only possible line of action . the one kutuzov and the general mass of the army demanded . namely , simply to follow the enemy up , the french crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal . it fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible to block its path . this was shown not so much by the arrangements it made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges .
it was the old contrast between the two ways of loving . the man 's way and the woman 's . and after a moment it seemed to [female] natural enough that susy . from the very moment of finding him again , should feel neither pity nor regret . and that strefford should already be to her as if he had never been , after all .
by his will as it at present stood he had left two thirds of his property to [male] . and one third to his daughter , with arrangements for settling her share on her children . should she be married and have children at the time of his death . this will had been made many years ago , and he had long since determined to alter it . in order that he might divide his property equally between his children .
her baby oaths were resworn , her childish wickedness depicted in colours which glowed . the biographies of the rough old country rakes who had trained her were related . in free translation , so to speak , over many a dish of chocolate and tea . and , these points dwelt on , what more dramatic than to turn upon the singular fortune of her marriage . the wealth , rank , and reputation of the man who had so worshipped her .
that mr. [male] of [male] was not such an unknown name to him as she had imagined it would be . her dinner was going off well , [male] was in good humour . and brought out his dry caustic wit admirably , mr. [male] and mr. [male] found one or two mutual subjects of interest . which they could only touch upon then , reserving them for more private after dinner talk . [female] looked beautiful in the pomegranate flowers .
after the thrifty soul had taken a few steps , instead of realizing her good fortune in being able to take any . she was bitterly disappointed to find that weeks must still pass ere she could walk by herself . she was seated on her little porch where [female] had helped her . looking out on the growing things and the blossoming spring all about . a sight to make the heart glad .
he had often come up here without stating his purpose to his mother . but this was the first time that he had been ostensibly [male] as to his purpose while really concealing it . it was a moral situation which , three months earlier . he could hardly have credited of himself , in returning to labour in this sequestered spot he had anticipated an escape from the chafing of social necessities . yet behold they were here also , more than ever he longed to be in some world where personal ambition was not the only recognized form of progress .
`` let owen have his tea first , '' her mother suggested . but the young man , declining the offer , propped his gun against the wall . and , lighting a cigarette , began to pace up and down the room in a way that reminded darrow of his own caged wanderings . [organization] pursued him with her blandishments . and for a while he poured out to her a low voiced stream of nonsense .
with but little need of the help [male] yet gave him . [male] got up , and led her to what was now a respectable little smithy . with forge and bellows and anvil and bucket . opening a door where had been none , he brought a chair . and making her sit down , began to blow the covered fire on the hearth .
mary looked at him to see if he spoke jestingly , no ! he looked savagely grave , she finished her bit of ironing . and began preparing the food she was sure her father needed . for by this time her experience in the degrees of hunger had taught her that his present irritability was increased . if not caused by want of food , he had had a sovereign given him to pay his expenses as delegate to glasgow .
the glass cutter had entered , and was feeling his way , his arms stretched out before him . at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings . there were two doors ; he bolted them both . when he drew near to the bedroom door . monte cristo expected that he was coming in , and raised one of his pistols .
the meal progressed sombrely and heavily , with much ceremony , although they were so few . was his mother practising for the future that she kept such rigid state ? he suspected as much , and that [male] was being trained to the right way of carrying herself . but that and the real sorrow of the family over their bereavement made a most oppressive atmosphere . might this be the shadow cassandra had seen lying across their future ?
hargus spoke in a low voice to [female] ; she turned and ran toward her horse . the two at the hitching rack swung into their saddles as [male] . watching [male] over his shoulder as she sped away . began to back off , his hand stealing to his gun as if moved by some slow . precise machinery which was set to time it according to the fleeing girl 's speed .
lady elmwood was sufficiently sensible of his words and their import . to make a sign as if she wished to embrace him . but finding her life leaving her fast , she reserved this last token of love for her daughter . with a struggle she lifted herself from her pillow . clung to her child -- and died in her arms .
but therein was sir [male] in great error . as in much grief and remorse he came later to see . for if instantly he had taken the queen to the king . and had dared his enemies to prove his treason and the queen 's . they would have been instantly discountenanced , and king [male] would have known and loved him as he had ever done .
if she had offered any violent opposition to mrs. [female] . mrs. [female] could have given her violence in return . but she did not , the mood of exaltation into which their love making had lifted her made her regard this woman with something nearer to pity than dislike . her attitude implied that to consider the practical aspect of the affair would be in the nature of a condescension . mrs. [female] naturally resented this , but in any case gabrielle had taken the wind out of her sails .
now [male] darbyshire was , in his listless . grumbling way , a back biting enemy of [male] . and he knew it ; but he was not to be influenced by that in a matter like this . if he had known what [male] 's home was . he would not have been so much convinced of his increasing influence over her .
however , at last i persuaded them that i had no intention of giving up the ghost that night . and then they all fell to , and thanked god with an emphasis quite unknown in church . and hereupon master stickles said , in his free and easy manner . that i was the luckiest of all mortals in having a mother . and a sister , and a sweetheart , to make much of me .
the girl was bareheaded , her face was as white as any face he had ever seen . living or dead ; her eyes were like pools that had caught the reflection of fire . he saw the sheen of her hair . the poise of her slender body . its shock , stupefaction , horror . he sensed these things even as his brain wobbled dizzily .
therefore we pursued our way , in excellent condition . having thriven upon the credit of that very popular highwayman , and being surrounded with regrets that he had left the profession . and sometimes begged to intercede that he might help the road again , for all the landlords on the road declared that now small ale was drunk . nor much of spirits called for , because the farmers need not prime to meet only common riders . neither were these worth the while to get drunk with afterwards , master stickles himself undertook .
perhaps , indeed , she had no very distinctive individuality ; perhaps at her age no woman has . but waits for it to come to her through life , through experience . she was an expression of youth . of health , of beauty , and of the moral loveliness that comes from a fortunate combination of these . but beyond this she was elusive in a way that seemed to characterise her even materially .
`` ommh , '' said mr. [male] , slowly . i do not either , only i did not understand they were engaged , it 's my business to find and distribute news . and get it fresh , `` scoop it , '' as our term is , and so , mickey , when investigations are going on . and everybody knows a denou -- a big surprise is coming .
it bears the date of july 25 , 1823 . an arrondissement of the pas [male] calais has just been the theatre of an event quite out of the ordinary course . a man , who was a stranger in the department . and who bore the name of [male] madeleine . had , thanks to the new methods , resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry .
that night was an eventful one to [female] 's brain . and one which she hardly ever forgot , she dreamt a dream . and few human beings , from nebuchadnezzar to the swaffham tinker . ever dreamt a more remarkable one , such an elaborately developed , perplexing , exciting dream was certainly never dreamed by a girl in [female] 's situation before . it had as many ramifications as the cretan labyrinth .
archer paused a moment , it was at his express wish that the announcement had been made . and yet it was not thus that he would have wished to have his happiness known . to proclaim it in the heat and noise of a crowded ball room was to rob it of the fine bloom of privacy which should belong to things nearest the heart . his joy was so deep that this blurring of the surface left its essence untouched . but he would have liked to keep the surface pure too .
blind to her , thinking only of himself , he slipped his arm softly round her waist . and drew her to him , her heart fainted . feeling herself taken , but then , his arm was so strong , she quailed under its powerful close grasp . she died a little death , and was drawn against him as they walked down the stormy darkness . he seemed to balance her perfectly in opposition to himself .
the rustic way , wide enough for a wagon , and with sloping grassy banks . and tall straggling hedges , full of dog roses and honeysuckle . led towards a river -- a fair winding stream . which was one of the glories of [location] , a little before one came to the river . the lane opened upon a green , where there was a mill , and a [male] 's cottage .
next interested in medical science , which he studied energetically , until the realities of suffering drove him from it . about this time , the same time , by the way . that ibsen 's `` the league of youth '' was being hissed down at christiana , the creative artist in strindberg began to stir . and after six months more of turmoil of soul .
after all , what was a miserable dancer on the public squares in the presence of these high born maidens ? they seemed to take no heed of her presence . and talked of her aloud , to her face , as of something unclean . abject , and yet , at the same time , passably pretty , the gypsy was not insensible to these pin pricks . from time to time a flush of shame .
a traveller who should walk and observe any of these visitants as venn observed them now could feel himself to be in direct communication with regions unknown to man . here in front of him was a wild mallard . just arrived from the home of the north wind , the creature brought within him an amplitude of northern knowledge . glacial catastrophes , snowstorm episodes . glittering auroral effects , polaris in the zenith .
she unbound the thick braid and let the silken strands of it run caressingly between her fingers . she smoothed it out , brushed it until it was more beautiful than he had ever seen it . in that glow of the sun , she held it up so that it rippled out in shimmering cascades about her . and then , suddenly , kent saw the short tress from which had been clipped the rope of hair that he had taken from [male] 's neck . and as his lips tightened , crushing fiercely the exclamation of his horror .
she knew [male] was ten but he looked no more than eight . he had the most beautiful little face she had ever seen in a child . features of exquisite delicacy and refinement . framed in a halo of chestnut curls . his mouth was delicious , being full without pouting , the crimson lips just softly touching and curving into finely finished little corners that narrowly escaped being dimpled .
d'artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions . as the breakfast at the priest 's could only be counted as half a repast . in return for the feasts which [male] . [male] , and [male] had procured him . he fancied himself a burden to the society .
there was a momentary flush on her firm square face . a momentary stillness in her restless hands . which seemed to betoken a coming outburst of anger that might throw her off her guard . but no -- she mastered the rising irritation , leaned back in her chair . crossed her arms on her broad bosom .
at these words [female] , doubting what was going on behind him . got out of the way , smiling kindly at the friend of his master . who thus found himself freed from the material obstacle which had prevented his reaching [male] . [male] made his sturdy knees crack again in rising , and crossing the room in two strides . found himself face to face with his friend .
now , for all his slenderness , his assiduous daily sword practice had given [organization] an arm of iron . also he threw his weight into the thrust . his assailant reeled backwards a few steps . and then his heel struck a baulk of timber left on the ground by some workmen that morning . and he sat down suddenly in the mud , a roar of laughter rose from all who witnessed the fine gentleman 's downfall .
it can not be helped now , of course , i knew you could not keep your temper quiet . and always told you not to go near him , how the wife answered . the course of our story at the present moment does not require me to tell . that she did answer with sufficient spirit , no one . i should say , need doubt ; and it may be surmised that things in gower street were not comfortable that evening .
they laughed with pleasure when they were in the hall . the place seemed full and busy , the porter reflected a moment . and was just going to answer , when ursula caught sight of [female] sauntering down the stairs . wearing her dark glossy coat , with grey fur , [female] looked over the rail . and immediately lost her sauntering , diffident air .
with that sir [male] threw the door open suddenly . and while the others struggled and tripped over the bench between them he had run two of them through . then in that narrow antechamber there was as fierce a fight as ever brave knight might wish to see . sir mordred from behind urged on the others with evil words , telling them to slay sir [male] . while he launched at that knight all manner of foul names .
she could not greatly influence her daughter in law against me . because , between that lady and herself there was a mutual dislike—chiefly shown by her in secret detractions and calumniations . by the other , in an excess of frigid formality in her demeanour . and no fawning flattery of the elder could thaw away the wall of ice which the younger interposed between them . but with her son , the old lady had better success .
then she crouched down gracefully on her couch , with her goat asleep at her feet . both remained motionless for several moments , considering in silence . she so much [male] , he so much ugliness . every moment she discovered some fresh deformity in quasimodo . her glance travelled from his knock knees to his humped back .
so she came soon again , and brought a horse with her that was inky [male] . when sir [male] beheld that horse . he marvelled that it was so great and so well apparelled , courageously he leaped upon him . and took no heed of himself , as soon as ever he was mounted he thrust in the spurs . and so rode away by the forest , and the moon shone clear .
eastward a belt of trees divides the dunes from a hard stony plain built upon with granite hills . westward the desert stretches for fifty eight waterless miles to mahobey and berber on the nile . a desert so flat that the merest tuft of grass knee high seems at the distance of a mile a tree promising shade for a noonday halt . and a pile of stones no bigger than one might see by the side of any roadway in repair achieves the stature of a considerable hill . in this particular may there could be no spot more desolate than the wells of obak .
that night she was safe from any encounter on her road . and she arrived at home , which she found . as she expected , empty ; for she knew it was a club night . which her father would not miss , she sat down to recover breath . and to still her heart , which panted more from nervousness than from over exertion , although she had walked so quickly .
ere long such a spring as [male] had never dreamed of swept up the mountain . with a charm so surpassing and transcending any imagined beauty that he was filled with a sort of ecstasy . he was constantly out upon the hills revelling in the lavish bounty of earth and sky . of rushing waters , and all the subtile changes in growing things . as if at last he had been clasped to the heart of nature .
`` yes , just that , '' she went on with downcast eyes , there was something prettily comical in her attitude and her tone . while i pictured to myself a poor white faced girl walking to her death with an unconscious man striding by her side , unconscious ? i do not know , first of all , i felt certain that this was no chance meeting . something had happened before , was he a man for a coup de foudre . the lightning stroke of love ? i do not think so .
he was touched by the youthful seriousness of her expression . in spite of the experiences she must have had . and of the twenty-four years to which she owned , she struck him as intrinsically young . and he wondered how so evanescent a quality could have been preserved in the desiccating [male] . as the play progressed he noticed that her immobility was traversed by swift flashes of perception .
mr. [male] looked up from his plate almost aghast . he said nothing , however , but called for the waiter . and paid for his breakfast , nevertheless , there was a considerable amount of travelling friendship engendered between the ladies and our two friends before the diligence had left the railway yard . they were two miss spaldings , going on to [female] . at which place they had an uncle .
she had utterly forgotten where and why she was going , and only by a great effort she understood the question . `` yes , '' she said , handing him her purse . and taking a little red bag in her hand , she got out of the carriage . a bell rang , some young men . ugly and impudent , and at the same time careful of the impression they were making , hurried by .
your magic and your beauty and your strength . like hills at noon or sunlight on a tree . sleeping prevail in earth and air . in the sweet gloom above the brown and white night benedictions hover . and the winds of night move gently round the room .
her name was [female] , nee kint . it ought to have been ignacia , she was a charitable woman . and did a great deal of good , there never was a [female] whose rule was milder . i was told that she never once remonstrated with the intolerable mrs. [female] . despite her tipsiness , disorder , and general neglect .
[organization] drew back and gazed at it , a weird thrill of mystery and unconscious hope beguiling for one moment her profound pang of bereavement . monteith , too , stood away a pace or two , in doubt and surprise . the deep consciousness of some strange and unearthly power overawing for a while even his vulgar and commonplace scotch bourgeois nature . gradually , as they gazed , the pale blue flame . rising higher and higher , gathered force and volume , and the perfume as of violets became distinct on the air .
by discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose , we shall clearly perceive that just as one can not imagine a blossom or seed for any single plant better suited to it than those it produces . so it is impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill . than [female] and [female] with all their antecedents . the fundamental and essential significance of the european events of the beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of the european peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west . the commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east .
i rather wished i had gone some other road . this was not the sort of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out a peaceful revolution in his mind . for it could not help bringing up the unget aroundable fact that , all gentle cant and philosophizing to the contrary notwithstanding . no people in the world ever did achieve their freedom by goody goody talk and moral suasion . it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must begin in blood .
without bothering to think to a conclusion , [male] jumped to a conclusion . he abandoned the whole democratic equality problem as a problem of silliness . what mattered was the great social productive machine , let that work perfectly , let it produce a sufficiency of everything . let every man be given a rational portion , greater or less according to his functional degree or magnitude . and then , provision made , let the devil supervene , let every man look after his own amusements and appetites .
he entered portsmouth about eight o'clock in the morning . the whole population was on foot ; drums were beating in the streets and in the port . the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea , [male] arrived at the palace of the admiralty . covered with dust , and streaming with perspiration , his countenance . usually so pale , was purple with heat and passion , the sentinel wanted to repulse him .
she surveyed herself with a glance so mingled of pity and admiration . and the truth of her words was so apparent ( only that it would have taken a week to get at the bones . before picking ) that i nearly lost good manners ; for she really seemed to suspect even me of cannibal inclinations . however , at last i made her promise to come with me on the morrow . presuming that master [female] could by any means be persuaded to keep her company in the cart .
everything happened as [female] had foreseen in that moment of prescience under the river . with her own hands she washed him clean of every mark of disaster . all night he was alone with her in the still house . his great head lying deep in the pillow , in the pocket of his coat [male] found the letter that he had written her the night before he left [location] . water soaked and illegible , but because of its length , she knew it had been meant for her .
`` oh , '' she said , clenching her fingers in an agony of poetic feeling . there were crystal tears overflowing in her eyes , the wondrous sea of feeling in her had stormed its banks . of such was the spirit of [male] , the junior senator . [male] sylvester brander . was a man of peculiar mold , in him there were joined .
a few stone steps led up to an opening . through which with stooping shoulders the man passed , here he was in a tunnel . a narrow tube , that rose gradually until the fugitive could feel the cool airs of the night upon his face . and he found himself in front of an iron gateway . he took from the pocket of his coat a key .
[male] knew that whoever was ahead of him was not far away . and he laughed and hunched his shoulders when he saw that his magnificent malemutes were making three times the speed of the huskies . it was a short chase , it led across the narrow plain and into a dense tangle of swamp . where the huskies had picked their way in aimless wandering until they came out in thick balsam and banksian pine . half a mile farther on , and the trail broke into an open which led down to the smooth surface of a lake .
nor would [male] and [male] dare to spend so much as he spent at the court . the raiment was taken from the chests and spread about freely through the halls . one could take what he would , without restraint , in the midst of the court . upon a rug , stood thirty bushels of bright sterlings . for since the time of [male] until that day sterlings had currency throughout [location] .
this catastrophe was a crisis in claude 's existence . orphaned , the eldest , head of the family at the age of nineteen . he felt himself rudely recalled from the reveries of school to the realities of this world . then , moved with pity , he was seized with passion and devotion towards that child , his brother . a sweet and strange thing was a human affection to him .
about twenty minutes later dudley pickering , smoking sentimentally in the darkness hard by the porch . received a shock , he was musing tenderly on his claire . who was assisting him in the process by singing in the drawing room . when he was aware of a figure , the sinister figure of a man who . pressed against the netting of the porch , stared into the lighted room beyond .
in a smaller chamber , facing the top of the fine stairway . the distinguished host stood ready to receive his guests , distinguished men . beautiful women , notabilities from every european country had already filed past him . had exchanged the elaborate bows and curtsies with him . which the extravagant fashion of the time demanded , and then , laughing and talking .
`` no , it 's not that , '' she said , and the door closed . perhaps , had she ever had time during the crowded months that followed . [female] would have dated certain things from that cold frosty night in december when she began to question things . for after all that was what it came to , she did not revolt , she questioned . she lay in her white bed and looked at things for the first time .
now the narrator will bid adieu to [male] . to loring , and to dunripple , the conduct of his heroine . as depicted in these pages , will , he fears , meet with the disapprobation of many close and good judges of female character . he has endeavoured to describe a young woman , prompted in all her doings by a conscience wide awake . guided by principle , willing , if need be , to sacrifice herself , struggling always to keep herself from doing wrong .
lady constantine thanked her informant , and proceeded onward , to her , as a woman . the most curious feature in the afternoon 's incident was that this lad . of striking beauty , scientific attainments , and cultivated bearing . should be linked , on the maternal side , with a local agricultural family through his father 's matrimonial eccentricity . a more attractive feature in the case was that the same youth .
going home from school in the afternoon . the brangwen girls descended the hill between the picturesque cottages of willey green till they came to the railway crossing . there they found the gate shut . because the colliery train was rumbling nearer . they could hear the small locomotive panting hoarsely as it advanced with caution between the embankments .
who but he that looketh upon the heart of man could know the battle that was fought in the soul of that giant of the hills ? he uttered no sound , he sat in his seat as if made of stone . save once , when he walked to the end of the porch to stand with clenched hands and passion shaken frame . facing the dark clump of pines on the hill . slowly the moon climbed over the ridge and lighted the scene .
jan did not know that it was this red terror that came like a nemesis of the gods to cut down the people of the great northland . until they were fewer in number than those of the sahara desert . but he learned quickly , in february , the crees along wollaston lake were practically wiped out . red flags marked the trail of the [male] . death leaped from cabin to cabin in the wilderness to the west .
she was not as handsome as [male] , he admitted . but there was something about her that moved emotions in him which slept in the other 's presence . perhaps it was the romance of their first meeting . perhaps it was the power of her dark , expressive eyes . certainly [male] had seen many prettier women in his short experience .
full of the new feeling , she bade the girl good afternoon . and went on over the stumps of hazel to where [female] and [female] were standing . they saw her approach . and [female] said , she is coming to you . it is a good omen , she dislikes me .
there was no time for flight , in the bright moonlight . they would have been easily recognized , and a wild chase would have followed , leaving the road . they forced their horses into a thick clump of bushes . where they dismounted , to hold the animals by their heads . scarcely had they gained this position when the first of the crowd reached the spot where they had been a moment before .
he saw again the handsome sullen youth in bishop towers garden , regarding him over the hedge with narrowed eyes . and his whole nature rebelled and cried out as before , `` what a waste ! '' why should he allow it to go on ? he must thrash this thing out once for all before he returned to his cabin . the right and the wrong of the case before he should see her again .
only when the day was near its end did i give up my [female] . feeling very keenly disappointed , it then struck me that the cause of the elusive creature 's behaviour was that she had been piqued at my discovery of her in one of her most secret hiding places in the heart of the wood . and that it had pleased her to pay me out in this manner . on the next day there was no change ; she was there again . evidently following me , but always invisible , and varied not from that one mocking note of yesterday .
i enjoyed going to the theater , i knew my dress was pretty . i knew that i looked nice , and that people would look at me . and that i , too , should have my share of admiration and compliments as a schöne engländerin . we were twenty minutes late -- naturally , all the people in the place stare at [male] and whisper about us . partly because we have a conspicuous place -- the proscenium loge to the right of the stage .
he knew not whether to proceed , or to quit the path and palpably shun them . to one , who seemed to put an unkind construction upon all he said and did . he knew that to do either , would be to do wrong , in spite of the propensity he felt to pass so near to [male] . could he have known what conduct would have been deemed the most respectful , whatever painful denial it had cost him . that , he would have adopted , but undetermined whether to go forward , or to cross to another path .
my father has no partner , sir , ', said i . but [male] , whose reading had lately surpassed mine . and whom nothing ever puzzled , explained that i came from the same old stock as the brothers [male] and [male] fletcher . upon which mr. [male] , who till now had somewhat overlooked me . took off his hat , and congratulated me on my illustrious descent .
it took him some time to drag a coherent story from her . [female] had told [female] in her room . and then had told [female] , she had gone to [female] at once . to see what she could do , but [female] had been in her closet . digging among her clothes , she had got out her best frock and put it on .
he followed , close up against the reeds , never trusting himself out of the shadows . after a little he heard voices , and a second canoe appeared . there was a short pause , and the two canoes continued side by side up the channel . a quarter of an hour brought both the pursuers and the pursued into the main stream . which lay in [male] gloom between forest walls that cut out all light but the shimmer of the stars .
the other way in which i managed to help the good earl brandir was of less true moment to him . but as he could not know of the first , this was the one which moved him . and it happened pretty much as follows -- though i hardly like to tell , because it advanced me to such a height as i myself was giddy at . and which all my friends resented greatly , and even now are sometimes bitter , in spite of all my humility . now this is a matter of history , because the king was concerned in it .
meantime the whole hall was in a stir ; most people rose and remained standing . for a change ; some walked about , all talked and laughed , the crimson compartment presented a peculiarly animated scene . the long cloud of gentlemen , breaking into fragments . mixed with the rainbow line of ladies ; two or three officer like men approached the king and conversed with him . the queen , leaving her chair , glided along the rank of young ladies .
it was desgas and his men . another three minutes and they would be here , another three minutes and the awful thing would have occurred . the brave eagle would have fallen in the ferret 's trap ! she would have moved now and screamed , but she dared not ; for whilst she heard the soldiers approaching . she was looking at [male] and watching his every movement .
but time went on , and he felt it a pressing duty to make the difficult disclosure . [male] , it was true , never recognized his having any affairs . and it had never even occurred to her to ask him why he happened to be at genoa . but this unconsciousness of hers would make a sudden revelation of affairs that were determining his course in life all the heavier blow to her . and if he left the revelation to be made by different persons .
voices out of the shade that cried , and long noon in the hot calm places . and children 's play by the wayside . and country eyes , and quiet faces -- all these were round my steady paces . those that i could have loved went by me ; cool gardened homes slept in the sun . i heard the whisper of water nigh me .
dear [male] , i hope you will not be angry with me for telling you . i have endeavoured to think about it as calmly as i can . and i believe that i have no alternative , the fact that your brother has quarrelled with me can not be concealed from you . and i must not leave him to tell you of the manner of it . he came to me yesterday in great anger .
but in escaping from [male] , when he feigned apoplexy , it had fallen out upon the grass . five minutes after that event , when pursuer and pursued were two or three fields ahead . the gaily dressed woman whom the yeoman had overtaken , peeped cautiously through the stile into the corner of the field which had been the scene of the scramble . and seeing the paper she climbed over , secured it . loosened the wafer without tearing the sheet , and read the memorandum within .
convulsed with amusement , yet almost paralyzed by a certain stubborn , dumb sort of embarrassment . nothing on earth could have forced [female] into making even an indefinite speech to the girl until she had made at least one perfectly definite and reasonably illuminating sort of speech to him . biting his grinning lips into as straight a line as possible , he gathered up the scattered pages of the evening paper and attacked them furiously with scowling eyes . after a really dreadful interim of silence , the mysterious little visitor rose in a gloomy . discouraged kind of way , and climbing up again on the narrow brass fender .
alexander played some hungarian music , and they all danced . seized by the spirit , [male] was marvellously exhilarated at finding himself in motion . moving towards [male] , dancing with feet that could not yet escape from the waltz and the two step . but feeling his force stir along his limbs and his body . out of captivity , he did not know yet how to dance their convulsive , rag time sort of dancing .
`` not in the least , '' he gasped , the breath knocked out of his body . just the same , he was very much alarmed , it was as dark as pitch outside and in . and he could not help wondering how near the edge of the mountain side they were running . a false move of the flying horses and they might go rolling to the bottom of the ravine . hundreds of feet below , still , he must not let her see his apprehension .
to make up for this , at home [male] had the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose . at home [female] placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband . and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied . that is , was reading or writing in his study , [male] had but to show a partiality for anything to get just what he liked done always . he had only to express a wish and [female] would jump up and run to fulfill it .
peace was made , but with her father 's coming all the world in which she had been living was transformed for [female] . she did not give up everything she had learned . but she became aware that she had deceived herself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be . her eyes were , it seemed , opened ; she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself without hypocrisy and self conceit on the pinnacle to which she had wished to mount . moreover , she became aware of all the dreariness of the world of sorrow .
sergey ivanovitch had caught nothing . but he was not bored , and seemed in the most cheerful frame of mind . levin saw that , stimulated by his conversation with the doctor , he wanted to talk . levin , on the other hand , would have liked to get home as soon as possible to give orders about getting together the mowers for next day . and to set at rest his doubts about the mowing , which greatly absorbed him .
pray write to me at once . and tell me when i shall see you , in answer to this there came a note in a very few words . she congratulated him , -- not very warmly , -- but expressed a hope that she might see him soon . but she told him not to come to brighton , the earl was better but very cross . and she would be up in town before long , towards the end of the month it became suddenly known in [location] that lord [male] had died at brighton .
she at once stretched out her little arms to be lifted , folding a shawl round her . i carried her back to the drawing room , [female] was just coming out . `` i have spoilt her , '' said he . taking her from me with good humour , and kissing her little hot face and burning lips . [male] , you care for me more than for papa , now --
there was a certain scientific practicability even in his love making , and it here came out excellently . but she sat on with suspended breath , her heart wildly beating . while he waited in open mouthed expectation , each was swayed by the emotion within them . much as the candle flame was swayed by the [female] without , it was the most critical evening of their lives . the pale rays of the little lantern fell upon her beautiful face .
it was this old woman , ornamented with the name of the principal lodger . and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress . who had let him the lodging on christmas eve . he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds . who was coming there to live with his little daughter , he had paid her six months in advance .
her ladyship assisted me to get miss [female] to her bed . his lordship the count remained in the sitting room . and having sent for my medicine chest , made a mixture for miss [female] . and a cooling lotion to be applied to her head , so as to lose no time before the doctor came . we applied the lotion , but we could not get her to take the mixture .
their chatter , their laughter , their good humoured innuendoes . above all , their flashes and flickerings of envy . revived tess 's spirits also ; and , as the evening wore on . she caught the infection of their excitement . and grew almost gay , the marble hardness left her face , she moved with something of her old bounding step .
when he put the case thus , i was glad enough to abide by his decision . and one thing was quite certain , that the doones had never before received so rude a shock . and so violent a blow to their supremacy , since first they had built up their power . and become the lords of exmoor , i knew that carver doone would gnash those mighty teeth of his . and curse the men around him , for the blunder of over confidence and carelessness .
at the sound of [male] 's approach the dismounted man leaped into his saddle . the two trespassers sat scowling inside the gate , watching him closely for the first hostile sign . [male] was trying to help the old negro to his feet . blood was streaming down his face from a cut on his forehead . he sank down again when she let go of him to welcome this unexpected help .
he received plenty of it . and seemed more pleased for his pet 's sake than for his own , ted clamoured for a lesson at once . and was soon at ease in the queer saddle . finding octoo gentle as a lamb , as he trotted away to show off at college . [male] came hastening down the hill , having seen the race from afar .
but ease of spirit comes from action only . and the world 's dignity is given to those who do the world 's work . let no man put his neck from out of the collar till in truth he can no longer draw the weight attached to it . [male] had now got rid of his collar . and he sat very wretched in his brewery counting house .
`` well , sir , '' said [male] , with a pardonable satisfaction in spinning the matter out . one was all covered with notes , and was headed padley , i read that through , sir . it had to do with the buildings and the acres . and so forth , the second paper i could make nothing out of . it was in cypher , i think , the third paper was the same .
this knight had left the field abruptly when the victory was achieved . and when he was called upon to receive the reward of his valour . he was nowhere to be found , in the meantime , while summoned by heralds and by trumpets . the knight was holding his course northward , avoiding all frequented paths . and taking the shortest road through the woodlands , he paused for the night at a small hostelry lying out of the ordinary route .
and now his life , if not more virtuous , was more crafty than it had been . he had no tutor to watch his doings and complain of them . and he had sufficient sense to keep himself from absolute pecuniary ruin . he lived , it is true , where sharpers and blacklegs had too often opportunities of plucking him . but , young as he was , he had been sufficiently long about the world to take care he was not openly robbed .
in some villages like ours an old man disguised with a long beard and gown . and a great bag , would go about at christmastide to the houses where the people had expected him . and would carry the gifts to the children , and would show others who were naughty the birch . and give them nothing , but we had no pelsnichol at our house . only sweet talk about the child [male] .
in the sky kent saw the stars clearly again . and his lungs were drinking in the cool air as in the wonderful moments before his encounter with mercer . [male] , too , was a man bred of the red blood of the north . and he knew what was in kent 's heart . for only by the breadth of a hair had kent failed in his flight .
then , threatened again with rheumatism , he strolled to the window . opened it , and leant out , there was the parapet , there the river . there to the left the beginnings of the hills , the cab driver . who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent . might be that very [male] who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago .
soon after his admission to the masonic brotherhood , [male] went to the kiev province . where he had the greatest number of [male] . taking with him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to what he should do on his estates . when he reached kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and explained to them his intentions and wishes . he told them that steps would be taken immediately to free his [male] .
where are they , then , he cried fiercely , -- the ones who are good ? among my people there are always some that are bad ; but they are in disgrace . my father punished them , the whole people punished them . if there are americans who are good , who will not cheat and kill , why do they not send after these robbers and punish them ? and how is it that they make laws which cheat ?
my nerves were already keyed to a breaking pitch . and the ghost like tread in the hall angered me—morgan , or his ally . bates , i reflected , at some new trick , i ran into my room . found a heavy walking stick and set off for bates room on the third floor . it was always easy to attribute any sort of mischief to the fellow .
buckingham bit his lips with anger . for he was truly in love with the lady [male] . and , in that case , took everything in a serious light . [male] bit his lips likewise ; but his wit always dominated over his heart . it was purely and simply to repress a malicious smile , the princess was then allowing the eyes she turned from the young nobles to wander over the green and flowery turf of the park .
suppose i see what it is ? who knows but i shall find a fortune hidden in it ? he turned back a step or two , and stooped for the little white speck . one corner of it was nestled under a stone . it was a ragged , rumpled , muddy fragment of a letter . or an essay , which rain and wind and water had done their best to annihilate .
the rector remained in town for a day or two visiting some friends . i went back to my father , to accompany him . as i had promised , on his journey from marseilles to [location] . as well as i remember , i remained a fortnight abroad , in the course of that time . i received kind letters from browndown .
`` i can see it does , '' said [male] . uncovering his mouth in a manly , quick , soldierly laugh , [male] was held unconsciously by the other man . he wanted to be near him , he wanted to be within his sphere of influence . there was something very congenial to him in birkin . but yet , beyond this , he did not take much notice , he felt that he .
to an invisible beyond which had charms for me , and was a kind of symphonic beauty in my mind . [male] lay flat upon his stomach , kicked his heels and made intricate patterns with the fir needles . while he hummed a gentle song to himself in a small . sweet voice , true as a [male] 's , but sadder . there was utter stillness and utter calm all round .
i feel quite sure that you will encounter nothing in [location] as mr. [male] 's wife to make you uncomfortable . and that he will have nothing to repent , of course englishmen generally marry englishwomen . and , perhaps , there may be some people who will think that such a prize should not be lost to their countrywomen . but that will be all , mr. [male] commands such universal respect that his wife will certainly be respected . and i do not suppose that anything will ever come in your way that can possibly make you feel that he is looked down upon .
mr [male] , all a glitter . produces his friend [male] , as dying for the honour of presentation to lady [male] . [male] presented , has the air of going to say something . has the air of going to say nothing , has an air successively of meditation . of resignation , and of desolation , backs on brewer .
it may be questioned , therefore , whether any one but mr [male] had much enjoyment of the time . mr [male] , however , thoroughly enjoyed young [male] . as a mere flask of the golden water in the tale became a full fountain when it was poured out . so mr [male] seemed to feel that this small spice of [male] imparted to his table the flavour of the whole family tree . in its presence , his [male] , fine , genuine qualities paled .
as he neared the end of the avenue . the duke was conscious of a thinning in the procession on either side of him . and anon he was aware that not one undergraduate was therein . and he knew at once -- did not need to look back to know -- why this was . she was coming , yes , she had come into the avenue .
and arm in arm the boys strolled away . leaving [female] to read music as diligently as if society had indeed no charms for her . as she bent to turn a page , the eager young man behind the piano saw the rose and was struck speechless with delight . a moment he gazed , then hastened to seize the coveted place before a new detachment of bores arrived . [male] , i can not believe it .
so now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever of denisov 's . that was why [male] had blushed and grown confused when denisov asked him whether he could stay . before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest [male] had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once . but when he saw the french and saw tikhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack that night . he decided , with the rapidity with which young people change their views .
annesley tried not to flinch under his eyes , yet -- he had put her to a severe test . last night , when he said that it would be better for her not to know his name . she had quietly agreed , but there was the widest difference between then and now . at that time they had been strangers flung together by a wave of fate which . it seemed , might tear them apart at any instant , in a few hours all was changed .
go on , said they all , we will do all that we may . then king carados and his host rode on a soft pace . till that they came as nigh king [male] as bow draught . then either battle let their horse run as fast as they might . and bleoberis , that was godson unto king [male] .
and once more he was alone in that hall with the pool of grey white marble designed by her first lover , ah ! she had been a bad lot -- had loved two men . and not himself , he must remember that when he came face to face with her once more . and suddenly he saw her in the opening chink between the long heavy purple curtains . swaying , as if in hesitation ; the old perfect poise and line .
`` follow me , then , '' said the abbe , as he re entered the subterranean passage . in which he soon disappeared , followed by dantes , after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage . which , however , did not admit of their holding themselves erect , the two friends reached the further end of the corridor . into which the abbe 's cell opened ; from that point the passage became much narrower . and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees , the floor of the abbe 's cell was paved .
he was in love , and that was all he wished for ... there , on the dressing table , lay the two studs , visible symbols of his love . dear to him , now , the colours of them ! he took them in his hand . one by one , fondling them , he wished he could wear them in the day time .
[male] , after having taken the remedy , respired freely for nearly ten minutes . he immediately gave orders that the news should be spread everywhere of a fortunate crisis . the king , on learning this , felt as if a cold sweat were passing over his brow . he had had a glimpse of the light of liberty . slavery appeared to him more dark and less acceptable than ever .
we had been having most lovely weather , and in consequence . the outdoor plants were wonderfully forward in their bloom . my father 's favorite red geraniums making a blaze of color in the front garden . the syringa shrubs filled the evening air with sweetest fragrance as we sat in the porch and walked about the garden on this last sunday of our dear father 's life . my aunt and i retired early and my dear sister sat for a long while with my father while he spoke to her most earnestly of his affairs .
loder waved his hand , whose time is his own ? ', he said . chilcote , encouraged by the remark , drew nearer to the fire . until this moment he had refrained from looking directly at his host . now , however , he raised his eyes , and , despite his preparation . he recoiled unavoidably before the extraordinary resemblance , seen here , in the casual surroundings of a badly furnished and crudely lighted room .
which i have read before , but was glad to see again , because i had forgotten that the scene is partly laid in bath . and now i can follow dear [male] and vain sir [male] . hateful [female] and scheming mrs. clay through [female] place and bath street . union street , [female] street . and the pump yard , i can even follow them to the site of the white [female] hotel .
jill turned her face to the wall beside her . a man at the next table , a corpulent . red-faced man , had begun to stare , he could have heard nothing . for wally had spoken in a low voice ; but plainly he was aware that something more interesting was happening at their table than at any of the other tables . and he was watching with a bovine inquisitiveness which affected [female] with a sense of outrage .
after some little cavil at the word `` sincere , '' and asking him if i had ever given him any answers which were not sincere . i promised him i would . why , then , his request was , he said , to let him see my purse . i immediately put my hand into my pocket , and , laughing to him . pulled it out , and there was in it three guineas and a half .
the storm broke that night , which is to say that it diminished as slowly as it had arisen . after breakfast next morning , when i had hoisted [female] body on deck ready for burial . it was still blowing heavily and a large sea was running , the deck was continually awash with the sea which came inboard over the rail and through the scuppers . the wind smote the schooner with a sudden gust . and she heeled over till her lee rail was buried , the roar in her rigging rising in pitch to a shriek .
there was a moment of death like silence , then another awful . sobbing groan , rising into a blood curdling scream . came from down the road , and , from the direction of the ruined cabin . advanced a ghostly figure , through the deep shadows and the misty light . it seemed to float toward them , moaning and sobbing as it came .
she dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg . and cry , and implore , in a passion of terror . but the master gave no attention , he snatched the child from her . and then made the men slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on the ground and hold her there and expose her body . and then he laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed .
[male] was athelena ; and since england refused him green cloth . he was having his old coats turned , in 1817 pelligrini sang . mademoiselle bigottini danced ; potier reigned ; odry did not yet exist . madame saqui had succeeded to forioso , there were still prussians in [location] . [male] delalot was a personage .
and lilian , after she had washed up the tea dishes . went upstairs and had a good cry , but the darkest hour , so the proverb goes . is just before the dawn , and after lilian had had her cry out and was sitting at her window in the dusk . watching a thin new moon shining over the trees down the street . her inspiration came to her , a minute later she whirled into the tiny sitting room where her mother was sewing .
the last two days of the voyage bartley found almost intolerable . the stop at queenstown , the tedious passage up the mersey . were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience . he had planned to stop in liverpool ; but , instead , he took the boat train for [location] . she pushed him toward the big chair by the fire .
she would have wished to pension off that [female] with half her wealth . had such pensioning been possible , but not the less did she entertain some half doubts whether it would not be well that she could abandon her own wishes . and give up her own hope of happiness , of mrs. [female] personally she had known nothing . and having expected to see a somewhat strong featured and perhaps rather vulgar woman , and to hear a voice painfully indicative of a strong mind . she was agreeably surprised to find a pretty , mild lady .
had he not vowed to keep guard over the girl ? he must do it , the trust was a sacred one . [male] found a way out of his difficulty . the post was an impersonal and incorruptible go between , so he wrote frequently , sometimes he had news to send . for , to avoid the espionage of casar , intelligence of pete came through him .
in that chamber there were no longer either judges , accusers , nor gendarmes . there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts . no one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play . the district attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting . the president that he was there to preside , the counsel for the defence that he was there to defend .
of course there was a public house in the village . and of course [male] liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there . i had received strict orders from my sister to call for him at the three jolly bargemen . that evening , on my way from school , and bring him home at my peril . to the three jolly bargemen , therefore , i directed my steps .
in vaguely silhouetted greeting for one fleet instant a little khaki arm lifted itself full length into the air . then more precipitately than any rational thing could happen , more precipitately than any rational thing could even begin to happen . could even begin to begin to happen , without shock , without noise , without pain . without terror or turmoil , or any time at all to fight or pray . a slice of living flame came scaling through the darkness .
hospital trains they could improvise out of what rolling stock remained to them . money could be borrowed , and was , but food ? clothing ? ammunition ? in his little villa on the seacoast the belgian king knew that his soldiers were hungry . and paced the floor of his tiny living room ; and over in an [male] city whose skyline was as pointed with furnace turrets as constantinople 's is with mosques . over there [female] heard that call of hunger .
the fatigue , too , of so long a journey , became soon no trifling evil . in vain were the well meant condescensions of sir [male] . and all the officious prognostications of mrs. [female] that she would be a good girl . in vain did lady bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug . and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort .
[female] strained her ears to catch the first sound of the defensive guns . she had no intention of getting up for a false alarm . for some minutes there was silence , then came a slight murmur . half sob , half sigh . as if [location] were breathing heavily in her sleep , another followed , then half a dozen in quick succession growing louder with every report .
a tranquil summer sunset shone upon him as he approached the end of his walk . and passed through the meadows by the river side . he had that sense of [male] . and of being lightened of a weight of care , which country quiet awakens in the breasts of dwellers in towns . everything within his view was lovely and placid , the rich foliage of the trees .
a mere handful of men , daring the gibes of their comrades . stopped in that first night the door stood open , with its invitation of firelight and candles . but these few went away with a strange story -- of a beautiful american , and hot soup . and even a cigarette apiece , that had been [male] 's contribution , the cigarettes . and soon the fame of the little house went up and down the trenches .
she looked up at him , wondering a little at his earnest tone . and their eyes met -- his full of tenderness , hers only shy and surprised . it was not then that the words he had to speak could be spoken . and he let the conversation drift into a general discussion of the merits of town or country life . but he was determined that the words should be spoken very soon , he went to the cottage next day .
paulucci and michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously in french , armfeldt addressed pfuel in german . toll explained to volkonski in russian , prince [male] listened and observed in silence . at the review next day the emperor asked prince [male] where he would like to serve . and prince [male] lost his standing in court circles forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign 's person . but for permission to serve in the army , before the beginning of the campaign .
after a few arguments , we agreed with [male] , as we usually ended by doing , and soothed our restlessness by visiting mr. [male] to tell him of our disappointment . if it had not been for [male] , i think the consul would have taken the point of view that he was now `` out '' of the affair . but [male] , sapphire eyed with generous zeal , is rather irresistible , fired by her enthusiasm . as he had not been by my beguiling , he volunteered to go to luxor on two or three days
iv. , 655 675 ) , poets in his own land refer to him with reverence . and foreign poets complimented him to a high degree by direct translation and by embroidering upon the themes which he had made popular . the knights made famous by chretien soon crossed the frontiers and obtained rights of citizenship in counties so diverse as [location] . [location] , [location] , [male] , [location] . and to a lesser extent in [male] and [location] .
surely she was better , of course she was better ! she had to be , she ate more , she sat up longer . she moved her feet where first they had hung helpless . she was better , much better , and for that especial reason , now was the time to watch closer than before . now he must make sure that a big strong child did not drag her from the bed .
with me , at her age , or under , neglect and disgrace were the most dreadful of punishments . but on her they made no impression , sometimes , exasperated to the utmost pitch . i would shake her violently by the shoulder , or pull her long hair . or put her in the corner ; for which she punished me with loud . shrill , piercing screams , that went through my head like a knife .
yes , to die , ... and the shame and disgrace of alexey alexandrovitch and of seryozha . and my awful shame , it will all be saved by death , to die ! and he will feel remorse ; will be sorry ; will love me . he will suffer on my account , with the trace of a smile of commiseration for herself she sat down in the armchair . taking off and putting on the rings on her left hand , vividly picturing from different sides his feelings after her death .
`` well ; you know [female] has got her money . '' [male] , as he heard this , turned away , sick at heart . the poor baby whose mother was now speaking to him had only been buried that morning . and she was already making fresh schemes for family wealth . [female] has got her money !
it was a medicinal project upon his niece 's understanding . which he must consider as at present diseased , a residence of eight or nine years in the abode of wealth and plenty had a little disordered her powers of comparing and judging . her father 's house would , in all probability . teach her the value of a good income ; and he trusted that she would be the wiser and happier woman . all her life , for the experiment he had devised .
then the squire muttered certain words below his breath . ejaculations against crosbie , which were hardly voluntary ; but even as involuntary ejaculations were very improper . mrs [female] heard them . and was not offended either by their impropriety or their warmth , `` but you can understand , '' she said , `` that she can not bring herself to go there . ''
the first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in [location] present an extraordinary movement of millions of people . men leave their customary pursuits , hasten from one side of [location] to the other . plunder and slaughter one another , triumph and are plunged in despair . and for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive movement which first increases and then slackens . what was the cause of this movement , by what laws was it governed ?
he was the predestined man , who had forced all nations to say . `` the great nation , '' he was better than that , he was the very incarnation of [location] . conquering [location] by the sword which he grasped . and the world by the light which he shed . marius saw in bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always rise upon the frontier .
she watched her stepdaughter 's face with a jealous , hungry gaze . was it beautiful ? no , the features were delicate ; the brown eyes soft and dovelike . almost lovely , now that they were irradiated by a new light , as they looked shyly up at [female] arundel . but the girl 's face was wan and colourless . it lacked the splendour of beauty .
it had not been easy to grasp , the blunt fact that she was penniless . that all this comfort which surrounded her was no longer her own , for an instant a kind of panic seized her . there was a bleakness about the situation which made one gasp . it was like icy water dashed in the face . realization had almost the physical pain of life returning to a numbed limb .
`` marry me , '' said wally , reaching across the table and putting his hand on hers . the light in his eyes lit up his homely face like a lantern . the suddenness of it startled [female] into silence . she snatched her hand away and drew back . looking at him in wonderment , she was confusedly aware of a babble of sound .
here the clock struck twelve , and both forgot themselves in watching beth . for they fancied a change passed over her wan face . the house was still as death , and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush . weary [female] slept on , and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed . an hour went by , and nothing happened except laurie 's quiet departure for the station .
these nightly drives after balls and suppers in [location] were a source of perpetual delight to marguerite . and she appreciated her husband 's eccentricity keenly . which caused him to adopt this mode of taking her home every night . to their beautiful home by the river , instead of living in a stuffy [location] house . he loved driving his spirited horses along the lonely , moonlit roads .
i had the pleasure of finding your letter here waiting my arrival . for which you have my grateful thanks , ah ! my dear freind i every day more regret the serene and tranquil pleasures of the castle we have left . in exchange for the uncertain and unequal amusements of this vaunted city . not that i will pretend to assert that these uncertain and unequal amusements are in the least degree unpleasing to me . on the contrary i enjoy them extremely and should enjoy them even more .
agatha , i am so weak , and my head so giddy . i had nothing to eat all yesterday , [male] . well , well , mr. [male] : but can you pay for it , [male] . ill , and i was not with you ? i will , now , never leave you more , look , mother , how tall and strong i am grown .
and with all this wonder of the beauty of the world still glowing in my brain hours afterward . i hear the snarling of mr. [male] above my head . and the trample and drag of feet as the men move from rope to rope and pull and haul . more weather is making , and from the way sail is being taken in it can not be far off . mr. [male] was so fooled that he actually had set the topgallant sails .
marius dwelt in solitude . owing to his taste for remaining outside of everything , and through having been too much alarmed . he had not entered decidedly into the group presided over by enjolras . they had remained good friends ; they were ready to assist each other on occasion in every possible way . but nothing more , marius had two friends .
now it chanced that sir [male] of the lake had sore offended the queen guenever . and she rebuked him harshly , called him false traitor knight . and sent him from her court , therewith he took such an hearty sorrow at her words that he went clean out of his mind . and leaped out at a bay window into a garden . and there with thorns he was all scratched up in his visage .
there is a book of revelation in every one 's life . as there is in the bible , [female] hers that bitter night . as she kept her agonized vigil through the hours of storm and darkness . she loved [male] -- had always loved him ! she knew that now , she knew that she could no more cast him out of her life without agony than she could have cut off her right hand and cast it from her .
a strange dawning was coming to him , thrilling him to his finger tips , he listened . a new sound was approaching from the hall , his door was opened . and a wheel chair was rolled in by old nepapinas , in the chair waspierre audemard . feet and hands and arms were wrapped in bandages . but his face was uncovered and wreathed in smiling happiness when he saw [male] propped up against his pillows .
a terrible inclination seized [female] to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him . but , as we have said , he was a very prudent youth . and he restrained himself , however , the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that [male] was terrified at it . and he endeavored to draw back a step or two ; but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut . the obstacle compelled him to keep his place .
in the soft clean climate of galway a man ages slowly . and this marriage renewed his youth , it made him full of new energies and enthusiasms . and revealed a boyish aspect in his character that seemed to gabrielle a little grotesque . or even frightening , he wanted to express himself boisterously , flagrantly , and the proceeding was extraordinary in the case of a man who had always been so self contained . lacking any other outlet for these ebullitions he threw himself energetically into his theological writings and worked off his surplus physical steam in the management of the roscarna estate .
until he fell asleep at last in his window seat , he listened always to these things . watched the lights ; prayed softly to himself ; clenched his nails into his hands for indignation . and looked again , on the tuesday morning came the sheriff , to dine at the castle with sir amyas . a great figure of a man , dignified and stalwart , riding in the midst of his men . after dinner came the earl of kent .
it may be as well that i should state plainly my reasons for making this offer to a gentleman with whom i am not personally acquainted . mr. [male] , on his deathbed . himself suggested it , moved thereto by what he had heard of the cruel and undeserved persecution to which you have lately been subjected . as also , -- on which point he was very urgent in what he said . by the character which you bear in the diocese for zeal and piety .
`` no , '' she said ; `` i will go with the servant . '' she went into her room to put on her hat . and when she came in again she sat once more upon the sofa beside him . he had not stirred , she put her arms about his neck . `` good by , my sweet [male] , tell me good by , '' he kissed her with a degree of passion which had not before entered into his caress .
lieutenant sutch saw more clearly into the dark places of [male] mind than [male] did himself . and because he saw so clearly , he could feel no contempt . the long years of childhood , and boyhood . and youth , lived apart in broad place in the presence of the uncomprehending father and the relentless dead men on the walls . had done the harm , there had been no one in whom the boy could confide .
bassett lounged outside the neat privet hedge which it was [male] 's custom to clip with his own bachelor hands , and waited . and as he waited he tried to imagine what was going on inside . behind the neatly curtained windows of the old brick house . he was tempted to ring the bell again , pretend to have forgotten something . and perhaps happen in on what might be drama of a rather high order ; what , supposing the man was clark after all .
and it was with this conviction that he entered on the vital period of his dual career . the imminent crisis , and his own share in it . absorbed him absolutely , in the weeks that followed his answer to fraide 's proposal he gave himself ungrudgingly to his work . he wrote , read , and planned with tireless energy . he frequently forgot to eat , and slept only through sheer exhaustion .
paulina , tell her , [female] , i will use that tongue i have . if wit flow from it as boldness from my bosom . let't not be doubted i shall do good , [female] , now be you bless would for it ! i will to the queen : please you come something nearer , keeper . madam , if't please the queen to send the babe .
this could happen only at the departure of a boat train ! but if i was not thinking about her , i was thinking about her fifteen trunks . and [female] 's sixteen and [female] 's and miss guest 's two . the maids were worse than useless , and i had no valet . i have never had a valet , i clawed .
miss [female] replied curtly , that she was tolerably happy at arden . with her `` duties , '' and that she had no desire to go roaming about the world in [female] of that contented mind which idle and frivolous persons rarely found . go where they might , she congratulated her father upon the termination of a quarrel which she had supposed too serious to be healed so easily . and trusted that he would never have occasion to regret his clemency . mr. [male] crushed the letter in his hand .
she never heard from either of her letters , but she felt better for having written them . and a day or two later she received from mrs. travers . in [location] , a small supply of the first gas masks of the war . simple and primitive they were , those first masks . useless , too , as it turned out -- a square of folded gauze .
there were no shutters to shut ; the long low window was blinking in the rays of the morning sun . the house and cow house doors were closed . and no poultry wandered about the field in search of stray grains of corn . or early worms , it was a strange and unfamiliar silence . and struck solemnly on sylvia 's mind , only a thrush in the old orchard down in the hollow .
as she held out the disengaged hand , there came the soft and gentle likeness of a smile over her face . and ester , bewildered , amazed , frightened , stood almost as transfixed as if she had been one of those who saw the angel sitting at the door of the empty tomb . stood a moment , then a sudden revulsion of feeling overcoming her . hurried forward , and dropping on her knees . bowed her head over the white hand and the half open bible .
and now about the other subject , which i own has distressed me , as you supposed it would . i mean about mrs. [female] , i find it very difficult in your letter to divide what comes from your mother and what from yourself . of course i want to make the division . as every word from you has great weight with me . at present i do not know lady [female] personally , and i can not think of her as i do of you .
all the old days seemed to come back again as we passed along the quiet roads and green lanes . just as when we were boys together , when i had none i cared for but [male] . and [male] cared only for me , the natural growth of things had made a difference in this . but our affection had changed its outward form only . not its essence , i often think that all loves and friendships need a certain three days
the next morning ere day the king ordered his best horse . and in full armour rode out alone to encounter the knight of the fountain . it was a strong battle they had . [male] 's spear was all shattered , and his horse fell to the ground . then they fought with swords with many great strokes and much blood shed on both sides .
i saw her towards the close of her honeymoon . she called on madame [female] . and sent for me into the salon , she rushed into my arms laughing . she looked very blooming and beautiful : her curls were longer , her cheeks rosier than ever . her white bonnet and her flanders veil .
she was so nice , and she told them such pretty things . [female] aram and the [male] -- how wicked [male] was to tie his poor sister up in a sack and drown her . because he did not wish her to marry the [female] ! miss sleaford had modified the romantic story in deference to the tender ages of her pupils .
he had wandered intojames 's park . and had lighted by this time half a dozen cigarettes one after another , as he sat on one of the benches . he was a handsome youth , all but six feet high . with light hair , with round blue eyes . and with all that aristocratic look , which had belonged so peculiarly to the late duke but which was less conspicuous in the present head of the family .
had he but gone with those fears of his to his brother . or had he but been able to abate them sufficiently to allow reason to prevail . he must have been brought to understand how much further they carried him than was at all justified by probability . [male] would have shown him this , would have told him that with the collapsing of the charge against himself no fresh charge could be levelled against any there . that no scrap of suspicion had ever attached to [male] .
when [female] met them in the doorway . after meeting was done , she bowed with a sweet cold [female] to the bride . who courtesied blushingly in return , with an awkward sweep of her foot in the bridal satin shoe . the bridegroom did not look at [male] at all , he held his chin well down in his stock with solemn embarrassment . and passed out stiffly , his bride on his arm .
they went out stealthily and guiltily , as if they had committed a misdemeanour . closing the door without noise , and telling the widow . who had remained in the entry , to go home and await them . that they would call in any casual passers as witnesses , if necessary . when in the street they turned into an unfrequented side alley where they walked up and down as they had done long ago in the market house at melchester .
our interesting [female] lay in the deep repose of convalescence . we placed the candles and opened the doors beforehand . i , in right of my great personal strength . took the head of the framework -- my wife and madame [female] took the foot . i bore my share of that inestimably precious burden with a manly tenderness .
a distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of him at that point now ensued . a figure apparently rose from the earth beside her . the shape beyond all doubt was troy 's . oak would not be even a possible listener , and at once turned back till a good two hundred yards were between the lovers and himself . half an hour later bathsheba entered her own house .
after a time , with returning strength , the very young man began to think more calmly . he was lost -- lost in size -- the one thing that the doctor . when they started down into the ring , had warned them against so earnestly . what a fool he had been to run , he was miles away from them now . he could not make himself large ; and were they to get smaller .
and then the tempter 's hand swept aside a dark curtain . and revealed a lovely picture of the life that might be , if [female] would only be so obliging as to sink under that tiresome low fever which had done so much mischief in the lanes about graybridge . [male] lansdell was not a hero . he was only a very imperfect , vacillating young man , with noble impulses for ever warring against the baser attributes of his mind . a spoiled child of fortune , who had almost always had his own way until just now .
why not then the same conductor for the vessel and for the girl ? the affairs of a household have their tides . their ebbs and flows , and he who knows how to steer a bark . ought to know how to guide a woman 's destiny , subject as both are to the influences of the moon and the wind . [female] being only fifteen years younger than lethierry .
he had hoped to go from the house without further converse with any of its inmates . for his mind was [male] , and he longed to be at rest . but he was not allowed to escape so easily , [male] met him at the dining room door . and accosted him with a smile , there had been time for much meditation during the last half hour . and [female] had meditated , how do you find her , [female] ? ', she asked .
she wrote that if he did not come and take matters in hand . their whole property would be sold by auction and they would all have to go begging . the count was so weak , and trusted mitenka so much , and was so good natured . that everybody took advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse . for god 's sake , i implore you .
if she had wronged him , he had wronged her yet more . for years she had listened to all the poisonous things that were said of him by his enemies . and his arrogance had made him not a few , she had disregarded all because she loved him . her relations with her brother had become strained on that account . yet now , all this returned to crush her ; repentance played its part in her cruel belief that it was by his hand [female] had fallen .
she had let go the outer world . but within herself she was unbroken and unimpaired , she only sat in her room like a moping . dishevelled hawk , motionless , mindless . her children . for whom she had been so fierce in her youth , now meant scarcely anything to her . she had lost all that , she was quite by herself .
`` of course not , of course not , '' i cried heartily . but the attention died in her eyes , she stared over my shoulder at the open door . where [female] stood , the poise of her head had lost its pride . the shadows under her eyes were [female] like the marks of blows . and all her loveliness was diverted to the expression of grief .
lifting their eyes , hilda and her companion gazed westward . and saw beyond the invisible tiber the castle [female] . that immense tomb of a pagan emperor , with the archangel at its summit . still farther off appeared a mighty pile of buildings . surmounted by the vast dome , which all of [female] have shaped and swelled outward .
it seemed to them that their sorrows . their sleepless nights , their tears , their anguish , their terrors . their despair , converted into caresses and rays of light . rendered still more charming the charming hour which was approaching ; and that their griefs were but so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy . how good it is to have suffered , their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness .
the bailiff of the courts was a sort of amphibious magistrate . a sort of bat of the judicial order . related to both the rat and the bird , the judge and the soldier . he approached his eminence , and not without a good deal of fear of the latter 's displeasure . he awkwardly explained to him the seeming disrespect of the audience .
he remembered that once , in [female] , when she was a girl . and he had gone to stay with her family in the country . she had been out when he arrived , and her mother had told him to look for her in the garden . she was not in the garden , but beyond it he had seen her approaching down a long shady path . without hastening her step she had smiled and signed to him to wait .
my appearance here , as narrator , is the necessary consequence of this arrangement . i was present during the sojourn of sir [male] in [location] . and was personally concerned in one important result of his short residence under mr. [male] 's roof . it is my duty , therefore , to add these new links to the chain of events . and to take up the chain itself at the point where .
it was not pickering 's fault that the consul was a friend of mine who kept track of my wanderings and was able to hurry the executor 's letter after me to [location] . where i had gone to meet an english financier who had , i was advised . unlimited money to spend on african railways , i am an engineer . a graduate of an [male] institution familiarly known as `` tech , '' and as my funds were running low , i naturally turned to my profession for employment .
the housekeeper told me that the architecture of `` the old wing , '' both outside and inside , was considered remarkably fine by good judges , on further investigation i discovered that good judges could only exercise their abilities on sir [female] 's piece of antiquity by previously dismissing from their minds all fear of damp . darkness , and rats , under these circumstances . i unhesitatingly acknowledged myself to be no judge at all . and suggested that we should treat `` the old wing '' precisely as we had previously treated the elizabethan bedrooms .
show you the ropes . in fact , agreed the man with her , mark [male] . he was in a rare fret and fume when he sat down to dinner alone . [male] was at [male] 's table . it was brightened by rare flowers not often seen in sterile maloja .
is it possible that filial love could hold any place in a soul so lost as his ? it is difficult to solve this enigma , [male] was ambitious . and to gain the object of his ambition he was willing to steep his soul in guilt . but he was also cautious and calculating , and he knew that to commit crime with impunity he must so shape his life as to escape suspicion . the world is easily hoodwinked ; and those who watched the life of the young surgeon were ready to declare that he was a most deserving young man .
letty had now remembered her aunt 's injunctions and threats . but , partly from a kind of paralysis caused by his coolness . partly from its being impossible to her nature to be curt with any one with whom she was not angry . partly from mere lack of presence of mind . not knowing what to do , yet feeling she ought to run to the house .
the general attention being drawn to her , including that of the dairyman 's pupil . tess flushed , and remarking evasively that it was only a fancy . resumed her breakfast , clare continued to observe her . she soon finished her eating . and having a consciousness that clare was regarding her .
and darya alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day . and drowned her grief in them for a time . half [location] and petersburg were friends and relations of stepan arkadyevitch . he was born in the midst of those who had been and are the powerful ones of this world . one third of the men in the government .
he forgot , i think , that ladies do not come out to pick roses when the ground is frozen . and that croquet is not often in progress with the hoar frost on the grass . so he walked up to the little terrace before the drawing room . and looking in saw mrs. [female] . and [female] , and [female] at their morning work .
as soon as he became the friend and secretary of canalis he did a great amount of labor for him . but by the end of eighteen months he had learned to understand the barrenness of a nature that was poetic through literary expression only . the truth of the old proverb , `` the cowl does not make the monk , '' is eminently shown in literature , it is extremely rare to find among literary men a nature and a talent that are in perfect accord . the faculties are not the man himself .
so he sat for hours in bed . like a statue , reading , his mind , hard and acute , read on rapidly . his body understood nothing , in a state of rigid unconsciousness . he read on through the night , till morning . when , weary and disgusted in spirit , disgusted most of all with himself , he slept for two hours .
[female] has invited me to spend the christmas vacation with her . she lives in worcester , [location] . was not it nice of her ? i shall love to go , i have never been in a private family in my life . except at lock willow , and the semples were grown-up and old and do not count . but the mcbrides have a houseful of children and a mother and father and grandmother .
she found him asleep upon her `` back porch , '' and placed beside him a saucer of cream . the second since his luncheon , then she watched him affectionately as he opened his eye . turned toward the saucer his noble henry the eighth head with its great furred jowls . and began the process of rising for more food , which was all that ever seemed even feebly to rouse his mind .
she wrote to her dear niece [female] , and to her dearest niece [female] . and sent little presents to her father , on one occasion she took her husband to vavasor hall . and there was a regular renewal of all the old family feelings . [male] 's husband was an old man . and was very old for his age ; but the whole thing was quite respectable .
arriving at limmeridge late on the evening of the fifteenth . miss [female] wisely resolved not to attempt the assertion of lady [female] 's identity until the next day . the first thing in the morning she went to mr. [male] 's room . and using all possible cautions and preparations beforehand , at last told him in so many words what had happened . as soon as his first astonishment and alarm had subsided , he angrily declared that miss [female] had allowed herself to be duped by [male] .
he felt momentarily as if his ear drums must burst with the incessant and tremendous concussions registered upon them . but presently this sensation passed , leaving him with that of permanent deafness . before he could recover and regain control of his startled wits the aviator had thrown down a lever . and the great fabric was in motion , it swept down the field like a frightened swan . and the wheels of its chassis , registering every infinitesimal irregularity in the surface of the ground .
it was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and the greater part of the enemy 's opened out from this battery . just facing it , on the crest of the opposite hill . the village of schon grabern could be seen . and in three places to left and right the french troops amid the smoke of their campfires . the greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill .
[male] was steering , his eyes glistening and snapping as they dwelt upon and leaped from detail to detail of the chase . now he studied the sea to windward for signs of the wind slackening or freshening . now the macedonia ; and again , his eyes roved over every sail . and he gave commands to slack a sheet here a trifle . to come in on one there a trifle , till he was drawing out of the ghost the last bit of speed she possessed .
the promise i had given did not expose me to the annoyance of being kept long on the watch against accidents . if we could pass safely over the next five days , we might feel pretty sure of the future . on the last day of the old year , lucilla was bound by the terms of the will to go to [location] . and live her allotted three months under the roof of her aunt . in the brief interval that elapsed before her departure , she twice approached the dangerous subject .
marguerite 's aching heart stood still , she felt . more than she heard , the men on the watch preparing for the fight . her senses told her that each , with sword in hand . was crouching , ready for the spring , the voice came nearer and nearer ; in the vast immensity of these lonely cliffs . with the loud murmur of the sea below , it was impossible to say how near .
oh , it might interest you . there are pigs teeth stuck into the trunk , about four feet from the ground . the country people put them in long ago . and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark . it will cure the toothache , the teeth are almost grown over now .
there was something most passionate in [female] 's reading aloud . they seemed nearer , not only mentally , but physically , when they read . than when she was in his arms , and this was often , for they fell half into love almost from the first . yet was amory capable of love now ? he could , as always , run through the emotions in a half hour . but even while they revelled in their imaginations , he knew that neither of them could care as he had cared once before .
but while the sound of our cheer rang back among the crags above us . a shrill clear whistle cleft the air for a single moment . and then a dozen carbines bellowed , and all among [female] flew murderous lead . several of our men rolled over , but the rest rushed on like britons . jeremy and myself in front .
it was stark who yelled in blind atavistic fear . and the echo of his own cry brought him up standing . shaking in every limb , he had dropped the talisman . it lay gleaming in the snow at his feet . and the alien memories were gone -- and camar was dead .
besides him , she had not a single male relative in this world . neither had she mother or sister on whom to let out her heart . while of mrs. wardour , who was more severe on her than on any one else . she was not a little afraid : from these causes it came that [male] grew and grew in [male] 's imagination . until he was to her everything great and good -- her idea of him naturally growing as she grew herself under his influences .
most of my readers are aware that the second act of [female] opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which [female] , while sleeping , betrays to azzo the secret of her love for [female] . the injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy . until conviction seizes on his mind . and then , in a frenzy of rage and indignation .
`` we are very much obliged , '' said mrs. [female] . who had not understood the point of [female] 's speech . `` my sister is , i am sure , '' said priscilla , who had understood it . there was once a family of three ancient maiden ladies , much respected and loved in the town in which they lived . their manners of life were well known among their friends .
the kiss filled him with a strange comfort . he led her back to where she had been so upset . and the dog balthasar , following , laid the bone of one of the cutlets they had eaten at their feet . anxious to obliterate the memory of that emotion , he could think of nothing better than [location] . and moving with her slowly from cabinet to cabinet , he kept taking up bits of dresden and lowestoft and chelsea .
and so finishing his speech , sir [male] retired within , and recruited himself in the usual manner . mr moffat was a young man . and there was no knowing to what proficiency in the parliamentary gift of public talking he might yet attain . but hitherto his proficiency was not great , he had , however , endeavoured to make up by study for any want of readiness of speech . and had come to barchester daily , for the last four days , fortified with a very pretty harangue .
`` how , not rec ... '' kutuzov began , but checked himself immediately and sent for a senior officer . getting out of his caleche , he waited with drooping head and breathing heavily . pacing silently up and down , when eykhen , the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned . appeared , kutuzov went purple in the face , not because that officer was to blame for the mistake . but because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on .
breakfast had not been long over , when they were joined by captain and mrs harville and captain [female] . with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about lyme . they ought to be setting off for uppercross by one , and in the mean while were to be all together . and out of doors as long as they could , [female] found captain [female] getting near her . as soon as they were all fairly in the street , their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again .
before taking a single step in the preparations , [female] , with no great hopes . went across that evening to the timber merchant 's to ascertain if [female] and her parents would honor him with their presence . having first to set his nightly gins in the garden , to catch the rabbits that ate his winter greens . his call was delayed till just after the rising of the moon . whose rays reached the hintock houses but fitfully as yet .
he found the great house at loughlinter nearly empty , mr. [male] 's mother was there . and lord brentford was there , and lord brentford 's private secretary . and mr. [female] 's private secretary , at present that was the entire party . lady baldock was expected there , with her daughter and violet effingham . but , as well as [female] could learn , they would not be at loughlinter until after he had left it .
there were no great proofs of sorcery in that , after all , but there was still enough smoke to warrant a surmise of fire . and the archdeacon bore a tolerably formidable reputation , we ought to mention however . that the sciences of [location] , that necromancy and magic . even the whitest , even the most innocent , had no more envenomed enemy , no more pitiless denunciator before the gentlemen of the officialty of notre dame . whether this was sincere horror , or the game played by the thief who shouts .
dearest : today i came upon a strange spectacle . poor old nan nan weeping for wounded pride in me . i found her stitching at raiment of needlework that is to be mine ( piles of it have been through her fingers since the word first went out . for her love asserts that i am to go all home-made from my old home to my new one . wherever that may be , ) , and she was weeping because , as i slowly got to understand .
after the last trouble , bad rufe tolliver had gone west and old judd had moved his family as far away as possible . [male] looked around him : this , then , was the home of devil judd tolliver . the little creature inside was his daughter and her name was june . all around the cabin the wooded mountains towered except where , straight before his eyes . lonesome creek slipped through them to the river .
but to see nothing except the desirable cause , and close upon it the desirable effect . rids [female] of doubt and makes our minds strongly intuitive . that was the process going on in poor [female] , while she arranged all objects around her with the same nicety as ever . only with more slowness -- or sat down to the piano , meaning to play . and then desisting , yet lingering on the music stool with her white fingers suspended on the wooden front .
he told stories to the men . implored them to bear up for the helpless women 's sake . and promised rewards if they would pull while they had strength to regain the lost route . as nearly as he could make it out , and increase their chance of rescue . he rigged an awning of sailcloth over the suffering man and tended him like a son .
as he sat forming plans how to retrieve the opinion . ill as it was , which [organization] formerly entertained of him . he received a letter from lord elmwood . kindly enquiring after his health , and saying that he should be down early in the following week . never were the friendly expressions of his uncle half so welcome to him .
with the children 's things to pack , luncheon to be got ready , and the fontainebleau pension to be telephoned to . there was little time to waste on moral casuistry ; and susy asked herself with a certain irony if the chronic lack of time to deal with money difficulties had not been the chief cause of her previous lapses . there was no time to deal with this question either ; no time . in short , to do anything but rush forward on a great gale of plans and preparations . in the course of which she whirled [female] forth to buy some charcuterie for luncheon .
he walked through the wood to the lonely building by the river . the march winds were blowing among the leafless trees . ruffling the [male] pools of water that the rain had left in every hollow . the smoke from the chimney of [male] 's painting room struggled hopelessly against the wind . and was beaten back upon the roof from which it tried to rise , everything succumbed before that pitiless north easter .
nutty shut his eyes again , he would count sixty this time . a cold fear had laid its clammy fingers on his heart . this was what that doctor -- not such a chump after all -- must have meant ! nutty began to count , there seemed to be a heavy lump inside him , and his mouth was dry . but otherwise he felt all right , that was the gruesome part of it .
having spoken to this effect , he appealed to lucilla 's own good sense to recognize the necessity of taking time to consider her decision . and to consult on it with relatives and friends . in plain words , for at least three months the family arrangements must be so shaped . as to enable the surgeon in attendance on her to hold the absolute power of regulating her life . and of deciding on any changes introduced into it , when she and the members of her family circle were sure of being able to comply with these conditions .
there will be found in part vii. , some curious recipes . many of them appear to be as primitive as the book itself . but in later works of the same nature these recipes and prescriptions appear to have increased . both as regards quality and quantity . in the anunga runga or `` the stage of love , ''
presently they came close down upon the beach , the air smelt salt . the noise of the surf increased ; and here , in a large walled garden . there stood a small house of two storeys , with stables and other offices . the foremost torch bearer unlocked a door in the wall . and after the whole party had passed into the garden , again closed and locked it on the other side .
he then gave her some general cautions to be upon her guard against their artifices . and changing the subject , talked , for the rest of his visit . upon matters of general entertainment , at this time . preparations were making in the family for removing to violet bank to spend the easter holidays . but [male] , who was too much grieved at such perpetual encrease of unnecessary expences to have any enjoyment in new prospects of entertainment .
a long and [male] afternoon i passed in those green bowers . all silent , tranquil , and alone with birds . and bees , and flowers , yet , when my master 's voice i heard call . from the window , [male] ! i entered , joyful , at the word , the busy house again .
george 's library was no very brilliant collection of literature . there was an old greek testament and the eton [location] . a french pamphlet on the cavalry sword exercise . an odd volume of [male] with one half of its stiff leather cover hanging to it by a thread . [male] 's [male] , printed in a murderous type .
jeremiah , whose eyes glistened as if they saw money . darted a sudden look at the son , which seemed to say , i owe you no thanks for this . you have done nothing towards it ! and then told the mother that he thanked her . and that [female] thanked her , and that he would never desert her .
they noted neither rain nor wind . neither the hideousness of the fields nor the muddy ways . they seated themselves on the low wall of a park . a section of which had recently fallen in , under [female] 's umbrella . which scarcely protected her head and shoulders , [female] , her legs hanging down and her hands wet .
whether or not this were greek to the man behind the wicket , it was accepted with complete indifference . or , rather , with an interest that apparently evaporated on receipt of the fees . lanyard could not see that the clerk favoured him with as much as a curious glance before he turned away to lose himself . to bury his identity finally and forever under the incognito of the lone wolf . he could not have rested without taking that one step to compass the arrest of the [male] assassin .
but a more serious fault with which he reproached justin was his constantly listening to conversation . on sunday , for example , one could not get him out of the drawing room . whither madame [male] had called him to [male] the children . who were falling asleep in the arm chairs , and dragging down with their backs calico chair covers that were too large . not many people came to these soirees at the chemist 's .
but the elder man was of the younger 's opinion . he had made a fool of himself . and was ashamed that he had attached importance to an unsigned communication . all he desired was to let the unpleasant business drop . this being settled , knight , in whose hand was the typewritten letter .
[female] 's face flagged , there was to be a party at the yeobrights ' . she , naturally , had nothing to do with it . she was a stranger to all such local gatherings . and had always held them as scarcely appertaining to her sphere , but had she been going . what an opportunity would have been afforded her of seeing the man whose influence was penetrating her like summer sun !
the large horny hand clasped round the small delicate one . the servant man turned , and with a stiff , respectful bow to me . led [male] from the room , the door closed after him . he was gone , the light of two lonely lives was put out . was our [male] right or wrong in that persistent auf wiedersehen of his ?
let it be enough to say that the time when she first surprised my secret was . i firmly believe , the time when she first surprised her own . and the time , also , when she changed towards me in the interval of one night . her nature , too truthful to deceive others , was too noble to deceive itself . when the doubt that i had hushed asleep first laid its weary weight on her heart .
`` we can easily send domenico , '' said rose ; and at her gentle voice he turned his head . why , there was his friend , the sweet named lady -- but how had she not in this short interval changed ! was it the failing light making her so colourless , so vague featured , so dim . so much like a ghost ? a nice good ghost , of course . and still with a pretty name , but only a ghost .
the cry had a note of despair in it . again the wind intercepted their words , they said no more . at length they drew up beneath a lamp post , simultaneously . between twelve and one that sunday night katharine lay in bed . not asleep , but in that twilight region where a detached and humorous view of our own lot is possible .
there had come to be very high words indeed between mr. [male] and mr. [male] . and some went so far as to declare that they had heard the builder threaten to punch the minister 's head . this mr. [male] denied stoutly , as the methodist party were making much of it in consequence of mr. [male] 's cloth and advanced years . `` there 's no lies is too hot for them , '' said mr. [male] . in his energy , and `` no lawlessness too heavy , '' then he absolutely refused to put his hand to a spade or a trowel .
i entered , and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth . rocking herself in a little chair that had been her mother 's when a child . her hat was hung against the wall , and she seemed perfectly at home . laughing and chattering , in the best spirits imaginable , to hareton -- now a great . strong lad of eighteen -- who stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment .
she was thinking of this when a bell [female] and shrill in her ear . and looking round suddenly , she saw a man in livery . a man who looked like a groom -- standing outside the garden gate . she was so near the gate that it would have been a mere affectation to keep the man waiting there while mrs. [female] made her way from the remote premises at the back of the house . the doctor 's wife turned the key in the lock and opened the gate .
ramona felt every note of it penetrating her consciousness with a subtle thrill almost like pain . when the hymn ended , she listened eagerly , hoping father salvierderra would strike up a second hymn . as he often did ; but he did not this morning . there was too much to be done ; everybody was in a hurry to be at work . windows shut , doors opened ; the sounds of voices from all directions .
in effect , the swain was standing up in his gondola . card case in hand , affecting to put the question to a servant . this conjunction of circumstances led to his immediately afterwards presenting himself before the young ladies in a posture . which in ancient times would not have been considered one of favourable augury for his suit . since the gondoliers of the young ladies , having been put to some inconvenience by the chase .
he emptied a half of the contents of the rubber sack out on the sand and made a selection for dinner . and he chuckled in his big happiness as he saw how attenuated his list of supplies was becoming . there was still a quarter of a pound of tea . no sugar , no coffee , half a dozen pounds of flour . twenty seven prunes jealously guarded in a piece of narwhal skin .
but all the same i firmly made up my mind that when `` my father '' billali began to fire i would without fail lie down or take refuge behind a tree . the regiment of guards did not come further than the entrance to the cave . where they formed up to let [male] pass through , on entering the place itself we were . however , met by a man robed in white , who bowed humbly , but said nothing .
this stiffness of manner in [male] had been of great service to him . it is so true that fortune , when she has a caprice . resembles those women of antiquity . who , when they had a fancy , were disgusted by no physical or moral defects in either men or things . [male] , placed with michel letellier .
`` and what shall we do about [female] ? '' said [female] . who was sitting with the list before her , [female] , who was leaning over her sister . puckered up her mouth and said nothing , she had watched from the house door on that saturday evening . and had been perfectly aware that [female] had taken [female] off towards the stile under the trees . she could not bring herself to say anything against [female] .
it was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed . but in place of the russian order of life that had been destroyed . [male] unconsciously felt that a quite different , firm , french order had been established over this ruined nest . he felt this in the looks of the soldiers who . marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily , were escorting him and the other criminals .
what took place between these two beings ? nothing . they adored each other . at night , when they were there , that garden seemed a living and a sacred spot . all flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense . and they opened their souls and scattered them over the flowers . the wanton and vigorous vegetation quivered , full of strength and intoxication .
for amusement he may pick coal lump by lump out of the scuttle with the tongs and pile it in a little heap in the fender . keeping count of the lumps , which must all be put back again , one by one and very carefully . he may set himself sums if he cares to work them out . he may talk to himself or to the cat if she chooses to visit him . and if his trade has been that of an artist , he may sketch in the air with his forefinger .
he was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool shops . instinctively , unconsciously , with every book , with every conversation , with every man he met . he was on the lookout for light on these questions and their solution . what puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the majority of men of his age and circle had . like him , exchanged their old beliefs for the same new convictions .
if the other persons should at last be taken , and brattle should not then be forthcoming . justice would suffer , said sir [male] , county magistrates . as a rule , are more conspicuous for common sense and good instincts than for sound law . and mr. [male] may , perhaps , have been right in his view of the case . nevertheless bail was demanded , and was not forthcoming without considerable trouble , mr. [male] .
i stayed here about five weeks , and indeed had much ado to get away then . nay , he would have come over the bay with me . but i would by no means allow him to it . however , he would send me over in a sloop of his own . which was built like a yacht , and served him as well for pleasure as business .
for some minutes i lay faintly turning these terrors over in my mind . while my physical strength came back to me , which it quickly did in that buoyant atmosphere . then i bethought me of the others , and staggered to my feet . to see if i could arouse them , but first i took up ayesha 's kirtle and the [location] scarf with which she had been wont to hide her dazzling loveliness from the eyes of men . and , averting my head so that i might not look upon it .
the talk about [female] and [female] had been slow in reaching the house on the hill . when it came , via a little group on the terrace after the luncheon . mrs. [male] was upset and angry and inclined to blame wallie , everything that he wanted had come to him . all his life , and he did not know how to go after things . he had sat by , and let this shabby genteel doctor , years older than the girl .
and he leaned back against his dunnage sack , staring again at the witching slimness of the lovely [female] boulain as she calmly resumed her paddling in the bow of the canoe . in the few minutes following the efficient and unexpected warning of bateese an entirely new element of interest entered into the situation for [male] carrigan . he had more than once assured himself that he had made a success of his profession of man hunting not because he was brighter than the other fellow . but largely because he possessed a sense of humor and no vanities to prick . he was in the game because he loved the adventure of it .
for the most part , the remaining four hunters leaned on the table or lay in their bunks and left the discussion to the two antagonists . but they were supremely interested , for every little while they ardently took sides . and sometimes all were talking at once , till their voices surged back and forth in waves of sound like mimic thunder rolls in the confined space . childish and immaterial as the topic was , the quality of their reasoning was still more childish and immaterial . in truth , there was very little reasoning or none at all .
the suggested loneliness affected him , the tall trees . still bereft of leaves , and the colossal gateway incomprehensively stirred the sense of mental panic that sometimes seized him in face of vastness of space or of architecture . in one moment , lillian , the appointment he had just made . the manner of its making -- all left him . the world was filled with his own personality , his own immediate inclinations .
dantes remained in his cell all day . not daring to return to his friend , thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced . once for all , that the abbe was mad -- such a conviction would be so terrible ! but , towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by . faria , not seeing the young man appear , tried to move and get over the distance which separated them .
no one belonging to them need want for aught . when once the good opinion of miss stanbury had been earned , when once she believed in her servant there was nobody like that servant . there was not a man in exeter could clean a boot except [female] hickbody . and if not in exeter , then where else ? and her own maid [female] . who had lived with her now for twenty years , and who had come with her to the brick house when she first inhabited it .
lord [male] , who was also on the bench . took his account of the trial home to his wife and sister in portman square . at this time miss [female] was staying with them . and the three ladies were together when the account was brought to them . in that house it was taken as doctrine that [female] finn was innocent .
the prisoner in the potato cellar received our due attention . and my grandfather 's joy in the fact that an agent of the british government was held captive in glenarm house was cheering to see . but the man 's detention was a grave matter . as we all realized , and made imperative the immediate consideration of [male] 's future . my grandfather spoke of my remaining with a warmth that was grateful to my heart .
thus it came about that he saw katharine hilbery coming towards him . and looked straight at her , as if she were only an illustration of the argument that was going forward in his mind . in this spirit he noticed the rather set expression in her eyes . and the slight , half conscious movement of her lips , which , together with her height and the distinction of her dress . made her look as if the scurrying crowd impeded her .
this was by coming down from the outskirts of the camp in the evening . and seating himself near the brink of the mill pond as soon as it was quite dark . where he watched the lights in the different windows till one appeared in [female] 's bedroom . and she herself came forward to shut the casement . with the candle in her hand , the light shone out upon the broad and deep mill head .
the position was one of misery for all three ; and not one of them would have been equal to enduring this position for a single day . if it had not been for the expectation that it would change . that it was merely a temporary painful ordeal which would pass over . [male] hoped that this passion would pass , as everything does pass . that everyone would forget about it , and his name would remain unsullied .
being so deadly white he looked like a horrible dirty invalid in a ragged dressing gown . the coat flapped open in front and the rest of his apparel consisted of one brace which crossed his naked . bony chest , and a pair of trousers . he blinked rapidly as if dazed by the faint light . while his patron , the old bandit , glowered at young [male] from under his beetling brow .
certainly , said he , i am [male] if [male] is not laying a snare for this amorous boy . [male] , this evening , gave an address . and made an appointment as complacently as [male] daangeau himself could have done . i heard him , and i know the meaning of his words . `` tomorrow morning , '' said he .
they were some time silent , the duke knocked at the door . and enquired of the man who opened it concerning the lady and cavalier then in his cottage . he was assured there were no other persons in the cottage than those he then saw . the duke persisted in affirming that the persons he enquired for were there concealed . which the man being as resolute in denying .
he glanced at the sky , expecting to find there the cloud shell he had been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of that night . there was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell . there , in the remote heights above , a mysterious change had been accomplished , there was no trace of shell . and there was stretched over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets . the sky had grown blue and bright ; and with the same softness , but with the same remoteness .
my brother in law left [female] yesterday . and has put [male] all into a twitter , he said . just as he was going away , that he did not believe that lord trowbridge had any right to give away the ground . because it had not been in his possession or his family 's for a great many years . or something of that sort , we do not clearly understand all about it .
ex conductor brophy was at that time sheriff . the officers noting our arrival at such time . at once ordered [male] out of the city , as they suspected we knew something about the outbreak . we protested our innocence of any knowledge of the trouble . but appearances were against us , so we had to leave .
he looked round with shiny gladness . and when all were seated on the hearth the scene was worth peeping in upon . on one side baby under her scarlet quilt in the corner being rocked by the young mother . and [female] rebekah seated on the grandmother 's knee . on the other , [male] between his father 's legs .
but when , out of sight of the blower , the girl momentarily tried it on . in a corner by the organ , it seemed to her that the ornament was possibly lady constantine 's . now that the pink beads shone before her eyes on her own arm she remembered having seen a bracelet with just such an effect gracing the wrist of lady constantine upon one occasion . a temporary self surrender to the sophism that if mr. [male] chose to give away anything belonging to his sister . she , tabitha , had a right to take it without question .
as very present seemed the day on which he made resolutions of trying to be like them . it was in the spring , and some one had brought in cowslips . and the scent of those flowers was in his nostrils now . as he lay a dying -- his life ended . his battles fought , his time for `` being good '' over and gone -- the opportunity .
but both client and lawyer were almost too careful for him . and he had learned positively nothing when the latter rose to depart . he instantly left the room , with the door a trifle ajar . and listening intently , heard his master say that mr. [male] must come again the next morning . that he felt better , and would think over the suggestions he had made .
she looked at him and tried to make her expression contemptuous . but he only laughed , acknowledging her defeat but disclaiming all future interest in the punch . she left the room , at seven thirty , her cheeks glowing and her high piled hair gleaming with a suspicion of brilliantine . evylyn descended the stairs , mrs. [female] . a little woman concealing a slight nervousness under red hair and an extreme empire gown .
the housemaids burst into loud laughter , and then a sullen look of dogged obstinacy passed over and settled on esther 's face . even to the point of visibly darkening the white and rose complexion , a sloping roof formed one end of the room . and through a broad , single pane the early sunlight fell across a wall papered with blue and white flowers . print dresses hung over the door . on the wall were two pictures -- a girl with a basket of flowers .
sometimes , when the weather was very hot , and he had exhausted himself with the exertion of smoking his german pipe . and reading french novels , he would stroll into [location] . and lying in some shady spot , pale and cool . with his shirt collar turned down and a blue silk handkerchief tied loosely about his neck . would tell grave benchers that he had knocked himself up with over work .
philip received the reprimand with good [female] . and bowed , first smiling at his brother , and then at his mother , but [male] saw from the corner of his eye that a group was about to be formed in the corner of the room . and that the duc d'anjou , with the comte [male] . and the chevalier [male] lorraine , prevented from talking aloud , might say , in a whisper . what it was not convenient should be said , he was beginning , then , to dart at them glances full of mistrust and uneasiness .
he it was who had given a shrill shout . and as i ran across a piece of waste ground to see what was the matter . i saw him crouching on the ground , while over him stood a big bully . whom i had before seen at the door of a low grog shop . making a vicious cut at the `` nigger '' with a heavy stock whip .
i would have liked to ask her for instance . `` do you know what you have done with yourself ? '' a question like that , anyhow it was time for one of [male] to say something . a question it must be , and the question i asked was . `` so he 's going to show you the ship ? ''
the poverty stricken [female] family had been all this time trying once more to raise the ransom money . and at last a sum of three hundred ducats was got together and entrusted to the redemptorist father [male] . who was about to sail for algiers , the dey , however , demanded more than double the sum offered . and as his term of office had expired and he was about to sail for constantinople . taking all his slaves with him , the case of [male] was critical .
notwithstanding that its walls were blotched , as if missionary maps were bursting out of them to impart geographical knowledge . notwithstanding that its weird furniture was forlornly faded and musty , and that the prevailing venetian odour of bilge water and an ebb tide on a weedy shore was very strong . the place was better within , than it promised , the door was opened by a smiling man like a reformed assassin . a temporary servant -- who ushered them into the room where mrs [female] sat . with the announcement that two beautiful english ladies were come to see the [female] .
now a [location] policeman in a political row is . i believe , the most forbearing of men , so long as he meets with no special political opposition . ordinary ill usage does not even put him out of temper . he is paid for rough work among roughs . and takes his rubs gallantly , but he feels himself to be an instrument for the moment of despotic power as opposed to civil rights .
meanwhile , after several moments of triumph , quasimodo had plunged abruptly into the church with his burden . the populace , fond of all prowess . sought him with their eyes , beneath the gloomy nave . regretting that he had so speedily disappeared from their acclamations , all at once , he was seen to re-appear at one of the extremities of the gallery of the kings of [location] . he traversed it , running like a madman .
their truth , mun suit different for different minds . and be a bit tender in th way of giving it too , or th poor sick fools may spit it out i ', their faces . now hamper first gi'es me a box on my ear .
she had a kind heart . and it distressed her to give pain . it also got on her nerves to be dogged by stricken males who tried to catch her eye in order that she might observe their broken condition . she recalled one house party in wales where it rained all the time and she had been cooped up with a victim who kept popping out from obscure corners and beginning all his pleas with the words i say . you know ... , she trusted that otis [male] was not proposing to conduct a wooing on those lines .
at this moment he was lying ill of fever in the clay lands near curitiba in [location] . having been drenched with thunder storms and persecuted by other hardships , in common with all the english farmers and farm labourers who . just at this time , were deluded into going thither by the promises of the brazilian government . and by the baseless assumption that those frames which . ploughing and sowing on english uplands , had resisted all the weathers to whose moods they had been born .
before i go any further i will confess that the matter is one . i was going to say almost of life and death to me . circumstances , not of my own seeking , have for some years past thrown me so closely into intercourse with your family that now to be cast off . and to be put on one side as a disgraced person , -- and that so quickly after the death of her who loved me so dearly and who was so dear to me . is such an affront as i can not bear and hold up my head afterwards .
of six children , my sister [male] and myself were the only two that survived the perils of infancy and early childhood . i , being the younger by five or six years . was always regarded as the child , and the pet of the family . father , mother , and sister . all combined to spoil me—not by foolish indulgence , to render me fractious and ungovernable .
before she went to find beenie , who was still at testbridge . in a cottage of her own , she felt she must think over these things . and come , if possible , to some conclusion about them , she left the town . therefore , and walked homeward , what did it all mean ? she knew very well they must look down on her ten times more than ever .
then the session was at an end , and they who had been staunch to the last got out of town as quick as the trains could carry them . the duchess of omnium was not the most discreet woman in the world . that was admitted by her best friends , and was the great sin alleged against her by her worst enemies . in her desire to say sharp things , she would say the sharp thing in the wrong place . and in her wish to be good natured she was apt to run into offences , just as she was about to leave town .
he angrily stiffened himself up into coldness of demeanour . almost to his surprise , [male] 's greeting to the new comer was as cold as his own . she stood rather behind him ; so perhaps she did not see the hand which kinraid stretched out towards her . for she did not place her own little palm in it . as she had done to [female] an hour ago .
the glow of the signal fire lighted up the sky above him . and he climbed up , higher and higher , scrambling swiftly from rock to rock . until he saw the tips of the flames licking up into the sky . he had come up the steepest and shortest side of the ridge . and when he reached the top he lay upon his face for a moment .
would it seem dreadful to him to buy a jewel which he might guess . from its low cost , had to be got rid of at almost any price ? [female] was forced to admit , much as she loved knight . that his daring , original nature might enter into strange adventures and intrigues for sheer joy in taking risks . she imagined that some wild escapade regretted too late might have led him into association with the watchers .
chauvelin smiled benignly , and rubbing his long , thin hands together , he looked round the deserted supper room . whence even the last flunkey had retired in order to join his friends in the hall below . all was silence in the dimly lighted room , whilst the sound of the gavotte . the hum of distant talk and laughter . and the rumble of an occasional coach outside , only seemed to reach this palace of the sleeping beauty as the murmur of some flitting spooks far away .
i am doomed to death myself . must i desecrate my country with my impious touch ? the way to put the money back is closed to me . i have not the strength to return to the room . take again that key , open once more that safe -- i should swoon on the threshold of my husband 's door . the only road left now is the road in front .
the heart of a girl in spring is the home of dreams . and [female] 's heart overflowed with them . until her pulse thrilled and sang in quickening cadences , the wistfulness of april . the dream of unfathomable things , shone in her brown eyes . and a girl with dreams in her eyes is the divinest work of the gods .
sitting in his chamber that saturday afternoon , a rap at his door aroused him . he had been speculating upon the futility of his political energy in the light of the impermanence of life and fame . he arose , and opening wide his door , perceived [female] . she had come , as she had suggested to her mother . at this time , instead of on monday , in order to give a more favorable impression of promptness .
in the meantime , mr. [male] and trevelyan were visiting the child . it was evident that the father , let him be ever so mad . had discerned the expediency of allowing some one to see that his son was alive and in health . mr. [male] did not know much of children , and could only say afterwards that the boy was silent and very melancholy . but clean , and apparently well , it appeared that he was taken out daily by his father in the cool hours of the morning .
the child hung her head , and would not look at colville . she was still shy with him ; his absence must have seemed longer to a child , of course . at lunch they talked of the carnival sights that had begun to appear . he told of his call upon mr . waters , and of the old minister 's purpose to see all he could of the carnival in order to judge intelligently of [location] 's opposition to it .
the winter had broken early and the scotch river was running ice free and full from bank to bank . there was still snow in the woods , and with good sleighing and open rivers every day was golden to the lumbermen who had stuff to get down to the big water . a day gained now might save weeks at a chute farther down . where the rafts would crowd one another and strive for right of way . [male] was mightily pleased with himself and with the bit of the world about him .
wit , very pretty , why , you make no more of making of lovers . madam , than of making so many card matches , milla . one no more owes one 's beauty to a lover than one 's wit to an echo . they can but reflect what we look and say : vain empty things if we are silent or unseen . and want a being , mira , yet , to those two vain empty things . you owe two the greatest pleasures of your life , mira .
as i was sleepy before we were far away from the prison ship . [male] took me on his back again and carried me home . he must have had a tiresome journey of it . for mr. [male] , being knocked up , was in such a very bad temper that if the church had been thrown open . he would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition , beginning with [male] and myself .
[female] had taken down his pipe from the shelf in the chimney corner . and was stuffing tobacco into the bowl , he went on pretending to do this a little while after it was filled . for , to tell the truth , he was beginning to feel uncomfortable at the new view of his conduct presented to him . still he was not going to let this appear , so lifting up his head with an indifferent air he lighted the pipe . blew into it , took it out and examined it as something were wrong about it .
oh , wings of the morning , here you come ! i have been looking out for you ever since post came . [male] is carrying orders into town . and will bring you this with a touch of the hat and an amused grin under it . i saw you right on the top sallis hill .
mr. [male] , the elder . died and left three sons , [male] , [male] , and [male] . as eldest son , [male] succeeded to the estate . if he died without leaving a son , the property went to the second brother , [male] . and if [male] died also without leaving a son , the property went to the third brother , [male] .
in the evening , the ladies , as usual , went to a private assembly . and , as usual , were attended to it by mr arnott . the other gentlemen had engagements elsewhere , several days passed on nearly in the same manner . the mornings were all spent in gossipping , shopping and dressing . and the evenings were regularly appropriated to public places , or large parties of company .
yet it pleased him , it pleased him very much . he felt the challenge in her very attire she challenged the whole world . and he smiled as to the note of a trumpet . [male] and [male] went through the house to the back . where were the stables and the out buildings , everywhere was still and deserted .
she did not complete the sentence , she saw firmin [female] 's face . and it was a terrible sight , he seemed ready to burst . he said nothing , he could not speak . but suddenly he acted , first , his left arm seized upon the quaint person of [female] . giry and made her describe so unexpected a semicircle that she uttered a despairing cry .
the unvarnished schoolroom records of greek and roman warfare had been as delightful to him as the finest passages of a [male] or a froude . a thiers or lamartine , he was a soldier by the inspiration of heaven . as all great soldiers are , he had never known any other ambition . or dreamed any other dream , other lads had talked of the bar . and the [organization] , and their glories , bah ! how cold and tame they seemed !
the clerk gave him a piercing look . glanced out of the window and saw that there were no other clients , then went to a desk at the farther end of his compartment . and took up some clerical work he had in hand . the high , vaulted room became resonant with voices and the blurred echoes of mingling footsteps on the marble floor . as passengers from the express hurried anxiously to the street .
the session went on very quietly , the question of the irish reform bill was postponed till the next year . which was a great thing gained , he carried his bill about [organization] . with sundry other small bills appertaining to it , through the house in a manner which redounded infinitely to his credit . there was just enough of opposition to give a zest to the work . and to make the affair conspicuous among the affairs of the year .
for ever i supposed that he had been too young and too tender to take upon him these adventures . and therefore by my will i would have driven him away for jealousy that i had of his life . for it may be no young knight 's deed that shall enchieve this adventure to the end . pardieu , said sir [male] , it is well said . and where ye are called the damosel maledisant i will call you the damosel bienpensant .
mr. [male] 's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family . they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve . the whole of what [male] had already heard , his claims on mr. [male] . and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed . and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr. [male] before they had known anything of the matter .
he saw the uncertainty in the mare 's ears and lifted the whip . but at the same time felt that his fears were groundless ; the mare knew what was wanted . she quickened her pace and rose smoothly . just as he had fancied she would , and as she left the ground gave herself up to the force of her rush . which carried her far beyond the ditch ; and with the same rhythm .
all those whom we have named managed to get over the brook , pollock 's horse barely contriving to get up his hind legs from the broken edge of the bank . some nags refused it , and their riders thus lost all their chance of sport for that day . such is the lot of men who hunt , a man pays five or six pounds for his day 's amusement . and it is ten to one that the occurrences of the day disgust rather than gratify him ! one or two got in , and scrambled out on the other side , but tufto pearlings .
d'artagnan followed [female] without being perceived by her , he saw her get into her carriage . and heard her order the coachman to drive togermain . it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful horses . [male] therefore returned to the rue ferou . in the rue [male] seine he met [male] .
they were not off the cobb , before the harvilles met them . captain [male] had been seen flying by their house , with a countenance which showed something to be wrong . and they had set off immediately , informed and directed as they passed , towards the spot . shocked as captain harville was , he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful . and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done .
one morning he took an opportunity . before her and miss woodley , to introduce and press the subject of sir [male] hopes . he first spoke warmly in his praise , then plainly said that he believed she possessed the power of making so deserving a man happy to the summit of his wishes . a laugh of ridicule was the only answer . but a sudden frown from dorriforth having put an end to it .
the village being small he had little difficulty in finding mrs durbeyfield 's tenement . which was a house in a walled garden , remote from the main road . where she had stowed away her clumsy old furniture as best she could . it was plain that for some reason or other she had not wished him to visit her . and he felt his call to be somewhat of an intrusion .
ay , the smart lad , he had done the best he could for the senorita . but , holy virgin , what had got into the senorita to run off like that . with an indian , -- even alessandro , the fiends had bewitched her , tirelessly [male] can questioned every traveller . every wandering herder he saw . no one knew anything of alessandro , beyond the fact that all the temecula indians had been driven out of their village .
i knew a woman that was so dexterous with a fellow . who indeed deserved no better usage , that while he was busy with her another way . conveyed his purse with twenty guineas in it out of his fob pocket . where he had put it for fear of her . and put another purse with gilded counters in it into the room of it .
guy 's birthday had fallen on a saturday . this was monday morning , we had driven over to [male] bury . [male] and i , at an unusually early hour . he did not exactly tell me why , but it was not difficult to guess . not difficult to perceive how strongly he was interested , even affected -- as any man .
when she had gone he went back and stood before the picture again . from clare 's first words he had had a stricken conviction that the thing was true . that , as mrs. [female] 's visitor from [location] had insisted . [male] had never married , never had a son , he stood and gazed at the picture . his world had collapsed about him , but he was steady and very erect .
rebecca retreated , her importunities had prevailed upon urfried to suffer her to quit the turret . and urfried had employed her services where she herself would most gladly have paid them . by the bedside of the wounded ivanhoe , with an understanding awake to their dangerous situation . and prompt to avail herself of each means of safety which occurred . [male] had hoped something from the presence of a man of religion .
emily was about to answer , hardly knowing what to say , when the door was opened and mrs. [female] came into the room . the lady was not announced , and [female] had heard no knock at the door . she was forced to go through some ceremony of introduction . this is my aunt , mrs. [female] , ', she said . `` aunt [female] , the duchess of omnium . ''
he waited until he heard the tiny bell in his watch tinkle the half hour . and then he set out slowly over the moonlit rocks to the north . [female] and [female] would surely come from that direction . it was impossible to miss them , he walked without sound in his moccasins . keeping close to the edge of the cliff so that he could look out over the bay .
i heard that your father had taken you away with him . but i felt sure that you could not live away from me for long , and when i met you in the champs elysees . i was a little upset , but by no means surprised , then began that series of days . each of them brought me a fresh insult from you . i received them all with a kind of joy .
levity so unfeeling , and a spirit of extravagance so irreclaimable . were hopeless prognostics ; yet [female] would not desist from her design . she therefore took the earliest opportunity of speaking with mr arnott upon the subject . when she openly expressed her uneasiness at the state of his brother 's affairs . and warmly acknowledged her displeasure at his dissipated way of life .
she had put [female] into the parlour with a promise that she would bring [male] to him there . and she was not going to break her word through any mock delicacy . the two young people liked one another , and they should have this opportunity of saying so in each other 's hearing . so she took [female] by the arm . and opening the door of the parlour led her into the room .
not until he was very near did yellow bird come out of the tepee . and it was then jolly [male] stopped short , a gasp on his lips . she was changed , her radiant hair was still down , polished smooth . but her face was whiter than he had ever seen it . and drawn and pinched almost as in the days of the famine .
the box of candy was all that could possibly be desired , it was ample for the needs of them all . including the two youths from the livery stable who had attached themselves to their party from the early morning . in fact , it was two boxes . one of the most delectable chocolates of all imaginable kinds , and the other of mixed candies and candied fruit . both boxes bore the magic name `` huyler 's ''
sir [male] , who had watched her as she queened it amongst rakes and fops and honest country squires and knights . had marked the vigour with which they plied her with an emotion which was a new sensation to his drink bemuddled brain . so far as it was in his nature to love another than himself . he had learned to love this young lovely virago of his own flesh and blood . perchance because she was the only creature who had never quailed before him .
either orlick , or the strange man who had shown me the file . it was horrible to think that i had provided the weapon . however undesignedly , but i could hardly think otherwise , i suffered unspeakable trouble while i considered and reconsidered whether i should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell [male] all the story . for months afterwards , i every day settled the question finally in the negative . and reopened and reargued it next morning , the contention came .
there was a reality of tragedy about him which for the moment overcame her . she had no joke ready , no sarcasm . no feminine counter grumble , little as she agreed with him when he spoke of the necessity of retiring into private life because a man had written to him such a letter as this . incapable as she was of understanding fully the nature of the irritation which tormented him . still she knew that he was suffering , and acknowledged to herself that she had been the cause of the agony .
so far at least he was [male] , but he did not add that they were things he did not himself believe . things that he accounted the cant by which an ambitious bourgeoisie . speaking through the mouths of the lawyers , who were its articulate part . sought to overthrow to its own advantage the present state of things . he left his audience in the natural belief that the views he expressed were the views he held .
why did [female] , insist upon it in such a manner ? a very simple reason -- his heart was not at rest . his mind was not thoroughly convinced ; he imagined there lay some dark . hidden , tortuous intrigue behind these thirteen millions of francs . and he wished that the pure heart of [male] valliere .
no factory bells that morning ; no early workmen going to their labours . no slip shod girls cleaning the windows of the little shops which broke the monotony of the street . instead , you might see here and there some operative sallying forth for a breath of country air . or some father leading out his wee toddling bairns for the unwonted pleasure of a walk with `` daddy , '' in the clear frosty morning , men with more leisure on week days would perhaps have walked quicker than they did through the fresh sharp air of this sunday morning .
but the three days rest was good in spite of it all . for it had given my knee the very chance it needed . it felt much better , the swelling had materially decreased , and the cap seemed descending into its proper place . also , the three days rest brought the trouble i had foreseen . it was plainly [male] intention to make me pay for those three days .
phoebe sat by a fount ; sitting by a fount i spied her . sweet her touch , rare her voice . touch and voice what may distain you ? as she sung i did sigh , and by sighs whilst that i tried her . o mine eyes , you did lose her first sight whose want did pain you .
his enemy had got him , and that enemy was a woman ! moreover , after she had blown away a part of his head and had him helpless in the sand . she had -- in place of finishing him there . dragged him to this cool nook and tied up his wound . it was hard for him to believe , but the pail of water .
but they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs . and so they took him into the wing and put him in the room that had been madame schoss ' . [location] 's last day had come , it was a clear bright autumn day , a sunday . the church bells everywhere were ringing for service . just as usual on sundays , nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city .
most of the taxis is swalowed up in the mud , theys only two or three runnin now . only the big strong fellos can get to town , the cook says its the old theory of the arrival of the fittest . but i guess you dont know nothin about cience , mable . when i go to town i wrap my blouze in a newspaper . if they know your goin they give you a list of things to get that looks like a chinese message to [organization] .
whether it was from respect , envy , or anticipation . he did not know , [male] 's whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable . in the society in which prince [male] lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and self assurance . he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half closed . rather humid eyes , or so firm a smile that expressed nothing .
when mrs. french hesitated , and then expostulated , [female] replied that she did not expect to be married above once . and that in no cheaper or more productive way than this could her mother allow her to consume her share of the family resources . what matter , mamma , if you do have to borrow a little money ? mr. [male] will let you have it when he knows why . and as i sha not be eating and drinking at home any more .
[female] had trifled with her feelings ; but she had very long allowed and even sought his attentions . with a jealousy of her sister so reasonable as ought to have been their cure . and now that the conviction of his preference for maria had been forced on her . she submitted to it without any alarm for maria 's situation . or any endeavour at rational tranquillity for herself , she either sat in gloomy silence .
after all , is it not the teaching of [male] ? and what is an idea , if not the germ of action in the material world . all men are equal in spirit , they are all sons of god . whence then this obvious disquality ? it was a religious creed pushed to its material conclusion . [male] at least had no answer , he could but admit .
through the open window he could hear , in the mild december stillness . his horse 's feet coming and going on the gravel . her horse , led up and down by her servant , at the door of her house ! ... the sound symbolized his whole future ... the situation his marriage had made for him . and to which he must henceforth bend , unless he broke with it then and there ...
i saw by the look in [male] 's eyes . however , as he gazed away from me to the long necked dragon form of a huge derrick . that it did matter , i had been tactful . i had mentioned the mistake in identity as if it were a silly game played by children . a game which neither he nor i nor any one could ever have regarded seriously .
slowly and carefully , therefore , i gained my feet , only to see that my watcher did the same . cautiously i advanced toward him , finding that by moving with a shuffling gait i could retain my balance as well as make reasonably rapid progress . as i neared the brute he backed cautiously away from me . and when i had reached the open he moved to one side to let me pass . he then fell in behind me and followed about ten paces in my rear as i made my way along the deserted street .
she answered with a smile ; a mournful smile . but full of sisterly affection , as she looked in her sister 's face . and listened to the quiet music of her voice , picturing the happiness of this return . her own face glowed with hope and joy . [male] , in spite of his system of philosophy -
these elegiac moods were not made for lethierry , neither the nature of his temperament nor the character of his misfortune suited those delicate shades . but at the moment at which we have returned to him . the reverie of his first despair had for more than a week been tending to disperse . without , however , leaving him less sad , he was more inactive . was always dull ; but he was no longer overwhelmed , a certain perception of events and circumstances was returning to him .
the crowd on tynwald had now gathered thick down the neck of the enclosure and dense round the mount . to the strains of the national anthem , played by the band of the regiment . the governor had come out of the church , he was in cocked hat and with sword . and the sword of state was carried upright before him . with his keys , council , and clergy .
he really believed in the spiritual advantages , and meant that his life henceforth should be the more devoted because of those later sins which he represented to himself as hypothetic . praying hypothetically for their pardon : -- if i have herein transgressed , as to the hospital . he avoided saying anything further to [male] . fearing to manifest a too sudden change of plans immediately on the death of [male] . in his secret soul he believed that [male] suspected his orders to have been intentionally disobeyed .
mrs. beauchamp was surprised and affected ; she knew not what to say . she foresaw the agony this interview would occasion mr. [male] . who had just arrived in search of his [male] , and yet was sensible that the pardon and blessing of her father would soften even the agonies of death to the daughter . the ardent manner in which he uttered these words occasioned him to raise his voice . it caught the ear of [female] .
the coach drew up ; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers . the guard and coachman loudly urged haste . my trunk was hoisted up ; i was taken from bessie 's neck . to which i clung with kisses , `` be sure and take good care of her , '' cried she to the guard , as he lifted me into the inside .
the queen had at first positively refused ; but at length became afraid that the duke . if exasperated , would commit some folly , she had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure . when , on the very evening of coming to this decision , [male] . [male] . who was charged with going to [male] the duke and conducting him to the louvre , was abducted . for two days no one knew what had become of her .
[female] was too ill through the rest of that day for any questions to be addressed to her . too ill even to think with any distinctness of the evils that were to come . she only felt that all her hope was crushed , and that instead of having found a refuge she had only reached the borders of a new wilderness where no goal lay before her . the sensations of bodily sickness , in a comfortable bed . and with the tendance of the good natured landlady , made a sort of respite for her .
the grangers and mr. [male] went on meeting in society . and [male] , with whom it was a kind of habit to ask men to dinner . could hardly avoid inviting [male] , it might have seemed invidious to do so ; and for what reason should he make such a distinction ? even to himself mr. [male] would not be willing to confess that he was jealous of this man . so mr. [male] came with others of his species to the gorgeous caravanserai in the rue [male] morny .
following his gaze to the south west , we saw it coming . it was a cloud mass that blotted out the sunlight and the day . it seemed to swell and belch and roll over and over on itself as it advanced with a rapidity that told of enormous wind behind it and in it . its speed was headlong , terrific ; and , beneath it . covering the sea , advancing with it , was a gray bank of mist .
in that space [female] looked at jeanne . her face was against his breast , her eyes met his own . and in that last moment , face to face with death . love leaped above all fear , they were about to die , and jeanne would die in his arms . she was his now -- forever , his hold tightened , her face came nearer .
straight off , we were in the country , it was most lovely and [male] in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning in the first freshness of autumn . from hilltops we saw fair green valleys lying spread out below . with streams winding through them , and island groves of trees here and there . and huge lonely oaks scattered about and casting [male] blots of shade . and beyond the valleys we saw the ranges of hills .
here sir [male] felt some little surprise , and a touch of mortification . on beholding the aspect of things , he had expected to find [male] pensive . unhappy , perhaps ill , he had expected to see her agitated at his coming . he had pondered much upon the cessation of her letters . and he had told himself that she had ceased to write because she was angry with him .
his capability and discretion made them feel that roscarna was not so disreputable and outlandish after all . he scarcely mentioned gabrielle , except as the only witness of the accident . and the radway family returned to england with their son 's body . satisfied that he had gone to roscarna for the grouse shooting on the invitation of people who . in spite of their questionable appearance , were actually connected with the halbertons .
he dragged off his coat and his waistcoat . and threw his braces over his shoulders , then he stumbled . and he had to lay hold of the bedpost . his hand grew chill and relaxed its hold . stupor came over him , he slipped .
evening : `` make up your bed , '' [male] made his . `` wash any dirty dishes , '' he had a few so he washed them . `` sweep your floor , '' he swept , `` always prepare at least one hot thing for supper . '' he shook the gasoline tank to the little stove . it sounded full enough , so he went to the cupboard his mother had made from a small packing case .
after all , if supper was to be served at nine , someone must be expected to eat it . i should surely not be left much longer without companions , meanwhile ample amusement awaited me in the contemplation of a picture which . next to the large fireplace , was the most prominent object in the room . this picture was a portrait , and a remarkable one . the countenance it portrayed was both characteristic and forcible , and so interested me that in studying it i quite forgot both hunger and weariness .
madame [male] menon . who loved [male] with maternal affection , was an interested observer of all that passed at the castle . the cruel fate to which the marquis destined his daughter she had severely lamented . yet she could hardly rejoice to find that this had been avoided by elopement , she trembled for the future safety of her pupil . and her tranquillity , which was thus first [female] for the welfare of others .
here all the sarcasm passed from her voice , the defiance from her eye . and the one unspoiled attribute which still lingered in this woman 's artful nature shone in her face . as she turned toward [female] and [female] at their mother 's side . there was no reply , but [female] 's indignant eyes fell before hers . [female] half put out her hand .
what was i to do ? to be brutally beaten , to be killed perhaps . would not help my case , i looked steadily into the cruel grey eyes . they might have been granite for all the light and warmth of a human soul they contained . one may see the soul stir in some men 's eyes . but his were bleak , and cold , and grey as the sea itself .
dantes heard joyfully the key grate in the lock . he listened until the sound of steps died away . and then , hastily displacing his bed , saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell . that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it . the damp had rendered it friable , and dantes was able to break it off .
my arabic was not equal to the strain of catching all the gabble that followed . the old man protesting that it was right to close the house today . that if it were the police and not thieves who broke in . it was unjust , it was cruel , and his son [male] . the caretaker , would appeal to all the powers , before he had come to the end of his first breath .
upon the whole the rejected lover liked it . at any rate it was better so than being alone and moody and despised of all people . he would know now how to get away from granpere without having to plan a surreptitious escape . of course he had come out intending to be miserable , to be known as an ill used man who had been treated with an amount of cruelty surpassing all that had ever been told of in love histories . to be depressed by the weight of the ill usage which he had borne was a part of the play which he had to act .
as my act and deed , love feeds on many kinds of food . i know , some love for rank . some for duty : some give their hearts away for empty show . and others for youth and beauty . to love for money all the world is prone .
levin certainly was out of humor , and in spite of all his desire to be affectionate and cordial to his charming visitor . he could not control his mood , the intoxication of the news that [male] was not married had gradually begun to work upon him . [male] was not married , but ill , and ill from love for a man who had slighted her . this slight , as it were , rebounded upon him , vronsky had slighted her . and she had slighted him , levin . consequently vronsky had the right to despise levin .
after a minute or two he put out his hand to take that of alexandrina . they were to be married now in a week or two , and such a sign of love might have been allowed to him . even in the presence of the bride 's mother . he did succeed in getting hold of her fingers . but found in them none of the softness of a response .
now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing . that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough . and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave . emma 's pensive meditations , as she walked home . were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her .
her eyes were full of tears , as she followed miss browning into this room to see it under its new aspect . nearly everything was changed -- the position of the bed and the colour of the furniture . there was a grand toilette table now , with a glass upon it , instead of the primitive substitute of the top of a chest of drawers . with a mirror above upon the wall , sloping downwards . these latter things had served her mother during her short married life .
[female] felt that although [female] was a tremendously decent fellow and his brother . he was not pliable enough to suit his needs , he was too outspoken . too inclined to take issue , if [male] yielded to his father 's wishes . and took possession of his share of the estate . he would become , necessarily , an active partner in the affairs of the company .
both bowed to the inexorable truth : they knew that [organization] never changed her mind . and that in her case a resolve once taken was equivalent to an act performed . there was a long silence between them ; then mattie said in a low voice . do not be too sorry , ethan , oh , god -- oh , god , ', he groaned . the glow of passion he had felt for her had melted to an aching tenderness .
this man , dressed in a citizen costume buttoned up like a military pourpoint . a very small hat on his head , but a long shagreen mounted sword by his side . turned his head as soon as he heard the steps of the horses . and left off looking at the house to look at the dragoons , it was simply [male] . [male] on foot ; [male] with his hands behind him .
the first monuments were simple masses of rock . `` which the iron had not touched , '' as [male] says , architecture began like all writing . it was first an alphabet , men planted a stone upright . it was a letter , and each letter was a hieroglyph . and upon each hieroglyph rested a group of ideas .
a few days afterwards , -- it might have been at eight o'clock in the evening . he was in his room , and engaged in making cosette spell aloud . when he heard the house door open and then shut again . this struck him as singular , the old woman . who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself .
fanny stood aghast , as no scandalous , ill natured rumour had reached her , it was impossible for her to understand much of this strange letter . she could only perceive that it must relate to wimpole street and mr. [male] . and only conjecture that something very imprudent had just occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world . and to excite her jealousy , in miss [female] 's apprehension . if she heard it , miss [female] need not be alarmed for her .
there is always something to be given up even when our brightest visions are realised . there is always some one figure missing in the fullest sum of earthly happiness . i dare say if alnaschar had married the vizier 's daughter , he would have found her a shrew . and would have looked back yearningly to the humble days in which he had been an itinerant vendor of crockery ware . if , therefore , [female] found her sunlit fancies not quite realised by the great stony mansion that frowned upon the fenny countryside .
as she had half expected , the dresser was full of lingerie . of the finest lawn and linen , the dainty garments were edged with real lace . [location] , valenciennes , mechlin , point d'alencon . and the fine irish laces , sometimes there was a cluster of tucks . daintily run by hand , but , usually , only the lace , unless there was a bit of insertion to match .
the excursion to the [male] pass . however , had an after effect which was not so [male] , either the high elevation had disagreed with [male] . or he had taken a little cold ; at all events . he was distinctly less well , with the lowering of his physical forces came a corresponding depression of spirits . mrs. [female] worried him .
the minister waited for some moments after [female] had spoken . and then said , in a voice grave and with a feeling of responsibility in it . you have heard these brethren , my people . i wait for the expression of your desire . like one man the great congregation rose to their feet .
the blast went by , and the moon contended with the fast flying clouds . and the wild disorder reigning up there made the pitiful little tumults in the streets of no account . it was not that the wind swept all the brawlers into places of shelter . as it had swept the hail still lingering in heaps wherever there was refuge for it . but that it seemed as if the streets were absorbed by the sky .
he started , looked guilty , stammered something about baggage . said he would return in a moment , and rushed aimlessly away , his ears fiery . `` i am all kinds of a fool , '' he muttered . as he raced around the baggage room and then back to where he had left the two ladies . mr. [male] had joined them and they were preparing to depart .
so they amused themselves for the rest of the evening with music . and lady thryng 's face lost the strained and harassed expression it had worn all during dinner . and took on a look of contentment , after this the days were spent by [male] in going over his uncle 's large mass of papers and correspondence . with the aid of mr. [male] and a secretary . a colossal task it proved to be .
when emil alighted at the shabatas gate , his horse was in a lather . he tied her in the stable and hurried to the house . it was empty , she might be at mrs. [female] 's or with alexandra . but anything that reminded him of her would be enough . the orchard , the mulberry tree ...
the scene was eerie in the extreme , and [male] gazed in fascinated interest at the rigid figure on the bed . enrico had been a handsome man in life . and with the passing of his evil soul his earthly dignity of aspect had increased . the head was lying well back and showed the noble sweep of the brow and the clean cut profile of the high bridged nose . a full beard , raven [male] and threaded here and there with grey .
the winter was severe , the windows every morning were covered with rime . and the light shining through them , dim as through ground glass . sometimes did not change the whole day long , at four o'clock the lamp had to be lighted . on fine days she went down into the garden . the dew had left on the cabbages a silver lace with long transparent threads spreading from one to the other .
annesley admired his cleverness in touching the goal . but somehow these smart hits [female] rather than amused her . [female] 's complexity was a puzzle to her . she could not understand , despite his explanations , why these fireworks of dexterity were worth while . [female] was a brave figure of romance .
`` 'nuptiarum expers , ' that 's what it is , i suppose , try it again . '' the advice on the part of the [male] was genuine and unselfish . that mr. [male] of [organization] should be rejected by a young lady without any fortune seemed to him to be impossible . at any rate it is the duty of a man in such circumstances to persevere . as far as [male] knew the world , ladies always required to be asked a second or a third time .
the letter was very short , and may , perhaps , be described as having been almost curt . mr. [male] , in his anxiety to do the best he could for mr. [male] . had simply asked a question as to the nature of the transaction between the two gentlemen . saying that no doubt the dean 's answer would clear up a little mystery which existed at present respecting a cheque for twenty pounds . the dean in answer simply stated the fact as it has been given above .
had a general dim resemblance to human listeners . especially where a shiny [male] sou'wester suit and hat hung . looking very like a clumsy mariner with his back to the company . who was so curious to overhear , that he paused for the purpose with his coat half pulled on . and his shoulders up to his ears in the uncompleted action .
lady audley went from the garden to the library . a [male] , oak paneled , homely apartment in which sir [male] liked to sit reading or writing . or arranging the business of his estate with his steward . a stalwart countryman , half agriculturalist , half lawyer . who rented a small farm a few miles from the court .
and it was not , the northern quadrant was a great fen of colour and cloud . that spread ribs of feathery pink . fleece frilled , from the horizon to the zenith , it was all amazing . four sunsets at the one time in the sky ! each quadrant glowed , and burned , and pulsed with a sunset distinctly its own .
there would always be a barrier between them , not only on harvey 's side . there were things she had no right to tell -- of [male] . of his love and care for her , and of that last terrible day when he realized what he had done . that night , lying in the new bed , she faced that situation too . how much was she to blame ? if [male] felt that each life lost was lost by him was not the same true for her ?
and in that bitter cry the lad 's heart melted again . it was such a tender heart . his mother 's heart , after a time he recovered himself . and came down with me to breakfast , as he had insisted upon doing ; met them all . even miss silver -- and [female] , who had placed himself by her side with an air of right .
the elder man was seated on the ground in the shade of an oak . with his back against the trunk of the tree . while the boy lay full length on the soft grass . looking up into the green depths of foliage where a tiny brown bird flitted from bough to bough . in his quaint way , pete was carrying on a conversation with his little friend in the tree top .
how much i seem to have written about count [female] ! and what does it all amount to ? -- as poor , dear mr. [male] would ask . in his impenetrable business like way i can only repeat that i do assuredly feel . even on this short acquaintance , a strange , half willing , half unwilling liking for the count . he seems to have established over me the same sort of ascendency which he has evidently gained over sir [male] .
sandford could not say yes , and was ashamed to say no ; he , therefore , made answer only by his looks . which were full of suspicion , she , notwithstanding , made him a very low courtesy . her guardian then handed her out of the apartment into her coach . which was waiting to take her , miss woodley , and himself , home . as the carriage moved slowly through a lane between elmwood castle and her own house .
having turned the key , he stopped at the door to listen to their proceedings . he distinguished the voices of two men . and knew them to be those of the assassins , presently he heard a piercing skriek . and at the same instant the voices of the ruffians grew loud and violent . one of them exclaimed that the lady was dying , and accused the other of having frightened her to death .
during the five years of this seclusion , which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man . [male] , had he not affected to brave the cardinal . despise princes , and walk alone without adherents or disciples . would either have regained his liberty or made partisans , but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister . after having failed in poetry , [male] beaufort tried drawing .
`` i think being engaged is very bad for the character , '' she shook her purse in her hand until the coins jingled . as if she alluded merely to this example of her forgetfulness . but the remark puzzled [female] ; it seemed to refer to something else . and her manner had changed so strangely , now that [female] was out of hearing . that she could not help looking at her for an explanation , she looked almost stern .
at dinner that day , although the occasion was not foreseen and provided for . a brilliant company of such as are not made of the dust of the earth . but of some superior article for the present unknown , shed their lustrous benediction upon mr [male] 's daughter 's marriage . and mr [female] 's daughter that day began . in earnest , her competition with that woman not present .
it was evident that booth 's edge was becoming more and more a harbour for priests . owing largely to [female] marjorie 's courage and piety . it was well placed ; it was remote ; and it had so far avoided all suspicion . padley certainly served for many , but padley was nearer the main road . and besides , had fallen under the misfortune of losing its master for the very crime of recusancy .
yet her mother 's health and spirits were such as to render it unadvisable that the old woman should be too much left alone . and [female] 's devotion to her own mother seemed to point her out as the very person who could be a gentle and tender companion to [female] rose during those hours when her own daughter would necessarily be engaged in the shop . many desirable objects seemed to be gained by this removal of [female] . an occupation was provided for [female] , which would detain her in the place where her husband had left her . and where ( [male] foster fairly expected in spite of his letter ) .
when i said good night and went below it was with the feeling that i had been talking with the one half of some sort of a dual creature . the other half had not spoken , yet i sensed it there , fluttering and quick . behind the mask of words and flesh , but i could not sleep . i took more cream of tartar , it must be the heat of the bed clothes . i decided , that excited my hives , and yet , whenever i ceased struggling for sleep .
i can not say but i had some reflections in this affair upon the dishonourable forsaking my faithful citizen . who loved me sincerely , and who was endeavouring to quit himself of a scandalous whore by whom he had been indeed barbarously used . and promised himself infinite happiness in his new choice . which choice was now giving up herself to another in a manner almost as scandalous as hers could be . but the glittering shoe of a great estate , and of fine things .
i am afraid this sketch of a special envoy 's career will scarcely tempt you to exchange for a mission abroad ! and you are quite right , my dear friend , it is a very unrewarding profession . i often wish myself that i had taken something in the [location] . or gone into the church , or some other career which had given me time and opportunity to look after my health . of which , by the way , i have but an indifferent account to render you .
on a chair by the bedside were all my own things . clean and dry , my [male] silk frock hung against the wall . the traces of the bog were removed from it . the creases left by the wet smoothed out : it was quite decent . my very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered presentable , there were the means of washing in the room .
here at the outset his inexperience met him . his voice , pitched too low , only reached those directly near him , it was a moment of great strain . eve , listening intently , drew a long breath of suspense and let her fingers drop apart . the sceptical , watchful eyes that faced him , line upon line . seemed to flash and brighten with critical interest ; only fraide made no change of expression .
write me one word by your own hand , forgiven . it is all i ask , when it reaches me . i will come to you at once , do not dictate a letter to your secretary . i could not bear it , just write -- if you can truly write it , 'forgiven ' . and send it to `` your wife , ' '' the room was very still .
the wondrous strength of her will , her wrist of steel . and the fierce , pitiless punishment she inflicted . actually daunting the devilish creature 's courage , she would ride from the encounter . through two lines of people who had been watching her -- and some of them found themselves following after her . even to the park gate -- almost awed as they looked at her .
he could not use his short sword to advantage because i was too close to him . nor could he draw his pistol , which he attempted to do in direct opposition to martian custom which says that you may not fight a fellow warrior in private combat with any other than the weapon with which you are attacked . in fact he could do nothing but make a wild and futile attempt to dislodge me . with all his immense bulk he was little if any stronger than i . and it was but the matter of a moment or two before he sank .
i had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition . too well i remembered the perfidious hints given by mrs. [female] about my disposition , and [male] . the promise pledged by mr. [male] to apprise miss temple and the teachers of my vicious nature . all along i had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise . i had been looking out daily for the `` coming man , '' whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever .
to the two pretty english girls , lady [female] and [female] . she addressed several sentences ; as she left them . both , and especially the latter , seemed to glow all over with gratification , they were afterwards accosted by several ladies . and a little circle of gentlemen gathered round them . amongst these -- the nearest to [female] -- stood the count [female] hamal .
but for the wide , weathered porch they could have ridden up to it and knocked on its panels from the saddle . [male] was for going to the kitchen door . a suggestion which the duke scorned , he did not want to meet that girl at a kitchen door . even her own kitchen door , for that he was about to meet her . there was no doubt in him that moment .
sally had gone to the small mirror which hung in a corner of the kitchen . and was hastily smoothing her hair and setting her frilled cap at its most becoming angle over her dark curls . then she took up the tankards by their handles . three in each strong , brown hand , and laughing , grumbling , blushing . carried them through into the coffee room .
but she said in a firm voice , `` no , you are mistaken . '' then gently , and almost as caressing her , he passed his hand over her stomach . she uttered a sharp cry , he fell back terror stricken . then she began to groan , faintly at first , her shoulders were shaken by a strong shuddering . and she was growing paler than the sheets in which her clenched fingers buried themselves .
and hurrying his daughter in his turn , he conducted her from the lists . and by means of conveyance which he had provided . transported her safely to the house of the rabbi [female] . the jewess , whose fortunes had formed the principal interest of the day . having now retired unobserved , the attention of the populace was transferred to the [female] knight .
it was inconceivable that he should have hurt a woman . he would rather be eaten by wild beasts than see her move on the ground as she had moved in the orchard . why had she been so careless ? she knew he was like a crazy man when he was angry . she had more than once taken that gun away from him and held it . when he was angry with other people , once it had gone off while they were struggling over it .
it might indeed have escaped the attention even of those who had stood at its very opening . so uninviting was the portal at which the beggar entered , but within , the cavern was higher and more roomy . cut into two separate branches , which , intersecting each other at right angles , formed an emblem of the cross . and indicated the abode of an anchoret of former times . there are many caves of the same kind in different parts of [location] .
sailors and relatives , shall { we } submit ? are { we } but slaves ? they they love comes alike to high and low . [location] 's sailors rule the waves . and shall they stoop to insult ? no , all , of life , alas ! his leave he 's taking , for ah ! his faithful heart is breaking ; when he is gone we will surely tell the maid that .
our route lay through [location] , [location] and [location] . and as we had heard rumors that the indians were on the war path and were kicking up something of a rumpus in [location] . indian territory and [location] , we expected trouble before we again had the pleasure of sitting around our fire at the home ranch . quite a large party was selected for this trip owing to the size of the herd and the possibility of trouble on the trail from the indians . we , as usual , were all well armed and had as mounts the best horses our ranch produced .
he waited , he could hear her moving about quickly in her room . an interval of silence followed , another five minutes passed . ten -- fifteen , he tapped at the door again . this time it was opened , he stared . amazed at the change in marette , she had stepped back from the door to let him enter .
just what her brother advocates in sunday school , for others . an ideal marriage , you think you are awfully funny . do not you ? humph , i do more for the church . for education , art , science than all the rest of the family combined . incidentally , i am not divorced ... but this is a practical world , [female] , i have got to protect my own .
hate was washed out of her soul and had left it cool and white as the lotus of the blessed one . what power had dwaymenau to hurt her when that other power walked beside her ? she seemed to float above her in high air and look down upon her with compassion . strength , virtue flowed in her veins . weakness , fear were fantasies .
then the girl hastened her slow , gliding movements , drew splint chairs to a table of rough pine that stood against the side of the room . and , stooping between him and the fire , pulled something from among the hot ashes . the fire made the only light in the room . and [female] never forgot the supple [female] of her as she bent thus silhouetted . the perfect line of chin and throat [female] against the blaze .
he opened his eyes and looked on the feast she had set before him . the pink rose was still in her hair , and one at her throat . and two perfect ones were in a glass near his plate . the table was drawn close to his bedside , and strawberries were upon it . and a glass pitcher of cream .
christine stopped and laid her head on [female] 's shoulder . they sat like that for a moment , in silence . and they did not see , did not perceive the movement , at a few steps from them . of the creeping shadow of two great [female] wings . a shadow that came along the roof so near , so near them that it could have stifled them by closing over them .
five days after the death of [male] . mr. [male] was standing at his leisure under the large archway leading into the yard of the green dragon . he was not fond of solitary contemplation . but he had only just come out of the house , and any human figure standing at ease under the archway in the early afternoon was as certain to attract companionship as a pigeon which has found something worth peeking at . in this case there was no material object to feed upon .
the winter passed by , little teddy grew and throve , and [male] sloane worshipped him . [male] was very good to him , too , and teddy was just as fond of her as of [female] . nevertheless , as the spring drew near , [male] became depressed , sometimes he sighed heavily . especially when he heard casual references to the josiah spencer emigration . one warm afternoon in early may josiah spencer arrived , he found [male] knitting placidly in the kitchen .
she was going back to the house slowly , tearless , but with something like despair in her heart . when she heard the orchard gate open again . he had come back , perhaps , -- returned to forgive and pity her , no , that was not his footstep . it was mr. [male] , looking unspeakably ponderous and commonplace in the moonlight . as he came across the shadowy grass towards her .
they were all three walking about together for an hour or two -- first round the shrubberies of hartfield . and afterwards in highbury , he was delighted with every thing . admired hartfield sufficiently for mr. [male] 's ear . and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village . and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than [male] could have supposed .
mrs. [female] was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures . every idea gave way to the charm of recollection . and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else . fatigued as she had been by the morning 's walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in [female] of her former acquaintance . and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years ', discontinuance .
i tramped on , and leaving the lake , half unconsciously struck into the wood beyond the dividing wall . where snow-covered leaves and twigs rattled and broke under my tread . i came out into an open space beyondagatha 's , found the walk and turned toward home . as i neared the main entrance to the school the door opened and a woman came out under the overhanging lamp . she carried a lantern , and turned with a hand outstretched to some one who followed her with careful steps .
jill kissed him and moved away , she busied herself with some flowers . her back turned , the tension had been relieved , and she wanted to give him time to recover his poise . she knew him well enough to be sure that , sooner or later , the resiliency of his nature would assert itself . he could never remain long in the depths , the silence had the effect of making her think more clearly than in the first rush of pity she had been able to do . she was able now to review the matter as it affected herself .
he inhabited a house built by himself . near the church ofleu , in the ruedenys . where his forge was well known to half the amateurs of fine jewelry . he was a man of pure morals and persevering industry . always laboring , always improving , constantly learning new secrets and new receipts .
anguish remained with them for half an hour , when he left the castle it was with a more hopeful feeling in his breast . in the princess 's bed chamber late that night . two girls , in loose , silken gowns sat before a low fire and talked of something that caused the countess to tremble with excitement when first her pink cheeked sovereign mentioned it in confidence . [female] 's cell was as comfortable as a cell could be made through the efforts of a kindly jailer and a sympathetic chief of police . it was not located in the dungeon , but high in the tower .
she led the way to the door . and manning passed behind her and round her and opened the door for her , when capes glanced up at them for a moment . manning seemed to be holding his arms all about her , and there was nothing but quiet acquiescence in her bearing . after capes had finished the scotchman 's troubles he went back into the preparation room . he sat down on the sill of the open window .
but he belonged to another woman , and she might not let him stay . there was just one thing to be thankful for , she had knowledge of her father in heaven . and she knew what [female] endeavor meant . she could take that with her out into the desert . and no one could take it from her , one wish she had .
miss harrel could talk of nothing else . neither was [female] disposed to change the subject , for the remains of insanity which seemed to hang upon him were affecting without being alarming . and her desire to know more of him grew every instant stronger . this desire , however , outlived not the conversation to which it gave rise . when she returned to her own room , no vestige of it remained upon her mind .
the journey had been particularly jolly : both susy and lansing had had too long a discipline in the art of smoothing things over not to make a special effort to hide from each other the ravages of their first disagreement . but , deep down and invisible , the disagreement remained ; and compunction for having been its cause gnawed at susy 's bosom as she sat in her tapestried and vaulted bedroom . brushing her hair before a tarnished mirror , she loved luxury . splendid things always made her feel handsome and high ceilings arrogant . she did not remember having ever before been oppressed by the evidences of wealth .
she was too weak to be angry long ; her wrath sank away to feeble sobbing and worn-out moans . [female] was most anxious to soothe her from any violence of either grief or anger . she did so want her to be clear in her recollection . and , besides , her tenderness was great towards [female] 's mother . so she spoke in a low gentle tone the loving sentences .
this is it , i shall seek out forty steady , firm men . recruited among people a little compromised , but having habits of discipline . i shall promise them five hundred livres for a month if they return . nothing if they do not return , or half for their kindred . as to food and lodging , that concerns the english , who have cattle in their pastures .
of course , beverly sobbed a little in the effort to convince them that she did not care whom they accused . if he proved to be the right man in the end . they left her alone on the balcony . for an hour after midnight she sat there and dreamed . everyone was ready to turn against baldos , even she had been harsh toward him .
one morning his impatience overcame him . and he got out of bed , but , being on his feet . his head reeled , his limbs trembled , he clutched at the bed post . and had to clamber back , oh god , bear me witness . this delay is not my fault , he murmured .
he went on until he came to where the beaten trail swept up and away from a swamp . as vividly as if it had happened but yesterday , he remembered how he had dragged himself through this swamp . bleeding and starving , his violin clutched to his breast . guided by the barking of dogs , which seemed to come from a million miles away . he plunged into it now , picking his tangled way until he stood upon a giant ridge .
i did my best -- which was bad , i know : it provoked [male] , he fumed . putting both -- hands to the work , i endeavoured to do better than my best . i presume he gave me credit for good intentions . he professed to be partially content , `` ca ira , '' he cried ; and as voices began sounding from the garden . and white dresses fluttering among the trees , he added .
numbers of men in every profession and trade would be blighted by his insolvency . old people who had been in easy circumstances all their lives would have no place of repentance for their trust in him but the workhouse . legions of women and children would have their whole future desolated by the hand of this mighty scoundrel . every partaker of his magnificent feasts would be seen to have been a sharer in the plunder of innumerable homes . every servile worshipper of riches who had helped to set him on his pedestal .
he left the skeleton among the crabs . with the remains of the devil fish beside it . while he had been occupied with the devil fish and the skeleton , the rising tide had submerged the entrance to the cave . he was only enabled to leave it by plunging under the arched entrance . he got through without difficulty ; for he knew the entrance well .
my heart leaped within me for joy when i heard his voice at the door . even before i saw him ; but let any one judge what kind of motion i found in my soul . when after having made a short excuse for his not coming , he showed me that his time had been employed on my account . that he had obtained a favourable report from the recorder to the secretary of state in my particular case . and , in short , that he had brought me a reprieve .
yes , verily , my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards . adapting your catechism to the occasion , and by god 's help so you must . for when we have got things to the pass that with an enormous treasure at disposal to relieve the poor . the best of the poor detest our mercies , hide their heads from us . and shame [male] by starving to death in the midst of us .
`` how long were you with mr. [male] , bates ? '' i inquired , as i followed him into the hall . he led the way , holding the cluster of lights high for my guidance up the broad stairway . the hall above shared the generous lines of the whole house . but the walls were white and hard to the eye , rough planks had been laid down for a floor .
the new arrival , who was just about to enter , saw their anxious faces in the doorway and the gleam of the west in their spectacles because they confronted the last rays of day . but they could only see his shape against the light . o , my boy , my boy . home again at last , cried mrs clare . who cared no more at that moment for the stains of heterodoxy which had caused all this separation than for the dust upon his clothes .
`` i do not fear , '' she assured him . and if her face continued white , her eyes grew steady , her voice was resolute . `` then come , '' he repeated , and she obeyed him instantly now as if to prove the absence of all fear . side by side they passed up the gangway and mounted the steps of the companion to the poop . their approach watched by the group that was in possession of it with glances at once of astonishment and resentment .
since his return , mrs. [female] had come back to her salon . she looked haggard ; but she did what she could to look otherwise . she was always polite to colville , and she was politely cordial with the clergyman . [female] saw her driving out with him and [organization] . they appeared to make excursions , and he had an impression .
upon the whole the idea pleased him well , particularly when he noticed the forlorn look of his sailor son as he walked about the place . and pictured the inevitably jarring effect of fiddles and tambourines upon [male] 's shattered nerves at such a crisis . even if the notes of the former were dulled by the application of a mute . and [male] shut up in a distant bedroom -- a plan which had at first occurred to him . he therefore told [male] that the surcharged larder was to be emptied by the charitable process above alluded to .
the two were unwilling to make any further answer , as they saw that his anger was kindling . in short , then , he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without showing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions . and during this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips . the curate and the barber , on the point he maintained . that knights errant were what the world stood most in need of , and that in him was to be accomplished the revival of knight errantry .
the autumn months were gone ; december had come and `` christmas was coming , '' the negroes far and near had counted the days which must pass before their expected holidays . in [female] kitchen there was much talking and laughing , fixing and fussing . and some crying , had you asked the cause of the crying . you would have been told that miss [female] was to be married christmas eve . and the week following she would leave them and start for [location] .
they walked down waterloo place and along pall mall . in trafalgar square there was a demonstration . and [female] lingered in the crowd so long that when they arrived at charing cross . esther found that she could not get to ludgate hill in time to catch her train . so they went into the embankment gardens .
as the door opened he saw her sitting within . against a table on which her folded arms were resting , and her head was hidden within them . it was an attitude of hopelessness . and would have served to strike job dumb in sickness of heart . even without the sound of mrs. [female] 's voice in passionate sobbing .
his arms were folded now across his broad brown flannel chest . and the pistols gleamed in his belt below like fine ornaments . he wore a philosophical expression , and looked at his companion as if she were a new specimen of the human kind . and he was studying her variety , quite impersonally , it is true , but interestedly . there was something in his look that angered the girl .
and yet to you , my friend , it probably will not seem that she was so beautiful . since i have , alas , only the words we all use to paint commoner . coarser things , and no means to represent all the exquisite details . all the delicate lights , and shades , and swift changes of colour and expression . moreover , is it not a fact that the strange or unheard of can never appear beautiful in a mere description .
[male] had long since given up trying to discourage him ; she even accepted attentions from him now that she had used to refuse . he always walked home with her from evening meetings and was her partner in the games at quilting parties . it was great fun for the young folks . `` old jerome and [female] '' were a standing joke in deep meadows . but the older people had ceased to expect anything to come of it .
at last she reached the ha ha hedge in front of the gate . she broke her nails against the lock in her haste to open it . then a hundred steps farther on , breathless , almost falling , she stopped . and now turning round , she once more saw the impassive chateau . with the park , the gardens , the three courts .
this said , i went up stairs , and joined my [female] in the darkened room . she was sitting alone in the dim light . with the bandage over her eyes , with her pretty hands crossed patiently on her lap . my heart swelled in me as i looked at her . and felt the horrid discovery that i had made still present in my mind .
she knew exactly how far it was to the inn that [female] had named as her lodging . it would occupy about seven minutes to get there at an ordinary walking pace . seven to come back again , if he did not return in fourteen minutes he would have lingered . she looked at the clock , it was twenty five minutes to eleven . he might enter the inn with [female] .
for these reasons mr [male] passed but anxious hours until evening came . and with it mr [male] , stumping leisurely to the roman empire . at about this period mr [male] had become profoundly interested in the fortunes of a great military leader known to him as bully sawyers . but perhaps better known to fame and easier of identification by the classical student , under the less britannic name of [male] . even this general 's career paled in interest for mr [male] before the clearing of his conscience with [male] .
the group forming a picture of honest beauty flanked by innocence . and backed by simple souled vanity , they followed the way till they reached the beginning of the ascent . on the crest of which the vehicle from trantridge was to receive her . this limit having been fixed to save the horse the labour of the last slope . far away behind the first hills the cliff like dwellings of [location] broke the line of the ridge .
such were pretty much the position and policy of england . out of our crop of constitutionalism we speculated on a rich harvest . to be afterwards manufactured for our use and benefit . we leave it to deeper heads to say if the result has been all that we calculated on . and , asking pardon for such digression , we join sir [male] once more .
[female] , feeling faint and sick . went to the wellbox and peered over , the bucket sat on the shelf inside . far down below was a tiny glimmer of still water , the cuthbert well was the deepest in avonlea , if dora . but [female] could not face the idea , she shuddered and turned away . `` run across for mr. [male] , '' said marilla .
mrs. hope consented , and clover walked home as if treading on air . was this thehelen 's to which she had looked forward with so much dread . this gay , delightful place , where such [female] things happened . and people were so kind ? how she wished that she could get at [female] and papa for five minutes . on a wishing carpet or something .
she would creep up to the house and listen for the sound of a child 's voice . if she heard it , and the voice was that of a child that was well . she would be content , she would go away , and if she did not hear it . if the child was gone , if there was no longer any child there , if it was in heaven . she would go away just the same -- only god knew how , god knew where .
a bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the doctor with himself . at the moment when the doctor was wiping marius face , and lightly touching his still closed eyes with his finger . a door opened at the end of the drawing room . and a long , pallid figure made its appearance , the revolt had .
`` dear lad , '' said [male] , pressing his hand , `` you '' are in a friend 's hands that loved your father . and loves you for his sake , rest ye a little quietly . for ye are somewhat out of case , then shall ye tell me your story . and betwixt the two of [male] we shall find a remedy for all .
cottager , who knows whether he was the father of [female] 's child ? she never said he was , wife . nobody but him . that i am sure -- i would lay a wager -- no , no husband . you must not take his part -- it was very wicked ! who knows what is now become of that poor creature ? she has not been heard of this many a year .
how long the light had been darting about the room like a very much enlarged firefly . jimmy did not know , it seemed to him like hours . for it had woven itself into an incoherent waking dream of his . and for a moment , as the mists of sleep passed away from his brain . he fancied that he was dreaming still , then , sleep left him .
at a large house in grosvenor square they stopt . mrs [female] turned exultingly to the stranger . but her glance met no gratification , the young woman . instead of admiring the house , and counting the number of steps that led to the vestibule . or of windows that commanded a view of the square .
she did not rouse up to much interest , but looked at it as if trying to recollect where she could have seen its like . [female] did not say anything but that it was very pretty . in a low voice , and then she quickly left the shop . much to coulson 's displeasure , [female] rose . sitting helpless in her chair , watched her with keen eyes .
and then he bethought himself that if they could both be slaughtered in such an encounter it would be the only fitting termination to the present state of things . in that way , too , there would be an escape from [male] . and , at the present moment , he saw none other . when he entered the room he shook hands with all the party from allington . but , as he told his sister afterwards .
i wished i had learned it if it had any meaning . i wondered if miss [female] understood it . at any rate , i fancied i could arrange flowers to the taste of any lady whose face i had ever seen . and for [female] i would make something so superb that her face could not help lighting up when she beheld it . i imagined just how her bluish gray eyes would brighten , her cheeks would redden .
so after the disgrace of his father , [male] did a great deal of thinking and planning which he kept carefully to himself . he considered in turn the different occupations to which he could turn his hand . and negatived them one by one , few business firms would care to employ the son of as shrewd an embezzler as [male] . finally he came to a decision , he communicated this decision to his sister . it would have commended itself more logically to her had she been able to follow step by step the considerations that had led her brother to it .
from less to more , i worked him up to considerable irritation ; then , after he had retired . in dudgeon , quite to the other end of the room . i got up , and saying , `` i wish you good night , sir , '' in my natural and wonted respectful manner , i slipped out by the side door and got away . the system thus entered on , i pursued during the whole season of probation .
captain [female] breakfasted with her . and took her to the station , and saw her off with all possible courtesy and attention . and then he walked back by himself to his own great house in perivale . not a word more had been said between him and [male] as to their engagement . and he recognised it as a fact that he was no longer bound to her as her future husband .
`` drink , '' he said , `` my children '' they were the first words he had spoken -- the gifts of god are to be enjoyed , when the giver is remembered . having said this , he retired to the outward cell . probably for performance of his devotions , and left his guests together in the inner apartment .
little by little clarissa came to accept those visits of mr. [male] 's as a common part of her daily life . but she had not the faintest notion that she was drifting into a position from which it would be difficult by and by to escape . he paid her no disagreeable attentions . he never alluded to that unfortunate declaration which she remembered with such a sense of its absurdity . it did not seem unreasonable to suppose that he came to mill cottage for no keener delight than a quiet chat with mr. [female] about the possibility of a coming war .
if jo had not been otherwise engaged , laurie 's behavior would have amused her . for a faint twinge , not of jealousy . but something like suspicion , caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first . and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection , but it did not last long . he got interested in spite of himself .
it was different from the former silent breathless hush . i do not know if it were from this cause , or from the recollection of peril past . or that he looked below , in the breathing moment before returning with the remaining person slung across his shoulders . but [male] step was less steady , his tread more uncertain . he seemed to feel with his foot for the next round of the ladder .
there was a difference , and yet there was a parallel , then as now he had been a comedian . and the part that he had played then was , when you came to think of it . akin to the part he was to play this evening . for what had he been at rennes but a sort of scaramouche . the little skirmisher , the astute intriguer , spattering the seed of trouble with a sly hand ?
meanwhile [female] worked upon a farm labourer . a neighbour of his , an honest man ( if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor ) . but with very little wit in his pate , in a word . he so talked him over , and with such persuasions and promises . that the poor clown made up his mind to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire .
stephen could not have told why , for he was not thinking of margot . but suddenly he was convinced that a telegram from her was on the way . fixing the exact date when she might be expected in england . she spent hours on the roof . with saidee or alone , looking out over the desert , through the field glasses which maïeddine had sent to her .
the day was glorious , on the far shore he saw life where last night 's camp had been . men were moving about close to the water , and a york boat was putting out slowly into the stream . close under the window moved a canoe with a single occupant . it was andre , the broken man , with powerful strokes he was paddling across the river . his deformity was scarcely noticeable in the canoe , his bare head and [male] beard shone in the sun .
meanwhile , within her , pauperism , the proletariat . salary , education , penal servitude , prostitution , the fate of the woman . wealth , misery , production , consumption . division , exchange , coin , credit . the rights of capital , the rights of labor .
that is generally the plea piteous with a lie , or it may be as follows . `` it is only fair to say that i do not quite know when i can pay it back . '' this is the plea piteous with a truth , and upon the whole i think that this is generally the most successful mode of borrowing . and there is the assured demand , -- which betokens a close intimacy , old fellow . can you let me have thirty pounds , no ?
consenting to this with a laugh , lady ongar made her way up to the downs . and walked steadily on toward the extreme point of the island , to the needles themselves she did not make her way . these rocks are now approached , as all the stay at home travellers know , through a fort . and down to the fort she did not go , but turning a little from the highest point of the hill toward the cliffs on her left hand . she descended till she reached a spot from which she could look down on the pebbly beach lying some three hundred feet below her .
the room when they went in was full of mournful solemnity . on the work table , covered over with a white cloth , there were five or six small balls of cotton in a silver dish . near a large crucifix between two lighted candles , emma , her chin sunken upon her breast . had her eyes inordinately wide open , and her poor hands wandered over the sheets with that hideous and soft movement of the dying . that seems as if they wanted already to cover themselves with the shroud .
a man of business had a small property in trust for me . i was to be a governess ; i became a governess . and went into the family of a poor nobleman , where there were two daughters . little children , but the parents wished them to grow up . if possible , under one instructress , the mother was young and pretty , from the first .
that last , in truth , was her valid excuse for not having told him the whole story . she had hardly been with him long enough to do more than accept the offer he had himself made . of course she would have told him of mr maguire . of mr maguire and of mr [male] also . when first an opportunity might come for her to do so , she had no desire to keep from his knowledge any tittle of what had occurred .
but this was not all , years ago there had been in his mother 's mind a great fancy about thomasin and himself . it had not positively amounted to a desire , but it had always been a favourite dream . that they should be man and wife in good time . if the happiness of neither were endangered thereby , was the fancy in question . so that what course save one was there now left for any son who reverenced his mother 's memory as yeobright did ?
the sun , approaching the zenith , shone almost perpendicularly upon the plateau of the douvres . a flood of light descended from the heavens . the vast reflection from the glassy sea increased its splendour . the rock itself imbibed the rays and warmed the sleeper . the sun continued its gentle offices , the wind .
this was very perplexing , and i knew not what course to take , i told my governess the story of the boatswain . and she was mighty eager with me treat with him . but i had no mind to it , till i heard whether my husband . or fellow prisoner , so she called him . could be at liberty to go with me or no , at last i was forced to let her into the whole matter .
i am not more or less than human , and i remembered with joy that once i had thrashed him soundly at the prep school for bullying a smaller boy . but our score from school days was not without tallies on his side . he was easily the better scholar—i grant him that . and he was shrewd and plausible , you never quite knew the extent of his powers and resources . and he had , i always maintained , the most amazing good luck , —as witness the fact that [male] had taken a friendly interest in him .
his chief disadvantage lay in athletics . but as soon as he discovered that it was the touchstone of power and popularity at school . he began to make furious , persistent efforts to excel in the winter sports . and with his ankles aching and bending in spite of his efforts . he skated valiantly around the lorelie rink every afternoon .
he bowed and as they disappeared from the great hall the hubbub of voices became tumultuous . approaching the place by the small door connecting it with the hall way in which i stood . i took a hurried look within , and , seeing no one , stepped boldly down between the palms to the little nook where lovers of this quiet spot were accustomed to sit . it was empty , and so was the library beyond , coming back , i accosted [male] . whom i found superintending the removal of the potted plants which encumbered the passages .
who , if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance . would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation . i could not unlove him , because i felt sure he would soon marry this very lady . because i read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her -- because i witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which . if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek , was yet , in its very carelessness .
the indian converts disappearing , driven back to their original wildernesses , the last traces of the noble work of his order being rapidly swept away . his courage faltered , his faith died out , changes in the manners and customs of his order itself . also , were giving him deep pain , he was a franciscan of the same type as [male] of assisi . to wear a shoe in place of a sandal . to take money in a purse for a journey .
the first snow had smothered it in a loneliness that was almost the loneliness of desertion . with that first snow began the harvest days of the people of the wilderness . far and wide they were busy along their trap lines , their lonely shacks hidden in the shelter of thick swamps . in deep chasms and dense forests . for six months the short days and the long nights had been days and nights of fur gathering .
meeting them abruptly at last in the full glare of the office . he clutched fatuously at mr. [male] 's reluctant attention with some quick question about the extraordinary moonlight . and stood by , grinning like any bashful schoolboy , while mr. [male] explained to him severely . as if it were his fault , just why and to what extent the radii of mountain moonlight differed from the radii of any other kind of moonlight . and eve herself , in absolute spiritual remoteness , stood patiently shifting her weight from one foot to the other .
what -- is it liza lu ? asked tess , in startled accents . her sister , whom a little over a year ago she had left at home as a child . had sprung up by a sudden shoot to a form of this presentation . of which as yet [female] seemed herself scarce able to understand the meaning . her thin legs , visible below her once long frock , now short by her growing .
the gates , or doors , of iron were thrown wide open . and the little procession entered a huge open court , on one side was accommodation for many animals . as in a caravanserai , with a narrow roof sheltering thirty or forty stalls . and here the two white meharis were made to kneel , that the women might descend from their bassourahs . there were three , all veiled , but the arms of one were bare and very brown .
her attention spread a tranquil surface to the demonstrations of others . and it was only in days of storm that one felt the pressure of the tides . this inscrutable composure was perhaps her chief [female] in glennard 's eyes . reserve , in some natures , implies merely the locking of empty rooms or the dissimulation of awkward encumbrances . but miss trent 's reticence was to glennard like the closed door to the sanctuary .
nor were the drafts made in secret , to every gentleman , from the outset . she proclaimed the relation in which she would stand to him . moreover , always she needed a strong filial sense in return . this was only fair , because the duke was an orphan , even more than because he was a duke . her heart had with a special rush gone out to him when he and mr. [male] became her tenants .
from the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes . drawing himself up obsequiously , and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals . bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements , and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief . it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander . thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment .
you are lord brentford 's member . are you not ? asked madame max goesler . this was a question which [male] did not quite like , and which he was obliged to excuse by remembering that the questioner had lived so long out of england as to be probably ignorant of the myths . and theories , and system , and working of the british constitution . violet effingham , little as she knew of politics .
here i sat for hours , i suppose ; till , returning somewhat to myself . i saw that the red light had paled away , and felt a cool gentle breath gliding over my forehead . i rose and left the hall with unsteady steps . finding my way with some difficulty to my own chamber . and faintly remembering , as i went , that only in the marble cave , before i found the sleeping statue .
the level rays of the low afternoon sun entered directly at the window . and as [male] seated himself in his velvet chair with their [male] warmth upon him . he was conscious of that quiet well being which perhaps you and i have felt on a sunny afternoon when . in our brightest youth and health , life has opened a new vista for us . and long tomorrows of activity have stretched before [male] like a lovely plain which there was no need for hurrying to look at .
i acted upon the suggestion , and led the way to the woods . i had not had occasion to seek a hickory sapling before for years . not since the war , in fact , when i learned how hot a fire small hickory sticks would make . i had not sought wood for whistles since -- gracious , nearly a quarter of a century ago ! the dissimilar associations called up by these recollections threatened to put me in a frame of mind which might have resulted in a bad poem .
this man whom she loved with her whole soul was to be married in a few days . the world of society would be at the wedding . he was pledged to another , and he was not hers . yet he was her old friend . and was coming to see her , if he came and looked into her face with those clear eyes of his .
it was only then that captain [female] turned , looked at the place they had vacated and resumed his tramping . but not his desultory conversation with his second officer . his nervous exasperation had grown so much that now very often he used to lose control of his voice . if he did not watch himself it would suddenly die in his throat . he had to make sure before he ventured on the simplest saying .
passing through the dining room , a room not very large . with dark , paneled walls , stepan arkadyevitch and levin walked over the soft carpet to the half dark study . lighted up by a single lamp with a big dark shade . another lamp with a reflector was hanging on the wall . lighting up a big full length portrait of a woman , which levin could not help looking at .
the very young man was glad to do as he was told , and sat beside aura in the garden . while the big business man brought up to their size the remainder of the supplies . when they had divided the food , and all were equipped for the journey . they started at once for the tunnels , lylda 's eyes again filled with tears as she left so summarily . and probably for the last time , this home in which she had been so happy .
for answer , i smote him on the cheek . lightly , and not to hurt him : but to make his blood leap up . i would not sully my tongue by speaking to a man like this . i think that he felt that his time was come . i think he knew from my knitted muscles , and the firm arch of my breast .
it was fine , warm october weather as he turned his back upon the coast . and set off on his walk northwards , green leaves were yet upon the trees . the hedges were one flush of foliage and the wild rough flavoured fruits of different kinds . the fields were tawny with the uncleared off stubble , or emerald green with the growth of the aftermath . the roadside cottage gardens were gay with hollyhocks and [male] daisies and marigolds .
i go up to [location] in february , i suppose i may hardly hope to see you before the recess in july or august . but i trust that before that we shall have fixed the day when you will make me the happiest of men . it may be imagined that captain [male] . who knew the comforts of his club and was accustomed to life in [location] . would feel the dulness of the paternal roof to be almost unendurable , in truth .
`` i do want him to think i look well , and tell them so at home , '' said [female] to herself , as she put on [organization] 's old white silk ball dress . and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion . out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect . her hair she had the sense to let alone .
when the two women were alone together , [female] , of course . scolded her friend for having written to norfolk without letting it be known that she was doing so . scolded her , and declared how vain it was for her to make useless efforts for an unattainable end . but mrs. [female] always managed to slip out of these reproaches , neither asserting herself to be right . nor owning herself to be wrong , but you must answer his letter , ', she said .
at the other end , they descended a few steps . the passage grew narrower ; the wall upon one hand was now of wood . the noise of people talking , and a faint flickering of lights . came through the interstices ; and presently they came to a round hole about the size of a man 's eye . and [male] , looking down through it , beheld the interior of the hall .
`` is he [male] irving 's son ? '' miss lavendar asked , bending over her namesake border so that her face was hidden . she opened the gate under the firs for them to pass through . she looked suddenly old and tired ; the glow and radiance had faded from her face . her parting smile was as sweet with ineradicable youth as ever , but when the girls looked back from the first curve in the lane they saw her sitting on the old stone bench under the silver poplar in the middle of the garden with her head leaning wearily on her hand .
what [male] lacked of his brother 's keen intelligence he made up for in cunning . he realized that although at some future time it was possible that helston and truro and the [male] property there might come to suffer as a consequence of the development of a port so much more advantageously situated . yet that could not be in his own lifetime ; and meanwhile he must earn in return sir [male] 's support for his suit of [male] and thus find the [male] estates merged with his own . this certain immediate gain was to master [male] well worth the other future possible loss . it must not , however , be supposed that [male] 's courtship had thenceforward run a smooth and easy course .
there happened that year to be an unusual proportion of girls and women in the advanced laboratory . perhaps because the class as a whole was an exceptionally small one , it numbered nine . and four of these were women students , as a consequence of its small size . it was possible to get along with the work on a much easier and more colloquial footing than a larger class would have permitted . and a custom had grown up of a general tea at four o'clock .
he carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in england the ambassadors of denmark . who had taken their leave , and the regular ambassador of [male] . who was to take back to the port of flushing the indian merchantmen of which [male] had made restitution to the united provinces . but as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the event . that is to say , till two o'clock in the afternoon -- two vessels had already left the port .
he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated . which imprison even the eye , and which are equivalent to four walls , there are meditations which may be called vertical . when one is at the bottom of them , time is required to return to earth . [male] had plunged into one of these reveries , he was thinking of [male] . of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her .
after that carrigan waited , tense with the desire for action to begin . he sensed no premonition of evil about to befall him . every nerve and sinew in his body was alive for the combat . he thrilled with an overwhelming confidence , a conviction of his ability to win . an almost dangerous , self conviction of approaching triumph in spite of the odds in weight and brute strength which were pitted against him .
nor was [female] less so , for what with blows and bruises he could not sit upright on the ass . and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven . so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him . and it could have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to match his own adventures . for now , forgetting [male] , he bethought himself of the moor abindarraez .
what we said on that long drive would not interest the reader . i have learned by experience to skip all love talks in novels . no matter how delightful the lovers may be , recalling now our conversation . it does not seem to me to have had anything wonderful it in . i will only say that if i had been happy on the evening before .
never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs . i had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark . and in bringing him back ; and i looked about me now , difficult as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched . when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard . i could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements .
when [female] heard [female] praised by all around her . it could not be but that she should praise him too . not out loud , as others did , but in the silence of her heart . and then his constancy to her had been so perfect , if that other one had never come ! if it could be that she might begin again , and that she might be spared that episode in her life which had brought him and her together !
he was powerfully built , rather over middle height , and about the age of thirty . his complexion was dark , and the hand that held the bow looked grimy . he bore himself well , but a little stiffly . with a care over his violin like that of a man carrying a baby . he was decidedly handsome , in a rugged way -- mouth and chin but hinted through a thick beard of darkest brown .
quasimodo who did not hear , saw the naked swords , the torches . the irons of the pikes , all that cavalry . at the head of which he recognized captain [male] . he beheld the confusion of the outcasts . the terror of some , the disturbance among the bravest of them .
he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart . if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment . dantes might have waited until the evening visit was over , but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind . and order the dead body to be removed earlier , in that case his last hope would have been destroyed . now his plans were fully made , and this is what he intended to do .
mr. [male] was perplexed in his mind when he reflected how much he might possibly be made to owe her if she should decide on appealing to a jury of her countrymen for justice . but anything would be better than his home atpeter's cum pumpkin with [male] sitting opposite to him as his wife . were there not distant lands in which a clergyman , unfortunate but still energetic . might find work to do ? was there not all [male] ? -- and were there not [location] . [location] , natal , all open to him ? would not a missionary career among the chinese be better for him thanpeter's cum pumpkin with [male] french for his wife ?
no higher the roofs of the very towers , up from their tiny segment of the earth 's spinning surface they stood negligible beneath infinity . and new , too , quite new , in eternity ; transient upstarts , i saw oxford as a place that had no more past and no more future than a mining camp . i smiled down , o hoary and unassailable mushroom , ... but if a man carry his sense of proportion far enough , lo ! he is back at the point from which he started . he knows that eternity , as conceived by him .
d'artagnan remained for a moment motionless . asking himself where he could be ; but soon a [male] of light which penetrated through the chamber . together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture . the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined . and the word `` majesty '' several times repeated , indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen 's apartment .
here was a man as careless as wyant of the minor forms . yet her appreciation of him was not affected by the lack of adaptability that she accused herself of criticizing in her suitor . she began to see that it was not the sense of wyant 's social deficiencies that had held her back . and the discovery at once set free her judgment of him . enabling her to penetrate to the real causes of her reluctance , she understood now that the flaw she felt was far deeper than any defect of manner .
her face was oval , marked in every cameo like line and feature with that expression of absolute . flawless purity , found in the angels and madonnas of old paintings . a purity that held in it no faintest strain of earthliness . her head was bare , and her thick . jet black hair was parted above her forehead and hung in two heavy lustrous braids over her shoulders .
there was another thing ; it was christmas eve . or rather christmas day , the day of [male] 's answer . if any succour was to be given at all , it must be given at once . before the fortress had capitulated , once let the engagement be renewed , and even if the money should subsequently be forthcoming . the difficulties would be doubled , but he was building his hopes upon sand .
at one end of the chamber , upon massive golden thrones encrusted with diamonds . sat than kosis and his consort , surrounded by officers and dignitaries of state . before them stretched a broad aisle lined on either side with soldiery . and as i looked there entered this aisle at the far end of the hall . the head of a procession which advanced to the foot of the throne .
seeing [female] tour in tears . she threw herself upon her neck . and pressing her in her arms , -- my dear friend , cried she . `` my dear friend , '' -- but her emotion choked her utterance . at this sight [location] burst into tears .
thus matters stood when tuesday arrived and the overdene party broke up . [male] went to town to spend a couple of days with the brands . [male] went straight to shenstone , where he had been asked expressly to meet miss [female] and her aunt . mrs. [female] bangs . [female] was due at shenstone on friday for the week-end .
so the evening passed , and thryng retired early to the bed in the loom shed . he knew something serious was amiss , but of what nature he could not conjecture . unless it were that frale had been making illicit whiskey . whatever it was , he chose to manifest no curiosity . in the morning he saw nothing of the young man .
at breakfast time , i evaded all further discussion of the subject , after i had first ascertained that lucilla did not expect her visitor before the afternoon . for some time after breakfast , i kept her at the piano . when she wearied of music , and began to talk of oscar once more . i put on my hat , and set forth on a domestic errand ( of the kind usually entrusted to zillah ) . solely for the purpose of keeping out of the way , and putting off to the last moment the hateful necessity of telling more lies .
but once i the union , his interests are taken care on better nor he could do it for himsel ' . or by himsel ' , for that matter , it 's the only way working men can get their rights . by all joining together , more the members , more chance for each one separate man having justice done him . government takes care o fools and madmen ; and if any man is inclined to do himsel
rose did not mind , she knew she did not mind , and , even worse . she knew she did not mind not minding , in this place she was indifferent to both the things that had filled her life and made it seem as if it were happy for years . well , if only she could rejoice in her wonderful new surroundings , have that much at least to set against the indifference . the letting go -- but she could not , she had no work . she did not pray ; she was left empty .
now , for once , i did hold off and did not write to you . because there was something in your last i could not give any answer to . and i hoped you would come yourself before i need . then i hoped silence would bring you : and now -- no , -- instead of your dear peace giving face i get this complaint ! ah , beloved , have you in reality any complaint .
at that time it was customary to carry convicts down to the dock yards by stage coach . as i had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers . and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof . i had no cause to be surprised when [male] . meeting me in the yard , came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me .
the first chill wind that blew upon the infant project came in the form of a rumor that the international packing company . one of the big constituent members of the packing house combination at [organization] and thirty ninth streets . had determined to desert the old group and lay out a new packing area for itself . the papers explained that the company intended to go farther south , probably below fifty fifth street and west of ashland avenue . this was the territory that was located due west of [male] 's property .
seeing the group of us , the good carrier and his lads leapt down and rushed on my assailants . one of the thieves , they said , was for fighting it out . i could guess who that was -- and called on the rest to stand ; but they . more prudent , laid hands on him , and , in spite of his oaths . hustled him off along the road towards the station .
he was a reserved man , with a broad , overhanging , watchful head . that particular kind of dull red colour in his cheeks which is rather stale than fresh . and a somewhat uneasy expression about his coat cuffs , as if they were in his confidence . and had reasons for being anxious to hide his hands , in the little he said . he was a [male] man enough .
to say that i found life dull . even in skernford , at that time would be untrue , miss [female] was a furious partisan of the french . and i dared not mention the war to her , but i took in the `` daily news '' from my private funds , and read it in my bedroom every night with dimmed eyes . fast coming breath , and beating heart , i knew -- knew well , that [male] must be fighting .
immediately before her was the large , smooth millpond , over full , and intruding into the hedge and into the road . the water , with its flowing leaves and spots of froth . was stealing away , like time , under the dark arch , to tumble over the great slimy wheel within . on the other side of the mill pond was an open place called the cross . because it was three quarters of one , two lanes and a cattle drive meeting there .
up before dawn , the night watchman called us . six of us -- and we made coffee in a chafing dish ( you never saw so many grounds ! ) and walked two miles to the top of one tree hill to see the sun rise . we had to scramble up the last slope , the sun almost beat us ! and perhaps you think we did not bring back appetites to breakfast , dear me .
blurred and blotted , faulty and feeble as the lines were , they brought a look of inexpressible comfort to beth 's face . for her one regret had been that she had done so little , and this seemed to assure her that her life had not been useless . that her death would not bring the despair she feared . as she sat with the paper folded between her hands . the charred log fell asunder , jo started up , revived the blaze .
the loom shed was one of the log cabins connected with the main building by a roofed passage . which thryng had noticed the evening before as being an odd fashion of house architecture . giving the appearance of a small flock of cabins all nestling under the wings of the old building in the centre . he had been too exhausted the previous evening to do more than fall into the bed which had been provided him and sleep his long , uninterrupted sleep . now he saw why they had called this part of the home the loom shed .
... later , that evening , [female] and [female] remembered the c'lection . so they came for it , a mistake . discovering the fragments upon the veranda , they made the much more important mistake of entering the house to demand an explanation . which they received immediately , it was delivered with so much vigour . indeed , that [female] was surprised and hurt , and yet , the most important of her dreamy wishes of the afternoon had been fulfilled .
the car of the apaches was upon him in a pulse beat . with no least warning of his intention , [male] morbihan had no time to employ brakes . lanyard saw its dark shape flash past the windows of his cab and heard a shout of triumph . then with all his might he flung the heavy cushion across that scant space . directly into the face of [male] morbihan .
so i am free , free , but for the cursed haste with which i hurried headlong into the bonds of matrimony with . heaven knows whom , as far as i remember , she should have been young . but even had not her face been concealed by her kerchief , i doubt whether . in my then plight , i should have taken much note of her , free , bah ! the tower bonds were but a thread of silk compared with these conjugal fetters which i .
the trench itself was the room . in which the lucky ones , such as the squadron commander . had a board , lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance . to serve as a table , on each side of the trench . the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet .
nevertheless , [female] did not reappear in the open air without profound anxiety . he discovered the house in the rue plumet . and hid himself from sight there , henceforth he was in the possession of the name , ultime fauchelevent . at the same time he hired two other apartments in [location] . in order that he might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the same quarter .
[male] 's honour , [male] 's happiness . [male] 's life itself . might depend on my quick ears and my faithful memory to night . i had heard the count say that he meant to examine the rooms on each side of the library . and the staircase as well , before he entered on any explanation with sir [male] .
but to return to [female] , it took johansen . insulting and reviling the poor wretch , fully ten minutes to get him started again . a little later he made the end of the gaff . where , astride the spar itself , he had a better chance for holding on . he cleared the sheet , and was free to return , slightly downhill now , along the halyards to the mast .
then , in her grief , the widow dame resolved that she would fly with her little son . and make a home for him in some wilderness . where never sounds or sights of war or death would come . where knights would be unknown , and no one would speak to him of arms and battles . and thus did she do , and she left the hall where she had lived .
`` promised ? '' the word sank into his heart like lead , `` promised ? '' slowly he released her hands . and she covered her face with them and sank at his feet . he bent down to her and asked almost in a whisper : `` promised ? did you say that word ? '' all the chivalry of his nature rose within him .
next day , when you were at [location] . waiting for your father , and he did not return , a man came to the door and handed in a letter from [male] duval . his letter , which i inclose with this , begged me , in the most serious terms . to keep you away on the following day , on some excuse or other . and to see your father , who wished to speak to me , and asked me particularly not to say anything to you about it .
the `` vulgarity '' [male] spoke of . referred purely to the use of local words , and the expression arose out of the conversation they had just been holding . but mr. [male] 's brow darkened ; and [female] suddenly felt how her speech might be misunderstood by him . so , in the natural sweet desire to avoid giving unnecessary pain , she forced herself to go forwards with a little greeting . and continue what she was saying , addressing herself to him expressly .
a sea which rolls into a gulf is always terrible , it is the same with a crowd of people . a multitude is a sort of fluid body . when the quantity which can enter is less than the quantity endeavouring to force a way . there is a fatal crush among the crowd , a fierce convulsion on the water . as long as the west wind blows .
[female] would have declined this distinction , but that the vivacity of her ardent new friend . precipitated her to the staircase , ere she was aware that she was the first to lead the way thither . gaily , then , he would have placed her in the seat of honour . as lady president of the evening ; but , more now upon her guard . she insisted upon standing till the visitors should be arranged , as she was herself a resident in the house .
you see , i recognized my mistake at once , i had set her works a going . it was my own fault ; she would be thirty days getting down to those facts . and she generally began without a preface and finished without a result . if you interrupted her she would either go right along without noticing . or answer with a couple of words .
such repression had been needed , and had been perhaps salutary , but it had not left behind it much affection . and then her nearest relatives were not sympathetic with the duke , he could obtain no assistance in the care of his girl from that source . nor could he even do it from his own cousins wives , who were his nearest connections on the side of the pallisers . they were women to whom he had ever been kind .
i meant to write to you before and thank you for your christmas cheque . but life in the [female] household is very absorbing . and i do not seem able to find two consecutive minutes to spend at a desk . i bought a new gown -- one that i did not need , but just wanted . my christmas present this year is from daddy long legs .
he had resolved that he would refrain from further love making till the winter . but he found it very hard to refrain when so addressed , to take her in his arms . and kiss her twenty times , and swear that he would never let her go . to claim her at once savagely as his own , that was the line of conduct to which temptation prompted him . how could she look at him so sweetly , how could she stand before him .
[male] , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . he bore it with noble indifference . and she would have imagined that [male] had received his sanction to be happy . had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr. [male] . with an expression of half laughing alarm , she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together .
i shall see you sometimes , she said , with timid hesitation , i shall see you sometimes , sha not i , when you come home from town ? not often , of course ; i dare say it is not right to come here often . away from [male] ; and the last time i kept him waiting for his dinner . but i told him where i had been , and that i would seen you .
some women like to collect men 's hearts and hide them away from other women on cold storage . and the helpless things can not help themselves , i have contempt for that sort of a woman . and i love [female] , it 's my duty to look the matter in the face before i look in [female] 's , and decide . if not [female] , what then ? first -- no husband , that 's out of the question ! i am not strong minded enough to crank my own motor car and study woman 's suffrage .
[female] had by this time perceived that she was not destined on this occasion to gain any great victory . she , however , was angry as well as the doctor , it was not the man 's vehemence that provoked her so much as his evident determination to break down the prestige of her rank . and place her on a footing in no respect superior to his own . he had never before been so audaciously arrogant ; and , as she moved towards the door . she determined in her wrath that she would never again have confidential intercourse with him in any relation of life whatsoever .
war is such a ghastly , hideous horror , and so utterly at variance with this simple narrative . that i hesitate to speak of it , there can be no moments of happiness . no rifts of [female] , and but few gleams of hope woven into the picture . all must be as war is -- a varying but continued succession of dreaded horror and the fear of death . the first month of manson 's experience at the training camp was hard only in anticipation .
so all day long the noise of battle rolled among the mountains by the winter sea . until king [male] 's table . man by man , had fallen in lyonnesse about their lord , king [male] . then , because his wound was deep , the bold sir [male] uplifted him . and bore him to a chapel nigh the field .
but at last , just before he went , these feelings and these convictions gave way to pity . and he remembered simply the troubles which seemed to have been heaped on the head of this poor victim to misfortune . as he drove home he resolved that there was nothing left for him to do . but to write to the dean , it was known to all who knew them both . that the dean and mr. [male] had lived together on the closest intimacy at college .
only those who have heard [female] sing the rosary can possibly realise how she sang `` i kiss each bead . '' the lingering retrospection in each word ; breathed out a love so womanly . so beautiful , so tender , that her identity was forgotten -- even by those in the audience who knew her best . in the magic of her rendering of the song . the accompaniment , which opens with a single chord , closes with a single note .
the vague feeling of uneasiness which had already attacked me grew stronger . although i fought against it , calling myself an old woman and a coward . i must confess to an impulse which almost made me beg the station master 's company on my walk . but , besides being ashamed to exhibit a timidity apparently groundless , i was reluctant to draw attention to myself in any way . i would not for the world have it supposed that i carried anything of value .
he recognised the mayor by his scarf . and explained to him that the prefect was not able to come , he himself was a councillor at the prefecture . then he added a few apologies , [male] tuvache answered them with compliments . the other confessed himself nervous ; and they remained thus , face to face . their foreheads almost touching , with the members of the jury all round .
anhalt , when two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state . matrimony may be called a happy life , when such a wedded pair find thorns in their path . each will be eager , for the sake of the other , to tear them from the root . where they have to [location] , or wind a labyrinth . the most experienced will lead the way , and be a guide to his companion .
no , she was not thinking most of the giver when she smiled at the ear rings . for now she is taking them out of the box . not to press them to her lips , but to fasten them in her ears . only for one moment , to see how pretty they look , as she peeps at them in the glass against the wall . with first one position of the head and then another , like a listening bird .
eating his last slices of bread and ham . and drinking from the bottle of cider he had taken the precaution to bring with him . he got into the lonely waggon , here he spread half of the hay as a bed . and , as well as he could in the darkness , pulled the other half over him by way of bed clothes . covering himself entirely , and feeling , physically , as comfortable as ever he had been in his life .
for many days my sufferings were excessive , so that i often wished myself back in that milder purgatory of the forest . from which i had been so anxious to escape , when i try to retrace my route on the map . there occurs a break here -- a space on the chart where names of rivers and mountains call up no image to my mind . although , in a few cases , they were names i seem to have heard in a troubled dream . the impressions of nature received during that sick period are blurred .
in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army [male] loses its rights . and the rights and the strength of [location] increase . the victories of the french at jena and auerstadt destroy the independent existence of [location] . after the french victory at borodino there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious . yet the french army ceased to exist , what does this mean ? if it were an example taken from the history of [location] .
alessandro was much heavier , and many inches taller , still , could any man carry such a burden safely on that narrow beam ! ramona looked away , and shut her eyes , through the silence which followed . it was only a few moments ; but it seemed an eternity before a glad murmur of voices told her that it was done . and looking up , she saw felipe lying on the roof , unconscious , his face white . his eyes shut , at this sight .
clarissa thanked the man , and surprised him with half a crown gently slipped into his fat palm . she had not many half crowns now ; but the [female] seemed to pity her . and might influence his master to come to her a little sooner than he would come in the ordinary way . her errand being done , she turned away from the house with a strange sinking at the heart . an ever present fear of his illness coming to a fatal end .
they passed upstairs , kissed , and amidst the endless iterations fell asleep . the house had enshadowed the tree at first , but as the moon rose higher the two disentangled . and were clear for a few moments at midnight , [female] and looked into the garden . how incomprehensible that leonard bast should have won her this night of [male] ! was he also part of mrs. [female] 's mind ?
the future , coloured by what mrs. [female] had said to him . took on such a [male] glow it almost hurt his mental eyes . he revelled in greater freedom from care than he ever had known . he sat straighter , and curiously watched the people in the car . when they entered the city and the car swung down his street near the business centre .
what they let slip , what they forget in the movement and changes of free life . you hold on to , amplify , exaggerate into a rank growth of memories . they can look with a smile at the troubles and pains of the past . but you can not , old pains keep on gnawing at your heart . old desires , old deceptions , old dreams .
fancy made a motion of accepting the correction . but her partner took no notice , and proceeded with the next movement . with an affectionate bend towards her , `` that shiner 's too fond of her , '' the young man said to himself as he watched them . they came to the top again , fancy smiling warmly towards her partner .
if you write me letters . please let them be natural ones , your last , that dissertation on architecture . was perfectly awful -- so `` highbrow '' that i picture you living in an intellectual and emotional vacuum . and beware of trying to classify people too definitely into types . you will find that all through their youth they will persist annoyingly in jumping from class to class .
against a rock , on a hard bed of stone . lay the unconscious figure of marguerite blakeney , while some few paces further on . the unfortunate jew was receiving on his broad back the blows of two stout leather belts . wielded by the stolid arms of two sturdy soldiers of the republic . the howls of benjamin rosenbaum were fit to make the dead rise from their graves .
why certain clothes or foods are prescribed in [location] or [location] for sundays and fridays . while certain others , just equally warm or digestible or the contrary , are perfectly lawful to all the world alike on tuesdays and saturdays . these were the curious questions he had come so far to investigate , for which the fakirs and dervishes of every land gave such fanciful reasons . and he saw he would have no difficulty in picking up abundant examples of his subject matter everywhere in england . as the metropolis of taboo , it exhibited the phenomena in their highest evolution .
after these neophytes came a guard of warders on foot . in the same sable livery , amidst whose partisans might be seen the pale form of the accused . moving with a slow but undismayed step towards the scene of her fate . she was stript of all her ornaments . lest perchance there should be among them some of those amulets which [male] was supposed to bestow upon his victims .
to my dear mother , who had partly outlived the exceeding value of trifles . the most important matter seemed to ensure [female] countenance and presence at the marriage . and if i succeeded in this , i might well forget all the maidens ', trumpery . this she would have been wiser to tell me when they were out of hearing . for i left her to fight her own battle with them .
this day had gone by like so many more , in an activity that was like a trance . at the end there was a little haste , to finish what was in hand . she was pressing the children with questions . so that they should know all they were to know , by the time the gong went . she stood in shadow in front of the class .
it was very vexatious , and she was heartily sorry for it . but so it was ; and so far from now meaning to marry the elder . she did not even want to attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty required . his lengthened absence from mansfield , without anything but pleasure in view . and his own will to consult , made it perfectly clear that he did not care about her .
`` take off your cap ... your caps , '' these words went from one to another in the crowd . the interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it was far to the [organization] . the porter , listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking russian . did not understand what was being said to him and slipped behind the others , murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the russian army was . one of the russians understood what was asked and several voices at once began answering the interpreter .
this bold surmise , however , she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact . the anxious affection , which she was accused of having continually watched in [female] 's every look and action . had , in the course of their yesterday 's party . received the delightful confession of an equal love , her heart and faith were alike engaged to [female] . never had [female] listened to anything so full of interest .
he returned to adare like one in a dream -- a dream that was grief and pain . with its one golden thread of joy , [female] was there now . and the indian woman ; and the master of adare had the still little babe huddled up against his breast . it was some time before they could induce him to give it to moanne . then , suddenly , he shook himself like a great bear .
and there was another quarrel taking place in [male] . on the score of that election , between persons with whom we are connected in this story . mr. [male] had a vote in the borough . and was disposed to make use of it ; and mrs. prime , regarding her own position as mr. [female] 's affianced bride . considered herself at liberty to question mr. [male] as to the use which he proposed to make of that vote .
mrs jo laughed ; but she was in earnest . for by various hints and signs during the past winter she knew that the boys were beginning to `` see life '' in the way she especially disapproved , both were far from home . had money enough to waste , and were as inexperienced , curious , and credulous as most lads of their age . not fond of books , therefore without the safeguard which keeps many studious fellows out of harm .
but like a destructive pestilence have laid waste and destroyed every thing that before was fair and flourishing . on this occasion no man 's service is compelled . but you are invited voluntarily to come forward in defence of everything that is dear to you . by entering your names on the lists which are sent to the tything man of every parish . and engaging to act either as associated volunteers bearing arms , as pioneers and labourers .
mr. [male] kept up the conversation with much liveliness . introducing as subjects always in taste ( the jew is proud of his loyalty ) . the queen and the royal family , the emperor and empress of the french . into which both grandmother and wife entered with zest . mrs. [female] the younger showed an accurate memory of distinguished birthdays .
the clouds were drifting far away , the western sky was clear with the sun still above the hills . in an old tree that leaned far out over the valley , a crow shook the wet from his plumage and dried himself in the warm light . while far below the mists rolled , and on the surface of that gray sea . the traveler saw a company of buzzards . wheeling and circling above some dead thing hidden in its depth .
it had gradually become rumoured in the village that the body to be brought and buried that day was all that was left of the unfortunate [female] robin who had followed the eleventh from casterbridge through melchester and onwards . but , thanks to boldwood 's reticence and oak 's generosity . the lover she had followed had never been individualized as troy . [female] hoped that the whole truth of the matter might not be published till at any rate the girl had been in her grave for a few days . when the interposing barriers of earth and time .
she was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything levin disliked . she quite understood how right the levins were in not wishing to have anything to do with vronsky . but she felt she must go and see [female] . and show her that her feelings could not be changed , in spite of the change in her position . that she might be independent of the levins in this expedition .
she seemed to catch at these words -- that he remembered . too , long afterwards -- and said , more brightly , yes , mr [male] . yes , you may , the crazy staircase , usually not slow to give notice when any one was coming up or down . here creaked under a quick tread , and a further sound was heard upon it . as if a little steam engine with more steam than it knew what to do with .
at nine in the morning i started from the lodge . i was bound to ride to hofbau and there wait for a train which would carry me to the capital . from hofbau i could send a message . but the message must announce only my own coming , not the news i carried . to sapt , thanks to the cipher , i could send word at any time .
what wife ever ceased to respect her husband because he dealt dishonestly in business ? whereas , let him not go to church , let him drink too much wine . let him go astray in his conversation . and her wrath arises against these faults . but this lack of feminine accuracy in the matter of honesty tends rather to charity in their judgment of others .
but with gazebee he had nothing in common . and he felt that gazebee , who had once treated him with great deference . had now lost all such feeling , crosbie had once been a man of fashion in the estimation of the attorney . but that was all over , crosbie , in the attorney 's estimation . was now simply the secretary of a public office , -- a man who owed him money .
i shall desire and i shall find the best of my desires ; the autumn road . the mellow wind that soothes the darkening shires . and laughter , and inn fires , white mist about the [male] hedgerows . the slumbering midland plain . the silence where the clover grows , and the dead leaves in the lane .
never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully . [male] tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half past six , he then said . it is time to start ; the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o'clock . but perhaps [male] will not wait for that , consequently , [male] , having left the rue meslay at half past eight by his timepiece . entered the clover field while the clock of saint phillippe [male] roule was striking eight .
accordingly it became absolutely necessary for a cowboy to understand his gun and know how to place its contents where it would do the most good . therefore i in common with my other companions never lost an opportunity to practice with my 45 colts and the opportunities were not lacking by any means and so in time i became fairly proficient and able in most cases to hit a barn door providing the door was not too far away . and was steadily improving in this as i was in experience and knowledge of the other branches of the business which i had chosen as my life 's work and which i had begun to like so well . because while the life was hard and in some ways exacting , yet it was free and wild and contained the elements of danger which my nature craved and which began to manifest itself when i was a pugnacious youngster on the old plantation in our rock battles and the breaking of the wild horses . i gloried in the danger , and the wild and free life of the plains .
in a few moments she saw the white man counting out money into alessandro 's hand . then he turned and walked away , alessandro still standing as if rooted to the spot . gazing into the palm of his hand , benito and baba slowly walking away from him unnoticed . at last he seemed to rouse himself as from a trance . and picking up the horses reins , came slowly toward her , again she started to meet him .
for a long time pelet bore with my frigid demeanour very patiently . he even increased his attentions ; but finding that even a cringing politeness failed to thaw or move me . he at last altered too ; in his turn he cooled . his invitations ceased ; his countenance became suspicious and overcast , and i read in the perplexed yet brooding aspect of his brow . a constant examination and comparison of premises .
he had just reached the time of life at which `` young '' is ceasing to be the prefix of `` man '' in speaking of one . he was at the brightest period of masculine growth . for his intellect and his emotions were clearly separated : he had passed the time during which the influence of youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse . and he had not yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united again . in the character of prejudice , by the influence of a wife and family .
the doctor tubbed and got into his knickerbockers and an old norfolk jacket . then found his way to the dining room , and did full justice to an excellent breakfast . he was still pondering the problem of [male] . and at the same time wondering in another compartment of his mind in what sort of machine old [female] made her excellent coffee . when that good lady appeared , enveloped in an air of mystery .
one of the pages carried two gerfalcons upon a perch . the other a hunting horn , which he blew with a careless note at twenty paces from the castle . every one about this listless prince did what he had to listlessly , at this signal . eight guards , who were lounging in the sun in the square court . ran to their halberts , and [male] made his solemn entry into the castle .
he groped back to his chair , his chest labouring as he sat down . maisie watched him , and the fear went out of her heart . to be followed by a very bitter shame , he had spoken a truth that had been hidden from the girl through every step of the impetuous flight to [location] . for he was , indeed , down and done for -- masterful no longer but rather a little abject . neither an artist stronger than she , nor a man to be looked up to .
i started back , and looked at him in amazement . for the moment , i was incapable of answering in any other way than that . his arm trembled round me . his face flushed deep ; his eyes devoured me . some women , in my place , might have been offended ; others might have been flattered .
almost immediately the girl came forward from the shadows , with a smile apologetic for the strangeness of her attire . she had donned , over her street dress . an ample leather garment which enveloped her completely . buttoning tight at throat and wrists and ankles . her small hat had been replaced by a leather helmet which left only her eyes .
she was still considering what she should do when the taxi drew up . fate and the taxi driver had decided the matter between them . and patricia determined to go through with it and disappoint neither , having paid the man and tipped him handsomely . she descended the stairs to the grill room . she had no idea of what it cost to dine at the quadrant .
poets are bubbles , by the town drawn in . suffered at first some trifling stakes to win : but what unequal hazards do they run ! each time they write they venture all they have won . the squire that 's buttered still , is sure to be undone , this author . heretofore , has found your favour , but pleads no merit from his past behaviour .
queen [female] was in the wood listening for the dogs . beside her were erec and the damsel , who was very courteous and fair , but those who had pursued the stag were so far from them that . however intently they might listen to catch the sound of horn or baying of hound . they no longer could hear either horse , huntsman , or hound . so all three of them drew rein in a clearing beside the road .
highly dangerous , [male] reflected in the back of his head as he backed out with a bow . a young girl unafraid of the morning sun and sitting at a little breakfast table as fresh as herself . that was a picture for a war weary man , [male] forgot for a moment his anxiety for [male] 's safety in his fear for his [female] of mind . for a doubt had been removed , the girl was straight , [female] 's one sophisticated eye had grasped that at once . a good girl , alone , and far from home , and [male] .
the very ease with which he could apparently close his hand upon the happiness within his grasp unnerved him . the talk strayed hither and thither . and went and came aimlessly , a sound of singing floated in from the kitchen . and [organization] eagerly asked her mother if she might go and see [female] . [female] 's mother had come to see her .
the wonder is , that i was not altogether overcome , but was able to complete my song as the unseen veil continued to rise . this ability came solely from the state of mental elevation in which i found myself . only because uplifted in song , was i able to endure the blaze of the dawn . but i can not tell whether she looked more of statue or more of woman . she seemed removed into that region of phantasy where all is intensely vivid .
the doctor laid his papers on the table and looked up into the white faces of the three men facing him . `` that 's all , gentlemen , '' he said , for a moment no one spoke . and on the face of each was plainly written the evidence of an emotion too deep for words . the doctor sorted out the papers in silence . glanced over them for a moment , and then reached for a large metal ash tray that stood near him on the table .
he was the marquis 's father in law . the old duke [male] laverdiere , once on a time favourite of the count d'artois . in the days of the vaudreuil hunting parties at the marquis [female] conflans ' . and had been , it was said , the lover of queen [female] . between [female] coigny and [male] lauzun .
but her strongest dependence was on the old duke , the party at the castle was almost broken up when she consulted him . she had been so far true to her husband as not to ask another guest to the house since his command . but they who had been asked before came and went as had been arranged , then , when the place was nearly empty . and when locock and millepois and [female] were wondering among themselves at this general collapse . she asked her husband 's leave to invite their old friend again for a day or two .
i found that neither moon nor watch could be looked for until the morning . the moon , of course , before the watch . and more likely to be punctual , therefore i resolved to wait , and see what those two villains did . and save the earl of brandir 's pewter box . but inasmuch as those bad men were almost sure to have seen me leaving the house and looking back .
in one such chapel , the guide showed them a low arch . beneath which the body of [female] had been buried after her martyrdom . and where it lay till a sculptor saw it . and rendered it forever beautiful in marble , in a similar spot they found two sarcophagi . one containing a skeleton , and the other a shrivelled body , which still wore the garments of its former lifetime .
to complete the picture , those of the foot soldiers as had not found place upon a ship still kept up an archery combat on the borders of the port . and from the cover of the shoreside taverns , in that quarter . also , one or two houses had been fired , and the smoke towered high in the frosty sunlight . and blew off to sea in voluminous folds , already close upon the margin of the woods . and somewhat in the line of holywood , one particular clump of fleeing horsemen riveted the attention of the young watcher on the tower .
it was a thing to which a riband was attached . an ivory miniature -- and she picked it up wondering . she stood up gazing at it , in such bewilderment to find her eyes upon it that she scarce knew what she did . she did not mean to pry ; she would not have had the daring so to do if she had possessed the inclination . but the instant her eyes told her what they saw , she started and blushed as she had never blushed before in her tame life .
in the mean time poor [female] moped -- wretched in her solitude . anticipating no such glorious joys as her mother was preparing for her ; and mr. [male] was preparing with energy for his departure into foreign parts . it was indeed a relief , her brother in law dead . and he also who had so lately been her suitor , these two men whom she had so lately seen in lusty health . proud with all the pride of outward life -- had both , by a stroke of the winds .
at length , she reached a part of the green bank . much and newly trodden , where there lay some broken splintered pieces of wood and some torn fragments of clothes . stooping , she saw that the grass was bloody . following the drops and smears , she saw that the watery margin of the bank was bloody . following the current with her eyes , she saw a bloody face turned up towards the moon .
paul , at twelve years of age . was stronger and more intelligent than most european youths are at fifteen ; and the plantations . which domingo merely cultivated , were embellished by him , he would go with the old negro into the neighbouring woods . where he would root up the young plants of lemon . orange , and tamarind trees .
the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company . the neighbourhood was not large , but the musgroves were visited by everybody . and had more dinner parties , and more callers , more visitors by invitation and by chance . than any other family , there were more completely popular , the girls were wild for dancing . and the evenings ended , occasionally , in an unpremeditated little ball , there was a family of cousins within a walk of uppercross .
me that you were true and brave and so beautiful that a woman must be afraid looking at you . and you that i was just my very self , -- loving and , no ! just loving : i have no room for anything more ! you have swallowed up all my moral qualities , i have none left . i am a beggar , where it is so sweet to beg. .
nevertheless , we will remark cursorily , there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the towns . the poacher lives in the forest , the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea . the cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men . the mountain , the sea , the forest , make savage men . they develop the fierce side , but often without destroying the humane side .
the vavasors were not very energetic on their tour , as [female] had said . they had gone out for pleasure and not for work . they went direct to interlaken and then hung about between that place and grindelwald and lauterbrunnen . it delighted him to sit still on some outer bench . looking at the mountains , with a cigar in his mouth .
with the quickness that was so marked in her character , sammy grasped the meaning of his trouble almost before young [male] himself knew fully what it was . then the girl , with much care and tact . set about helping him to see the truths which the shepherd had revealed to her . all through the summer and fall , when the day 's work was done . or on a sunday afternoon , they were together , and gradually the woods and the hills .
but to wear the armour always , to live in it , to sleep in it . to carry the ponderous protection about [male] for ever and ever , safety would be too dear if purchased by such a sacrifice of all personal ease . [male] , therefore , being a selfish and self indulgent man , only wore his armour of hypocrisy occasionally . and when it was vitally necessary for his preservation , he had imposed upon himself a penance . and acted a part in holding back for a year from the enjoyment of a splendid fortune .
such was the scene of general confusion , when sir [male] wardour . oldbuck , and [male] , made their way with difficulty into the principal square . where the town house is situated , it was lighted up , and the magistracy . with many of the neighbouring gentlemen , were assembled , and here , as upon other occasions of the like kind in [location] . it was remarkable how the good sense and firmness of the people supplied almost all the deficiencies of inexperience .
hortensio , mistake no more ; i am not licio , nor a musician as i seem to be . but one that scorn to live in this disguise for such a one as leaves a gentleman and makes a god of such a cullion . know , sir , that i am call would hortensio , tranio . [male] , i have often heard of your entire affection to bianca . and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness .
it may be asked by those , who , in a work of this kind . love to cavil at every trifling omission , whether [female] did not possess any valuable of which she could have disposed . and by that means have supported herself till mrs. beauchamp 's return . when she would have been certain of receiving every tender attention which compassion and friendship could dictate . but let me entreat these wise , penetrating gentlemen to reflect .
`` but where is the doctor ? '' exclaimed villefort ; `` where is he ? '' madame [male] villefort now deliberately descended the staircase . in one hand she held her handkerchief . with which she appeared to be wiping her face , and in the other a bottle of english smelling salts . her first look on entering the room was at noirtier .
after saying good night to the ladies , and promising to stay the whole of the next day . so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to see an interesting ruin in the crown forest . levin went , before going to bed , into his host 's study to get the books on the labor question that sviazhsky had offered him . sviazhsky 's study was a huge room . surrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it .
on the morning of the day when mr. [male] had called at the house . she had been cleaning the mantelpiece , she had rubbed the part of it which was under the clock with her duster . had accidentally struck the pendulum , and had stopped it , having once before done this . she had been severely reproved , fearing that a repetition of the offense . only the day after the clock had been regulated by the maker .
[female] had written to his two uncles , asking their advice as to saving the wreck . if anything might be saved , sir gregory had written back to say that he was an old man . that he was greatly grieved at the misunderstanding , and that messrs. block and curling were the family lawyers . parson [male] invited his nephew to come down to loring lowtown . captain marrable went to block and curling , who were by no means consolatory .
the former , on mature consideration , really offended with her companion ; and , if she laughed again at her pertness . inclined to make it no laughing matter to her , she did laugh as she saw [female] pass the window . i was sweeping the hearth , and i noticed a mischievous smile on her lips . [female] , absorbed in her meditations , or a book . remained till the door opened ; and it was too late to attempt an escape .
it took all the poetry out of her life . it brought before her , in its fullest significance . the sense of her position , if she met [female] under lord thurston 's oak . if she walked with him in the meadows that his footsteps beautified into the smooth lawns of paradise . people , vulgar , ignorant people .
smoke from the firing floated in clouds across the room . and there was a moment 's silence save for the sheriff . who was groaning and cursing under the debris of the chandelier , at the door pickering 's face appeared again anxious and frightened . i think the scene in the room and the slow progress his men were making against [male] had half paralyzed him . we were all getting our second wind for a renewal of the fight .
`` come along , then , '' said the englishman , frowning , and speaking with his mouth shut . and , with swinging elbows , he went on in front with his disjointed gait . they went into the little yard in front of the shed . a stable boy , spruce and smart in his holiday attire . met them with a broom in his hand .
at length the child arrived in the charge of an elderly person . who wept bitterly at parting with him , and a beautiful boy he was . indeed , i do not think that i ever saw such a perfect child before or since . his eyes were grey , his forehead was broad . and his face , even at that early age , clean cut as a cameo .
but she turned her face to the wall and never said a word . nor did any further conversation on these matters pass between them . then as his strength came back so did his passion for [male] revive . he was not allowed to write or even receive letters , and with this explanation of her silence he was fain to content himself . but the squire , he was told , often called to inquire after him .
faint hands will row you [male] . out beyond our sight , us with stretched arms and empty eyes on the far gleaming and marble sand. . beyond the shifting cold twilight , further than laughter goes , or tears . further than dreaming , there will be no port , no dawn lit islands , but the drear waste darkening . and , at length , flame ultimate on the deep .
[male] could not very well remain at the towers while the reputed illness of his hostess kept her to her room . he went over to swampington , therefore , upon a dutiful visit to his uncle . but rode to the towers every day to inquire very particularly after his [male] 's progress . and to dawdle on the sunny western terrace with [male] , their innocent happiness needs little description . [male] retained a good deal of that boyish chivalry which had made him so eager to become the little girl 's champion in the days gone by .
placed between the provost and the mother , both threatening . the soldiers hesitated for a moment , then took their resolution . and advanced towards the rat hole , when the recluse saw this . she rose abruptly on her knees . flung aside her hair from her face , then let her thin flayed hands fall by her side .
but then came the great and main difficulty , and that was the child ; this , she told me in so many words . must be removed , and that so as that it should never be possible for any one to discover it . i knew there was no marrying without entirely concealing that i had had a child . for he would soon have discovered by the age of it that it was born . nay , and gotten too , since my parley with him , and that would have destroyed all the affair .
here were no seals whatever , the boat 's stern touched the hard shingle . i sprang out , extending my hand to maud , the next moment she was beside me . as my fingers released hers , she clutched for my arm hastily . at the same moment i swayed , as about to fall to the sand . this was the startling effect of the cessation of motion .
a corpse poor [male] appeared to be , if ever there was one in this world . and i turned away , and felt unable to keep altogether from weeping , but the mare either could not understand . or else would not believe it , she reached her long neck forth . and felt him with her under lip . passing it over his skin as softly as a mother would do to an infant .
they were his and he was theirs . it was at first only a great emotion ; a tingling joyousness . a vast relief , as of one who sees , from a far distance , the lights in the windows of home . save for the gap between the drunken revel at the ranch and his awakening to [male] 's face bending over him in the cabin . everything was clear , still by an effort , but successfully , he could unite now the two portions of his life with only a scar between them .
may the council have mercy upon us , we had no wish to write such a question . and we knew not what we were doing till we had written it . we shall not ask this question and we shall not think it . we shall not call death upon our head . there is some word , one single word which is not in the language of men .
as for us , we respect the past here and there . and we spare it , above all , provided that it consents to be dead . if it insists on being alive , we attack it . and we try to kill it , superstitions , bigotries . affected devotion , prejudices , those forms all forms as they are .
she was a child no longer , he wanted to know if she believed in , in hell . in eternal punishment ? his peculiar voice , as if filtered through cotton wool was inaudible on the other side of the deck . poor [female] , taken very much unawares , made an inarticulate murmur . shook her head vaguely , and glanced in the direction of the pacing [female] who was not looking her way . it was no use glancing in that direction .
leo , who was growing really attached to this remarkable young person , was in a great state of alarm and distress . and i , to be perfectly candid , was in a condition not far removed from superstitious fear . the whole scene was an uncanny one , presently , however , she recovered , and sat up with an extraordinary convulsive shudder . nay , she answered again , i saw naught , ask me not what i saw . why should i fright ye ? and then , turning to leo with a look of the most utter tenderness that i ever saw upon the face of a woman .
to such monitions she began not to answer back -- a symptom very dangerous , she set up a basset table . that , if anything could , must proclaim her a woman of fashion . a woman , indeed , who had a fancy to be a trifle daring . there 's no doubt that alison about this time and afterwards did want to dabble in danger . she was not her father 's daughter for nothing .
[male] went every day to [male] bury that week . his mind seemed restless -- he was doubly kind and attentive to me . but every night i heard him go out in all the storm to walk upon the common . i longed to follow him , but it was best not , on the saturday morning . coming to breakfast , i heard him ask mrs. [female] how mr. [male] was ?
after the series of fatal shocks which had overturned everything within her . she had found but one thing intact in her soul . one sentiment , -- her love for the captain . love is like a tree ; it sprouts forth of itself . sends its roots out deeply through our whole being , and often continues to flourish greenly over a heart in ruins .
an hour hence , in my master 's room i with him sat alone . and told him what a dreary gloom o'er joy had parting thrown . he little said ; the time was brief , the ship was soon to sail . and while i sobbed in bitter grief , my master but looked pale . they called in haste ; he bade me go .
then other troubles came on , some of these little girls were sickly , some very sickly . lady [female] had her faults . and they were such as were extremely detrimental to her husband 's happiness and her own . but that of being an indifferent mother was not among them . she had worried her husband daily for years because he was not in parliament .
`` amen , so be it , '' cried the clerk . who was far behind , being only a shoemaker , then parson bowden read some verses from the parish bible . telling [male] to lift up our eyes , and look upon the fields already white to harvest . and then he laid the bible down on the square head of the gate post . and despite his gown and cassock , three good swipes he cut off corn .
of all sights in the world there is , i think , none more beautiful than that of a pack of fox hounds seated . on a winter morning , round the huntsman . if the place of meeting has been chosen with anything of artistic skill . it should be in a grassy field , and the field should be small . it should not be absolutely away from all buildings , and the hedgerows should not have been clipped and pared .
olivia , blame not this haste of mine . if you mean well , now go with me and with this holy man into the chantry by . there , before him , and underneath that consecrated roof . plight me the full assurance of your faith . that my most jealous and too doubtful soul may live at [male] , he shall conceal it whiles you are willing it shall come to note .
she even went so far as to ask her husband one day if he had ever heard that the house was haunted . and whether there was any record of crime or wrong that had been done in it in the past . mr. [male] seemed scarcely to relish the question . but after one of his meditative pauses laughed his wife 's inquiry to scorn . and told her that there were no ghosts at wyncomb except the ghosts of dead rats that had ravaged the granaries .
the dancers were going faster and faster , and the musicians , to keep up with them . belaboured their instruments like jockeys lashing their mounts on the home stretch . yet it seemed to the young man at the window that the reel would never end . now and then he turned his eyes from the girl 's face to that of her partner . which , in the exhilaration of the dance , had taken on a look of almost impudent ownership .
so the histories say , and it is all quite wrong , as anyone who cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself . the russians did not seek out the best position but , on the contrary , during the retreat passed many positions better than borodino . they did not stop at any one of these positions because kutuzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen . because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough . and because miloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia , and for many other reasons .
miss [female] said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed . but when she had exasperated every one , except [female] , by a refusal . she turned round and exasperated [male] by an acceptance . as they walked up the garden , the orange cactus fell . and mr. [male] 's last vision was of the garden child clasping it like a lover .
they thus appeared to be taking her , together , for the moment . and almost for sociability , as prepared to proceed to gratuitous extremities ; the upshot of which was in turn . that after much interrogation , auscultation , exploration , much noting of his own sequences and neglecting of hers . had duly kept up the vagueness , they might have struck themselves . or may at least strike us , as coming back from an undeterred but useless voyage to the north pole .
he had thrust a volume in either pocket and in the train he dared not draw them out . but the detested words leaped at him from the folds of the evening paper . the air seemed full of [male] name . the motion of the train set it dancing up and down on the page of a magazine that a man in front of him was reading ... at the door he was told that mrs. glennard was still out .
at 7:15 bryce cardigan entered the restaurant and was escorted by the waiter to the table occupied by o. and party . at 9:30 entire party left restaurant and entered a napier car driven by a half breed indian whom the second young lady hailed as [female] . o. and the brunette young lady were dropped at 846 elm street while cardigan and the other young lady proceeded directly to no . 38 redwood boulevard , after aiding the lady to alight . cardigan talked with her a few minutes at the gate .
he had burned his ships , and stood now on an unfriendly shore . the first sacrifice to his jealous god had been consummated , and now , live or die . he stood pledged to win his fight , winter set in early and continued late . which in the end was a good thing for the year 's cut . the season was capricious , hanging for days at a time at the brink of a thaw .
the burning sun of [location] had not yet attained its highest point in the horizon . when a knight of [organization] , who had left his distant northern home and joined the host of the crusaders in [location] . was pacing slowly along the sandy deserts which lie in the vicinity of the dead sea . or , as it is called , the lake asphaltites . where the waves of the jordan pour themselves into an inland sea .
he took his position in the stern . and jeanne lay back among the bearskins , for a long time after that [male] paddled in silence . he had hoped that jeanne would give him an opportunity to continue their conversation . in spite of his advice to her to secure what rest she could . but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe .
but little by little his face seemed to grow out of the shadow , until she saw it all . the handsome patrician features , the luminous blue eyes , the amber moustache . the face which , in oakley street eight years ago . she had elected as her type of all manly perfection . her ideal of heroic [female] .
she would not have minded it , she said . if he had been a roman catholic , and whether the punishment might be for six weeks or for two years . what should be done with the family ? where should they be housed ? how should they be fed ? what should be done with the poor man when he came out of prison ? it was a case in which the generous , soft hearted old lady lufton was almost beside herself .
as the blue incense wreaths floated aside the curled thing on the tiger skin moved . and the light from a copper lamp like saidee 's . streamed through huge coloured lumps of glass , into a pair of brilliant eyes . a delicate brown hand , ringed on each finger , waved away the smoke of a cigarette it held . and victoria saw a small face , which was like the face of a perfectly beautiful doll .
the girl 's heart sank as they went on . for the sand seemed deep and drifted in places , she felt she was losing time . the way ahead looked endless , as if they were but treading sand behind them which only returned in front to be trodden over again . it was to her like the valley of the dead , and she longed to get out of it . a great fear lest the moon should go down and leave her in this low valley alone in the dark took hold upon her .
[organization] , my [female] , what a face you have got . do come and sit still for a few minutes , or you will be in a fever . while mrs. [female] was wiping her girl 's brow . and smoothing her ringlets , [female] walked off to the orchard by herself . there was a broad green path which made the circuit of it .
the two women made their little picture of the life they were to lead when clarissa had found a kindly dealer to give her constant employment . a tiny cottage , somewhere in kent or surrey . among green fields and wooded hills , furnished ever so humbly , but with a garden where lovel might play . clarissa sketched the ideal cottage one evening . a bower of roses and honeysuckle .
poor mrs. arundel took a mental photograph of all the complicated horrors of the situation . an offended father ; a gentle , loving girl crushed like some broken [female] . gossip , slander ; misery of all kinds . and then the lady plucked up courage and gave her recreant son a sound lecture . to the effect that this conduct was atrociously wicked ; and that if this trusting young bride .
altogether , marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own yard . where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown leaves . [female] was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out . [male] submitted calmly to be kissed , but [male] responded to [male] 's welcome with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement . `` i am mr. [male] keith . ''
perhaps an anxiety for his ward 's conduct was not among the least . and whenever the circumstance occurred , he could with difficulty restrain his anger . [male] was not only a person whose amiable qualities he admired . but she was soon to be allied to him by her marriage with his nearest relation . lord elmwood , a young nobleman whom he sincerely loved .
for a gentleman who had this splendid work cut out for him . mr [male] looked a little common , and rather as if , in the course of his vast transactions . he had accidentally made an interchange of heads with some inferior spirit . he presented himself before the two ladies in the course of a dismal stroll through his mansion . which had no apparent object but escape from the presence of the chief [male] .
a word must be said to explain how it had come to pass that the life led by miss [female] had been more than commonly serious before that tragedy had befallen the family . the name of the lady who stood to [female] in the place of an aunt has been already mentioned . when a girl has a mother , her aunt may be little or nothing to her . but when the mother is gone , if there be an aunt unimpeded with other family duties . then the family duties of that aunt begin .
to [female] 's simple feelings , this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant . nor consistently supported ; and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out , had its inconsistency been less their friend . but [female] and maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their i know what ', . and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit . a display of family ingenuity .
the town fairly smelt of respectability . the tree shaded streets , the children in socks and small crisp laundered garments . the houses set back , each in its square of shaved lawn . all peaceful , middle class and unexciting , the last town in the world for [male] . the last profession , the last house , this shabby old brick before him .
peter sensed sharply the change in his master without knowing the reason for it . just as the world had changed for jolly [male] , so jolly [male] had changed for [female] . they landed on a beach of sand . soft as a velvet carpet , [female] jumped out . a long legged sandpiper and her mate ran down the shore ahead of him .
i asked her how she could answer for what i meant ? she could always answer , she replied , for my meaning nothing wrong . i thanked her , but said i would prefer to answer for myself and to myself . her other servants would probably be grateful for good characters , but i wanted none . other conversation followed , and induced me to ask her how she knew that it was only necessary for her to make a suggestion to me .
this cry of pain must be silenced in me . so long as i continue to suffer , bimala will never have true freedom . i must free her completely , otherwise i shall never gain my freedom from untruth ... i think i have come to the verge of understanding one thing . man has so fanned the flame of the loves of men and women .
if the matter was interesting to the public before , it became doubly interesting now . it was of course known to everybody that madame goesler had undertaken a journey to bohemia . and , as many supposed , a roving tour through all the [female] parts of unknown [location] . [location] , [location] , and the principalities for instance . with the object of looking for evidence to save the life of [female] finn .
his half-brother moved softly about the house now in a sort of self effacement . never daring to intrude upon sir [male] 's abstractions , he was well acquainted with their cause . he knew what had happened at [male] court . knew that [male] had dismissed sir [male] for all time . and his heart smote him to think that he should leave his brother to bear this burden that rightly belonged to his own shoulders .
`` come , two or three more such adventures , and i do not despair of seeing you a member of the academy . '' doubtless [male] was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready . [male] 's love had not taken away his appetite . he hastened with [organization] to seat himself . free to recommence the discussion after dinner , after dinner .
some -- not much -- scandal , and a fair share of small talk . it was late when sir [male] entered . and , advancing to where the princess stood , kissed her gloved hand with all the submissive deference of a courtier . the most lynx eyed observer could not have detected either in his manner or in hers that any intimacy existed between them . much less friendship ; least of all , anything still closer , his bearing was a most studied and respectful homage .
the waiter looked disgusted , and [organization] hurried out , bannon gathered up the flags and came to the platform . [male] could not face him , for an instant she had a wild impulse to follow [organization] . she finally turned her back on bannon and leaned her elbows on a chair . looking over the wall for a good place to hang the flags . she was going to begin talking about it as soon as he should reach the platform .
ah , my boy , i know why . i know why , said bartle kindly , going up to [male] and raising his hand up to the shoulder that was almost on a level with his own head . `` you have had a rough bit o '' road to get over since i saw you . a rough bit o road , but i am in hopes there are better times coming for you . i have got some news to tell you .
when he came to himself he knew that several hours had passed . he pitched onto the bed and rolled over on his face with a deadly fear that he was going mad . he wanted people , people , some one sane and stupid and good . he lay for he knew not how long without moving , he could feel the little hot veins on his forehead standing out . and his terror had hardened on him like plaster .
a soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship . however far he has walked , whatever strange , unknown , and dangerous places he reaches . just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks , masts , and rigging of his ship . so the soldier always has around him the same comrades . the same ranks , the same sergeant [male] ivan mitrich .
how weak am i , said [male] , when he was gone , that i could shed tears at this reception ! i , who have never experienced anything else ; who have never expected anything else . he not only could , but did , it was the momentary yielding of a nature that had been disappointed from the dawn of its perceptions . but had not quite given up all its hopeful yearnings yet , he subdued it . took up the candle , and examined the room , the old articles of furniture were in their old places .
but lawless only laughed and staggered , and tried to clap young [female] on the back . and just then [male] 's quick ear caught a rapid brushing in the [location] . he leaped towards the sound , and the next moment a piece of the wall-hanging had been torn down . and [male] and the spy were sprawling together in its folds . over and over they rolled , grappling for each other 's throat , and still baffled by the [location] .
he had never spoken as yet to lord brentford since the day on which the earl had quarrelled with him . nor had he ever been at the house in portman square . lady [male] he met occasionally , and had always spoken to her , she was gracious to him . but there had been no renewal of their intimacy , rumours had reached him that things were going badly with her and her husband . but when men repeated such rumours in his presence .
after half an hour he guessed that jeanne had taken him at his word . and was asleep , it was disappointing , and yet there came a pleasurable throb with his disappointment . jeanne trusted him , she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child . fear of her enemies no longer kept her awake or filled her with terror . this night , under these stars , with the wilderness all about them .
all these things should be done without fail , and the sweat of the armpits should also be removed . meals should be taken in the forenoon , in the afternoon . and again at night , according to charayana , after breakfast . parrots and other birds should be taught to speak , and the fighting of cocks . quails , and rams should follow , a limited time should be devoted to diversions with pithamardas .
no precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from communication with him that day . yet this again increased my restlessness , i started at every footstep and every sound . believing that he was discovered and taken , and this was the messenger to tell me so . i persuaded myself that i knew he was taken . that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment .
`` what have not i been asked yet ? '' demanded mrs. [female] , coming lightly toward them from a door at the side of the salon . she gave her hand to colville with the prettiest [female] . and a cordiality that brought a flush to her cheek . there had really been nothing between them but a little unreasoned coolness . if it were even so much as that ; say rather a dryness , aggravated by time and absence .
on hearing this i bid her goodbye and a long farewell . as i told her i did not expect to ever see her again , then leaping to the back of my faithful horse i rode like mad across the mexican plains . until i had somewhat cooled down , but it was a hard blow to me . as i truly loved her , after that i joined the boys and returned up the trail with them . six or seven months later we were again in old [location] with a herd of cattle and went in camp some distance out from the city .
`` ca not we go now ? '' she cried to [female] . who was watching the water on the steps , to see if it would get any lower . it seemed to fascinate him , he looked at her and nodded . the little dark boats had moved nearer , people were crowding curiously along the hedge by the high road . to see what was to be seen , [female] and ursula went to the cottage with the key .
like some huge many limbed animal , the regiment began to prepare its lair and its food . one part of it dispersed and waded knee deep through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village . and immediately the sound of axes and swords . the crashing of branches , and [male] voices could be heard from there . another section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit .
annie took a many of them , all that she could find herself . and all the boys would bring her ; and she made a great hutch near the fire . in the back kitchen chimney place , here , in spite of our old [female] . annie kept some fifty birds , with bread and milk . and raw chopped meat , and all the seed she could think of .
but he was always exactly the same ; `` steady as old time , '' as mrs [female] called him . with her usual originality ; a rock of strength . under whose very shadow there is rest , as mrs. [female] had once spoken of him . so the cause of mrs. [male] 's altered manner lay not in him . yet now he was sure of a welcome , let him come at any hour he would .
this door , which [female] opened , communicated with the little passage that had been made across the room usually tenanted by captain [female] . within this room there was a still smaller chamber -- little more , indeed , than a spacious closet . in which slept the faithful old servant , [male] , both the doors were open . and [male] heard the heavy breathing of the old man . the breathing of a sound sleeper , beyond the short passage was the door opening into the sitting room used by the young heiress of [male] .
the words were like fragments torn from his heart . with them came the hated vision of the house he was going back to . of the stairs he would have to go up every night . of the woman who would wait for him there , and the sweetness of mattie 's avowal . the wild wonder of knowing at last that all that had happened to him had happened to her too .
but when i entered the kitchen place , brushing up my hair for somebody . behold it was no one greater than our annie . with my godson in her arms , and looking pale and tear begone . and at first she could not speak to me , but presently having sat down a little . and received much praise for her baby , she smiled and blushed .
young [male] replied , with acknowledgments , that he only hoped he did what was right . and what showed how entirely he was devoted to miss [female] , he wished to be unselfish . and he hoped he was , he wished to do anything as laid in his power to serve miss [male] . altogether putting himself out of sight ; and he hoped he did . it was but little that he could do , but he hoped he did it .
i blend with these enjoyments the perusal of some chosen books . which teach me to become better , they make that world . which i have abandoned , still contribute something to my happiness , they lay before me pictures of those passions which render its inhabitants so miserable . and in the comparison i am thus led to make between their lot and my own . i feel a kind of negative enjoyment , like a man saved from shipwreck .
the cook had alleged that the dinner , as regarded the eating of it . would certainly be spoilt , as to that , he had expressed a mighty indifference . if he was to have any hand in them . things were to be done according to certain rules , which , as he said . prevailed in the world of fashion , the cook .
jan thoreau listened to him . hunching his shoulders a little at the other 's manifest air of importance . in turn , the french canadian scrutinized jan good naturedly , neither of them knew the part which [male] was to play in jan 's life . every hour after the half breed 's arrival quickened the pulse of expectancy at the post . for six months it had been a small and solitary unit of life in the heart of a big desolation .
but it was all dark to [male] . he could only smell the camels , the hay bales . the cooking , the smoky fires . and the tanned canvas of the tents as he stood . where he had dropped from the train , shouting for [male] .
everything was fresh and bright , from the kindly manners of the frutigen cobbler . who hammered mountain nails into her boots . to the unfamiliar wild flowers that spangled the wayside , and capes had changed into the easiest and jolliest companion in the world . the mere fact that he was there in the train alongside her . helping her , sitting opposite to her in the dining car , presently sleeping on a seat within a yard of her .
bathsheba remained firm in this opinion till monday . when two circumstances conjoined to shake it , the first was a short paragraph in the local newspaper . which , beyond making by a methodizing pen formidable presumptive evidence of troy 's death by drowning . contained the important testimony of a young mr. [male] . [male] , of budmouth , who spoke to being an eyewitness of the accident .
this was to be his last voyage , he went on this only because his honor was pledged to do so . also , he comforted himself by thinking that he would bring back for his bride . and for the home he meant to give her . treasures of all sorts , which none could select so well as he . through the long weeks of the voyage he sat on deck .
she had never sung to any one who listened as ranald now listened to her . she forgot the others , she was singing for him . and he was compelling her to her best , she was conscious of a subtle sense of mastery overpowering her . and with a strange delight she yielded herself to that commanding influence . but as she sang she began to realize that he was thinking not of her .
there this people toils and suffers . and suffering and toil are the two faces of man . there exist there immense numbers of unknown beings , among whom swarm types of the strangest . from the porter of [male] rapee to the knacker of montfaucon . fex urbis , exclaims [male] .
rich , happily coupled are we , you see -- i am a jolly [male] tar . my star , and you are the fairest , the richest and rarest of innocent lasses you are . by far -- of innocent lasses you are , fanned by a favouring gale . you will sail over life 's treacherous sea with me . and as for bad weather , we will brave it together .
it could not be that a young adventurer such as [male] could put down an old established firm . such as his own , or banish from the scene of his labours a man of such standing in the town as himself ! it was all the fault of [male] . of [male] who never was firm on any matter . when the meeting should be over he would say a word or two to [male] .
his sweet , grave manner , so much graver and older than his years . softened too with that quiet deference which marked at once the man who reverenced all women . simply for their womanhood -- seemed entirely to reassure the young lady , this , and her own frankness of character . made her forget , as she apparently did , the fact that she was a young lady and he a young gentleman . meeting on unacknowledged neutral ground , perfect strangers , or knowing no more of one another than the mere surname .
at the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to him . a few words from his mother , stating that they were glad to know his address . and informing him that his brother cuthbert had proposed to and been accepted by mercy chant . clare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station . reaching it , he found that there would be no train leaving for an hour and more .
they could call quits -- a [male] sensation . it would have been awkward if [male] had chosen to be magnanimous nobility . but he was never intelligent , the poor [male] , he had done his best to be damaging . bless him , and in all ways had been a benefactor . for , in fact , it was a great relief to be done with alison .
there was another long evening to be got through with mrs. [female] ; but on this occasion there was the [female] occupation of dinner . which took up at least an hour ; for it was one of mrs. [female] 's fancies . one which molly chafed against -- to have every ceremonial gone through in the same stately manner for two as for twenty . so , although molly knew full well , and her stepmother knew full well , and maria knew full well . that neither mrs. [female] nor molly touched dessert , it was set on the table with as much form as if [male] had been at home .
once i had a different and strange kind of meat . but the starved stomach is not squeamish , i found a serpent coiled up in my way in a small glade . and arming myself with a long stick , i roused him from his siesta and slew him without mercy . rima was not there to pluck the rage from my heart and save his evil life . no coral snake this , with slim , tapering body , ringed like a wasp with brilliant colour .
the two young men came in presently , smelling of dust and tobacco smoke . they found [female] lying on the sofa . with her face turned to the wall , did her head still ache ? yes , as badly as ever , [male] sat down to read his sunday paper . he was very fond of a sunday paper .
at the door of the house the four men at arms had ceased to follow . and the ladies were now mounting the stairway of polished oak . under no better escort than that of the two waiting women , [male] followed close behind . it was already the dusk of the day . and in the house the darkness of the night had almost come .
there was a new buzz of excitement on the decks and in the ivy draped veranda cafe . those who had been studying [female] gabbled history , ancient and modern . until the conquest of [female] and the bombardment of 82 became a hopeless jumble in the ears of the ignorant . bores who had travelled inflicted advice on victims who had not . people told each other pointless anecdotes of `` the last time i was in [location] , ''
after a time she slowly raised her head and looked long and wistfully up the trail . then turning to the camp boss again she said . `` camp boss tell me truly if nat love works with you and did he come on this trip with you '' the boss answered her as before that i had not been seen since crossing the last mountains . which was true as i had been riding in the mess wagon .
the author of the former disturbance was now the occasion of the present . the fiend , having vainly traversed the room in search of [male] . stumbled accidentally upon harlequin , before he was freed from the relicks of his own mischief . and unable to resist the temptation of opportunity and the impulse of revenge . he gave vent to the wrath so often excited by the blunders .
it was then that a little gray singer straying through the tamaracks sent a wireless to his mate in the bushes of borderland . in which he wished to convey to her all there was in his heart about the wonders of spring . the joy of mating , the love of her . and their nest , he waited a second , then tucking his tail . swelled his throat , and made sure he had done his best .
and kill himself he did , not indeed by one sudden blow . he did not take one huge dose of his consuming poison and then fall dead upon the floor . it would perhaps have been better for himself , and better for those around him . had he done so , no ; the doctors had time to congregate around his bed . lady scatcherd was allowed a period of nurse tending ; the sick man was able to say his last few words and bid adieu to his portion of the lower world with dying decency .
speranski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to speak . he spoke slowly , with assurance that he would be listened to . and he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing . prince [male] followed [organization] 's every word and movement with particular attention . as happens to some people , especially to men who judge those near to them severely .
they rose early in those days in england . and soon after six o'clock , as [female] had seen nothing of her young [female] . she opened the door of the sleeping room and peeped in ... a minute later marjorie 's mind rose up out of [female] gulfs of sleep . in which , since her falling asleep an hour or two ago , she had wandered .
gertrude wondered much whom mrs. [female] could mean , but her wonder soon ceased . for there was a stir at the door , the crowd around it fell back as [male] cameron walked proudly into the room . bearing upon his arm [male] [female] . her fame had preceded her , for many of those present had learned that a [location] [female] and heiress was stopping at the astor . and would be present at the party , as she advanced into the room .
when we were not on the trail taking large herds of cattle or horses to market or to be delivered to other ranches we were engaged in range riding . moving large numbers of cattle from one grazing range to another . keeping them together , and hunting up strays which , despite the most earnest efforts of the range riders would get away from the main herd and wander for miles over the plains before they could be found . overtaken and returned to the main herd , then the indians and the white outlaws who infested the country gave [male] no end of trouble . as they lost no opportunity to cut out and run off the choicest part of a herd of long horns .
it was plain that her indignation was very genuine . and that her mind was as perfectly focused upon the facts as any one could wish . more so , by a long way , than aunt [female] 's mind . which seemed to be timidly circling , with a morbid pleasure , in these unpleasant shades . she and her mother together would take the situation in hand .
it ai not safe for her to be there alone in that great house , ', they said . it was strange , but now , as he looked up at his own son as he arose in the pulpit . he could seem to see a look of that fair young [male] . who had never had a son to inherit her beauty , he had certainly a delicate brilliancy of complexion . which he could have gotten directly from neither father nor mother ; and whence came that little nervous frown between his dark blue eyes ?
the tie between the dagonets , the [female] lacs of [location] . and their aristocratic cornish [male] , the trevennas . had always remained close and cordial , mr. and mrs. [male] had more than once paid long visits to the present head of the house of trevenna . the duke ofaustrey , at his country seat in cornwall and ataustrey in gloucestershire . and his [male] had frequently announced his intention of some day returning their visit ( without the duchess .
my father in law 's house was old in dignity from the days of the badshahs . some of its manners were of the moguls and pathans . some of its customs of manu and parashar . but my husband was absolutely modern , he was the first of the house to go through a college course and take his m.a , degree . his elder brother had died young , of drink .
certain things must be done which , no doubt , were costly in their nature . the bride must take with her a well-dressed lady's maid . the rooms at the folkestone hotel must be large , and on the first floor . a carriage must be hired for her use while she remained . but every shilling must be saved the spending of which would not make itself apparent to the outer world .
mr. [male] put one of the sail makers at the wheel . and the steward , relieved and starting below , was attracted to the port quarter . where the patent log that towed astern was made fast , [male] had returned his knife to him . and he was carrying it in his hand when his attention was attracted astern to our wake . [male] and [male] had managed to catch the lazily moving log line and were clinging to it .
the former , indeed , was in the habit of welcoming everybody everywhere ; but it was a proof of lady cumnor 's real affection for her distinguished son . that she allowed him to ask what she called `` all sorts of people '' to the towers , `` all sorts of people '' meant really those who were distinguished for science and learning , without regard to rank . and , it must be confessed , without much regard to polished manners likewise .
the presence of the child might have been purely accidental ; and his [male] 's wild vehemence only a paroxysm of insanity . he sighed as he left miss murrel to her scouring . the world seemed out of joint ; and he . whose energetic nature fitted him for the straightening of crooked things . had no knowledge of the means by which it might be set right .
it was only a foot and a half long . and in my superb ignorance i never dreamed that the club used ashore when raiding the rookeries measured four to five feet . the cows lumbered out of my way , and the distance between me and the bull decreased . he raised himself on his flippers with an angry movement . we were a dozen feet apart .
dom claude 's air was even more preoccupied than usual , moreover , since the nocturnal adventure in the cell . he had constantly abused quasimodo , but in vain did he ill treat . and even beat him occasionally , nothing [male] the submission . patience , the devoted resignation of the faithful bellringer . he endured everything on the part of the archdeacon .
washed and brushed and greatly refreshed , [female] stood at the window of her compartment as the train steamed into charing cross . the doctor was stationed exactly opposite the door when her carriage came to a standstill . mere chance , and yet , to [male] , it seemed so like him to have taken up his position precisely at the right spot on that long platform . an enthusiastic lady patient had once said of deryck brand . with more accuracy of definition than of grammar .
that the groceries should abound in english biscuit and our own canned fruit and vegetables . and that the grocers clerks should be ambitious to read the labels of the [male] baked beans . he heard -- though he did not prove this by experiment . that the master of a certain trattoria had studied the doughnut of new england till he had actually surpassed the original in the qualities that have undermined our digestion as a people . but above all it interested him to see that intense expression of [male] civilisation .
the amiable conjecture does no harm , and may therefore be safely left uncontradicted , far from saying nay . indeed , i will permit the reader to picture me . for the next eight years , as a bark slumbering through halcyon weather . in a harbour still as glass -- the steersman stretched on the little deck . his face up to heaven , his eyes closed : buried , if you will .
suddenly [female] opportunity flickered before him . and in his high mood he paused not at all to consider it . but insanely chased it , he had just reached a crossing . and down the cross street , walking away from noble , was the dim figure of a man carrying an umbrella . it was just perceptible that he was a fat man .
the subsidence exhibited the extent of the ravages of the surf . this last escalade had not been ineffectual , the breakwater had suffered this time . a long and heavy beam , torn from the first barrier , had been carried over the second . and hurled violently upon the projecting rock on which [organization] had stood but a moment before . by good fortune he had not returned there , had he done so .
there were more and sharper words from the man ; then a sudden rustle . she had sprung to her feet . mrs [organization] , thinking that the speaker was coming to rush out of the door . hastily retreated down the stairs , she need not have done so , however , for the door of the sitting room was not opened . but mrs [organization] felt it unsafe to watch on the landing again .
he felt a little twinge of rheumatism in his shoulder when he got into his room . for your room in a florentine hotel is always some degrees colder than outdoors . unless you have fire in it ; and with the sun shining on his windows when he went out after lunch . it had seemed to colville ridiculous to have his morning fire kept up . the sun was what he had taken the room for .
once , when engaged in this system of training , and stooping to remove bits of stick . fern stalks , and other such fragments from the child 's path . that the journey might not be brought to an untimely end by some insuperable barrier a quarter of an inch high . she was alarmed by discovering that a man on horseback was almost close beside her . the soft natural carpet having muffled the horse 's tread .
[male] could not sit still , he rose , and went to prop himself against the corner of the mantel piece . at a different angle from her face , but when she had pressed her handkerchief against her cheeks . she turned and looked up at him , awaiting an answer . they were both silent , he could not persuade himself to say more unless she led up to it by a question . and she was apparently meditating something that she had to say .
she became much absorbed in these very womanly reflections ; and at last lady constantine sighed . perhaps she herself did not exactly know why , then a very soft expression lighted on her lips and eyes . and she looked at one jump ten years more youthful than before . quite a girl in aspect , younger than he . on the table lay his implements ; among them a pair of scissors .
his last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way . both princess [female] and [female] . who did not leave him , felt this , they did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that they were not attending on him ( he was no longer there . he had left them ) but on what reminded them most closely of him , his body . both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief .
but [female] , as her mother well knew , had forgiven this man altogether . had made excuses for him which cleansed his sin of all its blackness in her own eyes . and was to this day anxious as ever for his welfare and his happiness . mrs. [male] feared that [male] did in truth love him still . if it was so , was she not bound to show her this letter ?
there is no doubt but that the privilege of matrimony offers opportunities to money loving young men which ought not to be lightly abused . too many young men marry without giving any consideration to the matter whatever . it is not that they are indifferent to money . but that they recklessly miscalculate their own value , and omit to look around and see how much is done by those who are more careful . a man can be young but once , and , except in cases of a special interposition of providence .
with respect to her outward course she could at least tell herself that she had held to her purpose . she had , as people said , `` kept up '' during the twenty-four hours preceding [female] darrow 's departure . had gone with a calm face about her usual business , and even contrived not too obviously to avoid him . then , the next day before dawn , from behind the closed shutters where she had kept for half the night her dry eyed vigil . she had heard him drive off to the train which brought its passengers to [location] in time for the calais express .
the very question that had formerly tormented him , the thing he had continually sought to find . the aim of life -- no longer existed for him now . that search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared temporarily . he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again . and this very absence of an aim gave him the complete .
subconscious self may have had an undesirable way of expressing itself . but there was no denying the truth of what it said , its words carried conviction . mr pickering replaced the ring in his pocket . and , burying his head in his hands , groaned in bitterness of spirit . he had lost her , he must face the fact .
but it was quite evident that she declined anything in the guise of promiscuous acquaintance . and he , like her , felt lonely , there were several americans in the hotel . and he would probably meet some of the men in the bar or smoking room after the dance was ended . but he would have preferred a [female] chat with [female] that evening . and now she had gone to her room in a huff .
[female] showed by saying this , and by his glance at carfax . that he was proud of his county . and would be disappointed for it if i failed to crack the boulder , so i begged him to stoop his torch a little . that i might examine my subject , to me there appeared to be nothing at all remarkable about it . except that it sparkled here and there , when the flash of the flame fell upon it .
the old lady was a little sharp in her tone , having a prospective reference to [female] 's becoming her daughter in law . for there was this inconvenience in [female] 's position with regard to [female] . that it was not suitable to be made public , and hence the three ladies at [female] parsonage were still hoping that [female] would choose miss [female] . new visitors entered , and the drawing room was given up to music and games . while whist tables were prepared in the quiet room on the other side of the hall .
now the wisest person in all our parts was reckoned to be a certain wise woman . well known all over exmoor by the name of mother melldrum . her real name was maple durham , as i learned long afterwards . and she came of an ancient family , but neither of devon nor somerset . nevertheless she was quite at home with our proper modes of divination .
here he took fright ; his balance became disjointed . one of the scales fell into the abyss , the other rose heavenward . and javert was no less terrified by the one which was on high than by the one which was below . without being in the least in the world what is called voltairian or a philosopher . or incredulous , being , on the contrary , respectful by instinct , towards the established church .
cunning in music and the mathematics , to instruct her fully in those sciences . whereof i know she is not ignorant , accept of him . or else you do me wrong : his name is licio . born in mantua , baptista , you are welcome . sir , and he for your good sake ; but for my daughter katherine .
he cast the same glance about him . but it was so dull and sleepy that the women only pointed him out to each other in derision . meanwhile master florian , the auditor . turned over attentively the document in the complaint entered against quasimodo . which the clerk handed him , and , having thus glanced at it .
on the same day the chief of police came to [male] . inviting him to send a representative to the faceted palace to recover things that were to be returned to their owners that day . as he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned down . he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins . the picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tumble down walls of the burned out quarters of the town .
mrs. [female] , an elderly person . who looked after a bachelor 's establishment two doors up , and generally slipped in about tea time . soon began to speak of [male] as a very nice young man who would be likely to make a woman happy . but esther moved about the kitchen in her taciturn way , hardly answering . suddenly she told mrs. [female] that she had been to dulwich with him .
she ran till she was out of breath and stood against a wall panting and trembling . she hated the darkness , for it seemed vaguely threatening . the thin music of the crickets made it feel as if it were charged with some electric fluid in which the silence grew more awfully intense . it came to her , with a sudden shock , that if she were to return to roscarna she must pass that dreadful spectacle again , and alone . the only thing that she could possibly do to save herself from this calamity .
but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger . and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut . nor ran foul of a dung cart ; and [female] . with some amusement at their style of driving . which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs .
all but bates , he remained rigid—that curious smile on his blood smeared face . his eyes bent toward the end of the great fireplace back of me . that look on his face held , arrested , numbed me ; i followed it . i forgot [male] ; a tacit truce held [male] all again . i stepped back till my eyes fastened on the broad paneled chimney breast at the right of the hearth .
it was there that they would stay ; they would live in a low . flat roofed house , shaded by a palm tree , in the heart of a gulf . by the sea , they would row in gondolas . swing in hammocks , and their existence would be easy and large as their silk gowns . warm and star spangled as the nights they would contemplate , however , in the immensity of this future that she conjured up .
so , looking upward to the heavens , he beheld the infinite buddha . high and lifted up in a great raying glory , about him were the exalted bodhisattwas . the mighty disciples , great arhats all . and all the countless angelhood , and these rose high into the infinite until they could be seen but as a point of fire against the moon . with this golden multitude beyond all numbering was he .
the miss thorpes were introduced ; and miss morland , who had been for a short time forgotten . was introduced likewise , the name seemed to strike them all ; and , after speaking to her with great civility . the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest , `` how excessively like her brother miss morland is ! '' `` the very picture of him indeed , '' cried the mother . and `` i should have known her anywhere for his sister ! ''
so saying , from the ruined shrine he stept , and in the moon athwart the place of tombs . where lay the mighty bones of ancient men , old knights . and over them the sea wind sang shrill . chill , with flakes of foam . he , stepping down by zigzag paths , and juts of pointed rock .
grace no doubt looked forward to a levelling and making even of things . or perhaps even to something more prosperous than that , which should come to her relief on this side of the grave . she could not but have high hopes in regard to her future destiny . although , as has been said , she understood no more than she ought to have understood from [female] account of the conversation with [female] grantly . still , innocent as she was , she had understood much , she knew that the man loved her .
in the expiring , diffused twilight , and before the clouded night dropped its mysterious veil . it was the immensity of space made visible , almost palpable . young [male] felt it , he felt it in the sudden sense of his isolation . the trustworthy , powerful ship of his first acquaintance reduced to a speck . to something almost undistinguishable , the mere support for the soles of his two feet before that unexpected old man becoming so suddenly articulate in a darkening universe .
the young man 's voice grew tremulous as he made this grand announcement . whatever enthusiasm there was in his nature seemed concentrated in the emotions of this one day . he had loved for the first time , and declared his love . his true and constant heart , that wondrous aloe which was to bear a single flower . had burst into sudden blossom , and all the vigour of the root was in that one bright bloom .
we are very important persons now in `` 258 , '' [female] and i come in for a great deal of reflected glory . it 's quite a social strain to be living in the same house with a president . we beat the freshmen at basket ball yesterday . of course we are pleased -- but oh , if we could only beat the juniors ! i would be willing to be [female] and blue all over and stay in bed a week in a witch hazel compress .
mrs. [female] did not figure in the list . and this was an obstacle the less to [female] 's finding her host alone . he sat in a complicated mechanical chair , at the open window of his room . looking westward over the park and the river . with his newspapers and letters piled up beside him .
twelve o'clock arrived ; the bell rang for a suspension of labour . the workpeople went off to their dinners ; [organization] , too , departed , desiring me to lock the counting house door . and take the key with me , i was tying up a bundle of papers . and putting them in their place , preparatory to closing my desk . when crimsworth reappeared at the door , and entering closed it behind him .
the king was unarmed , and [male] in no better plight . their hunting weapons were in the adjoining room . and rupert seemed to bar the way , i have said that the king was no coward . yet i think , that the sight of rupert , bringing back the memory of his torments in the dungeon . half cowed him ; for he shrank back crying , `` you ! ''
and who was he , the questioner , that he should dare so lightly to ask of her heart 's secrets ? that he should dare to ask her to tell , before that multitude assembled there . what woman usually whispers with blushes and tears . and many hesitations , to one ear alone ? so , for an instant . a look of indignation contracted [female] 's brow .
it was as if all that had befallen in the last five years had been wiped out of existence . his fierce relentless hatred of his half-brother , his burning sense of wrong . his parching thirst for vengeance , became on the instant all dead , buried , and forgotten . more , it was as if they had never been , [male] in that moment was again the weak . comely , beloved brother whom he had cherished and screened and guarded , and for whom when the hour arrived he had sacrificed his good name .
he stepped through the gate of the railings . out upon the plank , and offered her his hand , she looked back . the young men in the vanguard were crushing their shoulders against the row behind them . to stay the oncoming host , she had half a mind to go back through the midst of them . but she really did want her tea , and she followed the duke on to the barge .
but she wrestled with this absorbing grief as with a sin . setting her will steadfastly to the purposes of each day 's duty . and , most of all , to the duty of joyfulness , she repeated to herself father salvierderra 's sayings . till she more than knew them by heart . and she spent long hours of the night in prayer .
but mrs. [organization] had one more touch to add to the picture . she took from the back of her chair a white silken scarf . with which she had covered her shoulders in the early part of the evening . she draped it across the boy in graceful folds . and in a way to conceal his [male] , conventional evening dress .
she paused , looking down the road , and listened again ; but no sound came to her save a distant howl of a wolf . the moon rode high and clear by this time . and it seemed not so lonely here , with everything bathed in soft silver . as it had in the darkening cabin with its flickering candle . she laid the old coat over the horse 's back .
her confusion , and too evident despair when she heard of the offer to the [female] girl . had plainly told her tale , he could not now plead to his father that [male] would refuse his offer . but his self defence , when first he found that he had lost himself in love for the american . had been based on that idea , he had done his best to make [male] understand him . if he had not actually offered to her , he had done the next thing to it .
the sudden tears , brimming over ellie 's lovely eyes . and threatening to make the blue circles below them run into the adjoining carmine . filled susy with compunction , in the dusk . while their prow slid over inverted palaces , and through the scent of hidden gardens . she leaned against him and murmured , her mind returning to the recent scene with ellie .
as these people passed him standing still in the court yard . and one of them turned back to inquire if he could assist him with his services . it came into [male] 's mind that he would speak to little [male] again before he went away . she would have recovered her first surprise , and might feel easier with him . he asked this member of the fraternity ( who had two red herrings in his hand .
i am glad that you feel that . my dear , said mr. [male] , he spoke quietly and bowed his head a little . but there was still an uneasy feeling in his eyes as he looked at her . `` but you do forgive me ? '' said [female] . with a quick sob , in her need for some manifestation of feeling she was ready to exaggerate her own fault .
that there was some such reason , sir [male] was well sure . but let it be what it might , he would get the better of the doctor . `` he knew , '' so he said to himself . `` what stuff girls were made of , baronets did not grow like blackberries . '' and so , assuring himself with such philosophy , he determined to make his offer .
no more business was discussed by the squire that afternoon . indeed it interested mr. [male] . who was above all things a student of character . to observe how wonderfully the old gentleman threw off his trouble , to listen to him energetically arguing with the rev . mr. [male] as to whether or no it would be proper .
thus dallying with his souvenirs , he examined the writing and the style of the letters . as varied as their orthography , they were tender or jovial . facetious , melancholy ; there were some that asked for love , others that asked for money . a word recalled faces to him , certain gestures . the sound of a voice ; sometimes , however , he remembered nothing at all .
that night , alone in new surroundings , he was long unable to sleep . he read awhile and then put out his candle , but relit it . it was hot in the room , the inside shutters of which were closed . he was cross with the stupid old man . who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town .
well , with that he took a fit of laughing . and handing the rest out of the boat , he made me come along at his side , discoorsin me about my thravels , and all i seen . and all i read , till we reached an elegant little cottage on a bank right over the lake . and then he brought me in and made me take tay with the family .
the fancied object was not fixed , either : his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence . and , even in speaking to me , were never weaned away , i vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food . if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties . if he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread . his fingers clenched before they reached it .
`` i had my chat with purdew after luncheon , '' answered mr. [male] ; and then he went on turning the leaves for clarissa with a solemn air . and occasionally pointing out to her some noted feature in a landscape or city . his daughter stared at him in supreme astonishment . she had seen him conventionally polite to young ladies before to night .
`` oh , but , '' said scrap quickly , for he could not have come on a better day . when up there waiting and watching for her was , she knew , the enamoured briggs . `` i am really very glad indeed to see you , tell me about mother . '' scrap wanted to know so much about her mother that [male] had presently to invent . he would talk about anything she wished if only he might be with her for a while and see her and hear her .
[male] catches of me . it is true ; but i ai not a light weight , bless ye . and he 's forced to let me down , [male] , he hears a noise . and in he trots , and as soon as i anyways comes to myself i calls to him . [male] , well i might say as i did say .
modeste ran gaily back to the salon , where [male] briere . who was sitting by the window , where he had doubtless been watching his idol . rose to his feet as if a groom of the chambers had suddenly announced . `` the queen , '' it was a movement of spontaneous respect . full of that living eloquence that lies in gesture even more than in speech .
`` oh , but this -- , '' she cried involuntarily , almost in pain . in front was a valley shut in under the sky . the last huge slopes of snow and [female] rock . and at the end , like the navel of the earth . a white folded wall , and two peaks glimmering in the late light .
he felt himself to be proud of his position . prouder than he could have been of any other that might have been vouchsafed to him . and yet amidst it all he was somewhat ashamed of his pride . the man who can do it for himself is the real man after all , ', he said . but i have got it by a fluke .
at last , the old woman and the niece came in , -- the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom . and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire . to whom i imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep . and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified [male] . then i washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust .
the sweet silence of the starry evening was crashed upon with lights and jarring sounds . [female] , who had climbed the tower with a lantern and a kitchen lamp reflector slung in a table cover . on his back , had just got his makeshift apparatus in order . and standing on a narrow shelf of floor which overhung a well like abyss . had begun his signalling to the northward , too late he realized that , for all the need of haste .
it did not stir jan thoreau . long after the wolf had passed on , he moved a little , twisting himself so that his eyes could follow the tracks made by the sledge and dogs . when he came to where the snow-covered backbone of the ridge cut itself in faint outline against the desolate coldness of the sky . there fell from him the first sound of returning life . up there he was sure that he had seen something move .
there was a kind of candour in this woman . you could see she was still in the virginity of vice . her firm walk , her supple figure . her [female] , open nostrils . her large eyes , slightly tinged with blue , indicated one of those ardent natures which shed around them a sort of voluptuous perfume .
the guards remained as a mounted picket before the principal gate . and the report was quickly spread throughout the city that [male] le capitaine of the musketeers had been arrested by order of the king . then these men were seen to be in motion , and as in the good old times of [male] . and [male] , groups were formed , and staircases were filled . vague murmurs , issuing from the court below , came rolling to the upper stories .
lillian underwood was my sworn friend , with characteristic directness she had cut the gordian knot of our misunderstanding by telling me . against dicky 's protests , all about the old secret which her past and that of my husband shared . after her story , with all that it revealed of her sacrifice and her fidelity to her own high ideals . there never again would be a doubt of her in my mind , i was proud of her friendship . although , because of my mother in law 's prejudice against them .
sometime after dusk that evening the ammunition train moved out . at a point a mile or so from the village a dispatch rider on a motor cycle stopped the rumbling lorry at the head of the procession and delivered a message . which the guide read by the light of a sheltered match . the train moved on , but it did not turn down to the village . it went beyond to a place of safety .
this must be done , he had done nothing if he did not do all this . his whole life was useless ; all his penitence was wasted , there was no longer any need of saying . `` what is the use ? '' he felt that the bishop was there . that the bishop was present all the more because he was dead , that the bishop was gazing fixedly at him . that henceforth mayor madeleine , with all his virtues .
the `` albatross '' came safely back to the pool in the early spring weather . [female] had promised [female] that she should know of his coming before ever he set foot on shore . and he contrived to keep his word , one fine march day she saw a vessel sailing up the river . with a white flag flying from the main mast , on the white flag blazed . in bright red letters , the name , [male] !
the day was fresh , with a lively spring wind full of dust . all the old ladies in both families had got out their faded sables and yellowing ermines . and the smell of camphor from the front pews almost smothered the faint spring scent of the lilies banking the altar . newland archer , at a signal from the sexton . had come out of the vestry and placed himself with his best man on the chancel step of [male] church .
that name , thus pronounced , at that obscure hour , in that unknown spot . by that strange man , made [male] start back , he had expected anything but that . the person who thus addressed him was a bent and lame old man . dressed almost like a peasant , who wore on his left knee a leather knee cap . whence hung a moderately large bell , his face .
[female] found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on . and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation , neither the dissipations of the past . and she had lived very much in the world -- nor the restrictions of the present . neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits . in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness .
on this last subject , he was now labouring with athelstane . not without having reason , every now and then , to lament , like hotspur . that he should have moved such a dish of skimmed milk to so honourable an action . athelstane , it is true , was vain enough , and loved to have his ears tickled with tales of his high descent . and of his right by inheritance to homage and sovereignty , but his petty vanity was sufficiently gratified by receiving this homage at the hands of his immediate attendants .
presently , just as i expected , back came the warriors of the doones . leaving but two or three at the gate , and burning with wrath to crush under foot the presumptuous clowns in their valley . just then the waxing fire leaped above the red crest of the cliffs . and danced on the pillars of the forest , and lapped like a tide on the stones of the slope . all the valley flowed with light , and the limpid waters reddened .
chapter xi , how the queen espied that sir [male] had slain her brother sir [male] by his sword . and in what jeopardy he was , chapter xvii . how sir [male] fought with sir bleoberis for a lady . and how the lady was put to choice to whom she would go , chapter [male] . how sir [male] and isoud were in prison .
`` i see , '' said [female] , smiling , but somewhat annoyed , `` i must remember another time . '' the days went by , and she received no sign . was he going to ignore her , was he going to take no further notice of her secret ? a dreary weight of anxiety and acrid bitterness settled on her . and yet ursula knew she was only deceiving herself , and that he would proceed .
and the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to do . and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in a whisper . at last , having duly performed the ceremony , having signed the rings with the cross . the priest handed [male] the big ring . and levin the little one , again they were puzzled , and passed the rings from hand to hand .
once , i asked wada if he had seen the crew . no , he had not , but the steward had said that in all his years at sea this was the worst crew he had ever seen . he say , all crazy , no sailors , rotten , ', wada said . he say all big fools and bime by much trouble . `` you see , '' he say all the time .
`` no , '' he said , but he held her at arm 's length by the waist . to make up his mind what his reward should be , slowly he drew her toward him until . when very close , she put her arms about his neck . and laid her cheek in gratitude against his own , this was the quintessence of pleasure for him . he felt as he had been longing to feel for years .
the sleeping rooms , too , opened upon the parlour ; that which the two ladies were to occupy was furthest from the yard , for quietness ', sake . that in which [male] and his man would sleep , upon the other side . the windows of all three looked straight out upon a little walled garden that appeared to be the property of some other house . the rooms were plainly furnished , but had a sort of dignity about them . especially in the carved woodwork about the doors and windows .
it was the force which comes of mastery . of possessorship , of fighting grimly against odds . it rose in a mighty triumph , it told him this girl belonged to him . that she was his to fight for , and he was going to fight , [male] saw the change that came into his face . for a moment after she had spoken there was silence between them .
after returning from one of our trips north with a bunch of cattle in the fall of 1872 . i received and accepted a better position with the pete gallinger company . whose immense range was located on the gila river in southern [location] . so after drawing the balance of my pay from the duval company and bidding good bye to the true and tried companions of the past three years . who had learned me the business and been with me in many a trying situation .
i should have taken a revenge in a better way than i shall now . i mean to have that kiss of ye , come , miss [female] . do you hear ? -- 't is no use for you to lurk inside there . you will have to turn out as soon as boney comes over the hill . are you going to open the door , i say .
then , perceiving her daughter 's expression of perplexity . mrs. [female] burst out laughing , katharine sat down at her table and opened a long dusty envelope . as [male] was mentioned in the course of the letter as if he were alive . it had , of course , considerable value . her immediate task was to decide whether the whole letter should be printed , or only the paragraph which mentioned [female] 's name .
in an opinion on [male] 's case . dreamer , [male] -- he would much have preferred waterbuck . but they had made him a judge ( so late in the day as to rouse the usual suspicion of a political job ) . had advised that they should go forward and obtain restitution of conjugal rights . a point which to soames had never been in doubt .
she broke upon the visitor 's view under the following circumstances . [female] said when the first dish was being put on the table . perhaps mr [male] might not have heard that [female] had left her a legacy ? [male] in return implied his hope that [male] had endowed the wife whom he adored . with the greater part of his worldly substance , if not with all , [female] said .
from the contours of her figure in its upper part . she must have had a beautiful neck and shoulders . but since her infancy nobody had ever seen them . had she been put into a low dress she would have run and thrust her head into a [female] . yet she was not a shy girl by any means .
mr. [male] blinked furtively at will , he had a suspicion that he was being laughed at . but it was not possible to include [male] in the suspicion . they found [male] painting industriously , but no model was present . his pictures were advantageously arranged , and his own plain vivacious person set off by a dove colored blouse and a maroon velvet cap . so that everything was as fortunate as if he had expected the beautiful young english lady exactly at that time .
at that moment , he for the first time indulged in this reflection . thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner . that all this trouble which he was taking was , perhaps , useless ; that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial . that he should , at least , have informed himself of that ; that he was foolish to go thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not . then he sketched out some calculations in his mind .
at last , when the tournament ceased , the wrastling began , and the norman presented himself as a challenger against all comers . but he looked like [male] when he advanced himself against achelous . so that the fury of his countenance amazed all that durst attempt to encounter with him in any deed of activity . till at last a lusty [organization] of the country came with two tall men that were his sons . of good lineaments and comely personage , the eldest of these doing his obeisance to the king entered the list .
a gray mist continually gathered behind me , when i looked back towards the past . this mist was the medium through which my eyes had to strain for a vision of what had gone by . and the form of the white lady had receded into an unknown region . at length the country of rock began to close again around me . gradually and slowly narrowing , till i found myself walking in a gallery of rock once more .
when the old lady got home she took from her top bureau drawer an inlaid box of sandalwood . it held a little , slim , limp volume , wrapped in tissue paper . the old lady 's most treasured possession , on the fly leaf was written . `` to [female] , with the author 's love . '' the old lady turned the yellow leaves with trembling fingers and .
when he had first seen mrs. [female] that afternoon she and [female] were alone together . and he had noticed something unusual about her . something unnatural and intense , indeed , he remembered he had told her that she looked like the tragic muse . could it be that the look was the look of a woman maddened by insult and jealousy . who was meditating some fearful crime ? /how did that gun go off ?
it was her intention . as she felt it to be her duty . to try to overcome all that was excessive , all that bordered on selfishness , in her affection for [female] . to call or to fancy it a loss , a disappointment . would be a presumption for which she had not words strong enough to satisfy her own humility .
sir [male] passed between them and rejoined the maiden . as she had bidden him , he went with her . still invisible , and she led him to a small house . and in it was a large and beautiful chamber , all painted with gorgeous colours . and well furnished , and there she gave him food .
[female] is the monarch of all necromancy . and [female] a prophet inferior only to [female] and [female] . [female] is the persian name of [female] 's wife . and her amour with [female] constitutes one of the finest poems in their language . it is , therefore , no violation of costume to put the names of [female] .
when the duke said that he feared that his wishes were not understood . and spoke of the inefficacy of his former declaration . he was alluding of course to the duchess and to mr. [male] . mr. [male] guessed that it might be so . and , still wishing to have the duchess for his good friend , was at once assiduous in explaining to his friends in the borough that even this letter did not mean anything .
he turned into the cloak room , and [male] went up the stairs to join derek . she felt angry and depressed , full of a sense of the futility of things . people flashed into one 's life and out again . where was the sense of it ? derek had been scowling . and derek still scowled , his eyebrows were formidable , and his mouth smiled no welcome at [female] as she approached him .
human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations . that a young person , who either marries or dies . is sure of being kindly spoken of , a week had not passed since miss hawkins 's name was first mentioned in highbury . before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind . to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when mr. [male] himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects .
so the days of the doctor 's absence were passed . and so also the first week after his return , during this week it was almost daily necessary that the squire should be with him . the doctor was now the legal holder of sir [male] 's property . and , as such , the holder also of all the mortgages on mr gresham 's property . and it was natural that they should be much together , the doctor would not .
however , they persisted , as the old-time riverman always does , so that when dawn appeared the barrier was continuous and assured . although the pressure of the river had already forced the logs against the defenses . the latter held the strain well , the storm had settled into its gait . overhead the sky was filled with gray , beneath which darker scuds flew across the zenith before a howling southwest wind . out in the clear river one could hardly stand upright against the gusts .
both mr. [male] and his wife were especially timid in taking upon themselves the cares of other people . not on that account is it to be supposed that they were bad or selfish . they were both given much to charity , and bestowed both in time and money more than is ordinarily considered necessary . even from persons in their position , but what they gave . they gave away from their own quiet hearth , had money been wanting to the daughters of his wife 's brother .
`` of course you could not go alone with [male] , '' said lady macleod , very grimly , now [male] vavasor was [male] 's brother . and was therefore also first [male] to [male] , he was heir to the old squire down in westmoreland . with whom [male] lived , their father being dead , nothing , it would seem . could be more rational than that [female] should go to switzerland with her cousins .
well , this was delicious , to lie there thinking how happy she was , but outside those shutters it was more delicious still . she jumped up , pulled on her slippers , for there was nothing on the stone floor but one small rug . ran to the window and threw open the shutters , all the radiance of april in [location] lay gathered together at her feet . the sun poured in on her , the sea lay asleep in it , hardly stirring . across the bay the lovely mountains , exquisitely different in colour .
levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee . sergey ivanovitch was only just getting up , when he had drunk his coffee . levin rode back again to the mowing before sergey ivanovitch had had time to dress and come down to the dining room . after lunch levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as before . but stood between the old man who had accosted him jocosely , and now invited him to be his neighbor .
countess [female] sat at the other end of the table . when her husband took his place she concluded . from the rapid manner in which after taking up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing before him . that he was out of humor , as was sometimes the case when he came in to dinner straight from the farm . especially before the soup , countess [male] well knew that mood of his .
it would do no good , he knew . except by relieving him of a part of his mental burden . he walked along the shore of the river and recrossed it again near the company 's offices . all were dark with the exception of the sub commissioner 's room . in that there glowed a light , the sub commissioner was keeping his promise .
since his height was such that it was impossible for him to stand upright in that low ceilinged cabin . a stool was thrust forward for him by one of the ruffians of [male] 's crew who had haled him from his confinement beneath the hatchway . he sat down quite listlessly , and stared vacantly at the skipper , master [male] was somewhat discomposed by this odd calm when he had looked for angry outbursts . he dismissed the two seamen who fetched sir [male] . and when they had departed and closed the cabin door he addressed his captive .
christmas was nigh ; the weather was cold and unfriendly , our stove was lighted . our lamp burned pleasantly on the table ; our big room looked homely and charming by these evening lights . master [male] was wide awake in honor of the occasion . and sat upon my knee while his father played the fiddle . i have not spoken of his playing before -- it was .
that i had to let pass , for there 's no getting over the truth . it is not only true that i was no samson . but it is also true that , compared with a hundred oxen , my poor pegasus was but a sorry beast of draught . but muki bagotay was not even content with this triumph , he wanted to absolutely trample me beneath his feet . and as if he had only just observed for the first time the picture of [male] painted by me .
even arblaster paused at this proposal ; but as his companion continued to insist , and [male] had the sense to keep the merest wooden indifference of expression . and only shrugged his shoulders over the delay , the skipper consented at last . and cut the cords which tied his prisoner 's feet and legs . not only did this enable [male] to walk ; but the whole network of his bonds being proportionately loosened . he felt the arm behind his back begin to move more freely .
his person had undergone a change . analogous to the change in his dress ; his figure had grown rotund and . as it were , canonical , the striking points of his face were effaced . he had still a nose , but his cheeks , fattened out , each took a portion of it unto themselves . his chin had joined his throat ; his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks .
there she was , tall , round bosomed and willowy , in her starched muslin and flapping leghorn . as he had seen her under the orange trees in the mission garden . and as he had seen her that day , so she had remained . never quite at the same height , yet never far below it : generous , faithful , unwearied . but so lacking in imagination , so incapable of growth , that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt itself without her ever being conscious of the change .
at four o'clock the four friends were all assembled with [female] , their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared . and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet . for behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future . the one was a little billet , genteelly folded , with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch . the other was a large square epistle , resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal duke .
he drew a hand across his eyes . as if to clear his vision , what he had seen was impossible , the evidence was impossible . assaulted , in deadly peril , defending either honor or love , [female] was of the blood to kill . but to creep up behind her victim -- it was inconceivable , yet there had been no struggle . even the automatic on the floor gave no evidence of that .
to some extent amory tried to play [male] as long as he knew [male] . what he said , his attitude toward life . toward her , toward himself , were all reflexes of the dead englishman 's literary moods . often she sat in the grass , a lazy wind playing with her short hair . her voice husky as she ran up and down the scale from grantchester to waikiki .
the old man returned to the chaise , but the light step and cheerful countenance were no more . sorrow filled his heart , and guided his motions ; he seated himself in the chaise . his venerable head reclined upon his bosom , his hands were folded . his eye fixed on vacancy , and the large drops of sorrow rolled silently down his cheeks . there was a mixture of anguish and resignation depicted in his countenance .
the next day [female] died -- she who had never lived save in the fetters of slavery and fanaticism . after fifty years of ceaseless labour . she had gained the affection of one person . and enough money to pay for her own funeral , willie price took a cheap lodging with the woman who had been called in on the night of [male] 's collapse . before christmas he was to sail for melbourne .
and then , as i lay back in the seat , gazing at him , a sudden [male] of light flashed across my brain . that contour of the face -- that poise of the head . where had i seen them ? where but in the portrait of [male] which hung upon the wall of the [male] cottage ! since he resembled his father , he would . of course , resemble her , another link in the chain .
sergey ivanovitch listened attentively , asked him questions . and , roused by a new listener , he talked fluently , uttered a few keen and weighty observations . respectfully appreciated by the young doctor , and was soon in that eager frame of mind his brother knew so well . which always , with him , followed a brilliant and eager conversation . after the departure of the doctor , he wanted to go with a fishing rod to the river .
his breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on , and often he could not repress a groan . i tried to rest him on the arm i could use . in any easy position ; but it was dreadful to think that i could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt . since it was unquestionably best that he should die , that there were , still living . people enough who were able and willing to identify him , i could not doubt .
the visit of the grand equerry had the ostensible excuse of an important piece of business . namely , the retrieval of an immense tract of waste land left by the sea between the mouths of the two rivers . which tract had just been adjudged by the council of state to [organization] . the matter was nothing less than putting flood gates with double bridges . draining three or four hundred acres , cutting canals , and laying out roadways .
the groined roofs rose from six columns on each side . carved with the rarest skill ; and the manner in which the crossings of the concave arches were bound together . as it were , with appropriate ornaments , were all in the finest tone of the architecture of the age . corresponding to the line of pillars , there were on each side six richly wrought niches . each of which contained the image of one of the twelve apostles .
just as in a dream when all is uncertain , unreasoning , and contradictory , except the feeling that guides the dream . so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason . the words themselves were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them . [female] spoke to [female] about her brother 's life and doings . of how she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence .
they were chatting together in that whispering tone and with the half stifled laughs peculiar to an assembly of young girls in whose midst there is a young man . the young man whose presence served to set in play all these feminine self conceits . appeared to pay very little heed to the matter , and , while these pretty damsels were vying with one another to attract his attention . he seemed to be chiefly absorbed in polishing the buckle of his sword belt with his doeskin glove . from time to time , the old lady addressed him in a very low tone .
so sitting up ; in the moonlight , with his back to [male] . his face uplifted , and his hands clasped around one knee , [male] sang . much practice had added greatly to the sweetness and flexibility of his voice . and he rendered perfectly the exquisite melody to which the words were set . the triumphant worship of the last line rang out into the night .
the boat had now begun to move slowly out of its slip , backing into the river . it was now that the man on the dock sighted the girl . she gesticulated at him , he gesticulated at her . he produced a handkerchief , swiftly tied up a bundle of currency bills in it . backed to give himself room , and then , with all the strength of his arm .
he would in such case have been at the bottom of a long list . but mr [male] was a rising man , round whom . almost without wish of his own , a party was forming itself . if he came into power , -- as come he must . according to mr [male] and many others , -- then they who had acknowledged the new light before its brightness had been declared .
plaistow manor house or hall was a fine brick mansion . built in the latter days of tudor house architecture . with many gables and countless high chimneys , -- very picturesque to the eye . but not in all respects comfortable as are the modern houses of the well to do squirearchy of england . and , indeed , it was subject to certain objectionable characteristics which in some degree justified the scorn which mr. [male] intended to throw upon it when he declared it to be a farmhouse .
mr. [male] bowed with cold politeness . mastering his irritation , but only so far as to be silent , he remembered will 's letter quite as well as [male] did . he had noticed that it was not among the letters which had been reserved for him on his recovery . and secretly concluding that [male] had sent word to will not to come to [male] . he had shrunk with proud sensitiveness from ever recurring to the subject .
but , alas , that newly born hope , which had made the soldier 's heart beat and his cheek flush . was as delusive as many other hopes that lure men and women onward in their weary wanderings upon this earth . the landlord of the white [female] inn answered [female] arundel 's question with stolid indifference , no . the young lady had gone away with her [female] , and a gentleman who came with her [female] . she had cried a deal , poor thing .
she left me , i descended at once to the churchyard . and crossed the stile which led directly to mrs. [female] 's grave . the grass about it was too short , and the ground too hard . to show any marks of footsteps , disappointed thus far , i next looked attentively at the cross . and at the square block of marble below it .
the year of which i am now writing was the year of the famous crystal palace exhibition in hyde park . foreigners in unusually large numbers had arrived already , and were still arriving in [location] . men were among [male] by hundreds whom the ceaseless distrustfulness of their governments had followed privately . by means of appointed agents , to our shores . my surmises did not for a moment class a man of the count 's abilities and social position with the ordinary rank and file of foreign spies .
after the third deluge they have no power to move him . except to move him out of the house , never threaten him . scold him nor argue with him , act ! a woman 's arguments affect a man as water does a cat . he simply waits for them to dry up -- and then he goes out and does as he pleases . never doubt his word -- even when you know he is lying .
as i turned to sit down again , i noticed , in the chair from which i had arisen . something white crushed into one corner of the seat . i picked it up , it was a handkerchief of dainty lace and it was damp , with tears ? but i shook myself together impatiently , all this was merely theorising ; i must lay my foundation first . get my facts ; then perhaps it might be possible to build a theory which would prove the right one .
biddy said no more , handsomely forgiving her , i soon exchanged an affectionate good night with her and [female] . and went up to bed , when i got into my little room . i sat down and took a long look at it . as a mean little room that i should soon be parted from and raised above , for ever . it was furnished with fresh young remembrances too , and even at the same moment i fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which i was going .
he was so transported with my consent , and the kind manner of it . that i began to think once he took it for a marriage . and would not stay for the form ; but i wronged him , for he gave over kissing me . and then giving me two or three kisses again , thanked me for my kind yielding to him . and was so overcome with the satisfaction and joy of it .
ends , no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him . in the midst of the disasters that befell the house . cocles was the only one unmoved , but this did not arise from a want of affection . on the contrary , from a firm conviction , like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor . so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse .
d'artagnan , considerably surprised , prepared to obey , [male] , went out , monk followed him . [male] followed monk , [male] took the path by which [male] had come to his abode . the fresh sea breezes soon caressed the faces of the three nocturnal travelers . and , at fifty paces from the little gate which [male] opened . they found themselves upon the down in the face of the ocean .
i began to nod drowsily over the dim page : my eye wandered from manuscript to print . i saw a red ornamented title -- 'seventy times seven , and the first of the seventy first . a pious discourse delivered by the reverend [male] . in the chapel of gimmerden sough , and while i was . half consciously , worrying my brain to guess what [male] would make of his subject .
she was crying , with her head on his breast . and her slim , half bare arms around his neck . and jolly [female] like a miser to the choking words that came with her sobs . and where there had been tumult and indecision in his heart there came suddenly the clearness of [male] and joy . and with it the happiness of a new and mighty possession as his arms closed about her .
a youth was sitting on a stool in the centre of the lead flat which formed the summit of the column . his eye being applied to the end of a large telescope that stood before him on a tripod . this sort of presence was unexpected , and the lady started back into the shade of the opening . the only effect produced upon him by her footfall was an impatient wave of the hand . which he did without removing his eye from the instrument .
it was very [female] sitting by the open windows in the summer twilight . with no artificial light in the room , except the wax candles on the piano . listening to good music , and talking a little now and then in that subdued confidential tone to which music makes such an agreeable accompaniment . [female] sat in the midst of a group in a wide bay window . and although [female] was standing near her chair , he did not this time engage the whole of her attention .
lady [female] , as she was driven home . recovered her spirits wonderfully , not a word had fallen from her father which she could use hereafter as a refuge from her embarrassments . he had made her no promise , he had assented to nothing . but there had been something in his manner , in his gait . in his eye , in the pressure of his arm .
as [female] rode to the hotel . and stopped in front of the arcade which shaded the ground floor . nevill and another man sprang up from chairs pushed back against [organization] . nothing very great so far , i am sorry to say , much as we expected , ', [male] answered . and as he spoke , he glanced at the stranger .
he embarked his cart and horse on board the boat . as to the opulent traveler , he did the same with his two horses and servant . but all the wit [male] employed in endeavoring to find out his name was lost . he could learn nothing , only he took such notice of his countenance . that it was impressed upon his mind forever .
it was a very sweet half hour before your doctor came and sent me away . i was so dazed when i got to the station that i almost took a train for st [male] . and you were pretty dazed , too , you forgot to give me any tea . but we are both very , very happy , are not we ? i drove back to lock willow in the dark but oh . how the stars were shining , and this morning i have been out with [male] visiting all the places that you and i went to together .
[male] had wished to go away before breakfast , and crosbie would not have cared how early an escape had been provided for him . but the countess had told her daughter that if she would not wait for the breakfast . there should be no breakfast at all , and in fact no wedding . nothing but a simple marriage , had there been a grand party . that going away of the bride and bridegroom might be very well ; but the countess felt that on such an occasion as this nothing but the presence of the body of the sacrifice could give any reality to the festivity .
it was principally english ; saving that it comprised the usual french count and the usual italian marchese . decorative social milestones , always to be found in certain places , and varying very little in appearance . the table was long , and the dinner was long ; and little [female] . overshadowed by a large pair of [female] whiskers and a large white cravat . lost sight of her father altogether , until a servant put a scrap of paper in her hand .
it reminded me of something i had read in my youth about the ingenious way in which the aldermen of [location] raised the money that built the mansion house . a person who had not taken the sacrament according to the anglican rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of [location] . thus dissenters were ineligible ; they could not run if asked , they could not serve if elected . the aldermen , who without any question were yankees in disguise . hit upon this neat device : they passed a by law imposing a fine of l400 upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff .
sadie ried was never fretful , never petulant , and very rarely angry ; but when she was . it was a genuine case of unrestrained rage . and woe to the individual who fell a victim to her blazing eyes and sarcastic tongue . to night [female] [male] was that victim . what right had he to arraign her before him .
`` god bless you , madam ! '' said [female] , with an irrepressible movement of love towards the beautiful . gentle creature for whom she felt unable to do anything more . now that she had finished tying the bonnet , this was too much for [female] 's highly strung feeling . and she burst into tears , sobbing against [female] 's arm .
one of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron . holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small bloodstained hands . so as not to smear it , he raised his head and looked about him . but above the level of the wounded men , he evidently wanted a little respite . after turning his head from right to left for some time .
it was a low , comfortable room , with great beams running across the ceiling . and papered with the same paper as the walls -- a piece of elegant luxury which took molly 's fancy mightily ! this parlour looked out on the dark courtyard in which there grew two or three poplars . straining upwards to the light ; and through an open door between the backs of two houses could be seen a glimpse of the dancing . heaving river , with such ships or fishing cobles as happened to be moored in the waters above the bridge .
[female] fled to the back parlour , but was discovered by exploring youths . and mortally insulted by one of them , who innocently inquired if she was mrs bhaer . the reception did not last long , and the end was better than the beginning . for the rain ceased , and a rainbow shone beautifully over them as the good fellows stood upon the lawn singing sweetly for a farewell . a happy omen , that bow of promise arched over the young heads .
`` i must go , had i known you were to have a party '' he smiled faintly -- i should not have come , you are too tired to stay up longer . forget what i have told you and go to sleep , if tomorrow you can suggest anything . i am pretty ragged and do not seem able to think clearly , you are keener than i in grasping situations . and quicker in making decisions , whatever you think might be done --
[male] was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced . [male] paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him . [male] villefort , who examined him attentively . and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use . in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes .
i found the rules of the establishment were too strict . its course of study too severe for a child of her age . i took her home with me . i meant to become her governess once more , but i soon found this impracticable . my time and cares were now required by another -- my husband needed them all .
but there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass . that , at length , i began to be weary , and told her we must halt . and retrace our steps , i shouted to her , as she had outstripped me a long way . she either did not hear or did not regard , for she still sprang on . and i was compelled to follow , finally , she dived into a hollow .
the bairns are quite well , as i told you in my other letter . and miss [female] says that little elly is as good as gold , they are with me every morning and evening . and behave like [female] angels , as they are . posy is my own little jewel always , you may be quite sure i do nothing to spoil them . after this he wrote another letter to his other daughter .
he was overcome by his own responsibility , and by the prospect of tragedy that threatened . that livingstone was clark , and that he would insist on surrendering himself when he wakened . he could no longer doubt , his mind wandered back to that day when he had visited the old house as a patient . and from that along the strange road they had both come since then , he reflected . not exactly in those terms , that life , any man 's life .
it began the moment we sat down to dinner . mr. [male] said [male] with theatrical declamation . as it now appears to me , something like a religious cross of the ghost in [male] with [female] the third . and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful , upon which my sister fixed me with her eye . and said , in a low reproachful voice , `` do you hear that ? be grateful . ''
`` exactly , and what can you conceive more deadly ? '' this was all so true . that ursula felt jarred to the bottom of her soul with ugly distaste . she went on , with the discord jarring and jolting through her . in the most barren of misery , then there started a revulsion from [female] . she finished life off so thoroughly , she made things so ugly and so final .
whilst the comte , with [male] , was busy procuring horses to go straight to [location] . [male] hastened to the hostelry where , according to his orders . his little army was to wait for him , these gentlemen were at breakfast upon oysters . fish , and spiced brandy , when [male] appeared . they were all very gay , but not one of them had yet exceeded the bounds of reason .
neatly he put away all that had been supplied him ; before lighting the burner he gave [male] a drink of milk and tried arranging both pillows to prop her up as he had been shown . when the water boiled he dropped in two [male] cubes the nurse had given him . and set out some crackers he had bought , he put the milk in two cups . and when he cut the bread , he carefully collected every crumb . putting it on the sill in the hope that a bird might come .
there was no change in him , she caught him against her . she pressed her breasts against his shoulders . she kissed his shoulder , through the sleeping jacket . her mind wondered , over his rigid , unliving body , she was bewildered . and insistent , only her will was set for him to speak to her , [female] , my dear !
it is recorded that , advancing from honour to honour , the round faced beauty was eventually chosen empress and became the mother of the imperial prince . the celestial purity of her mind and the absence of all flaws of jealousy and anger warranted this distinction . but it is also recorded that , after her elevation , no other lady was ever exalted in the imperial favour or received the slightest notice from the emperor . for the empress , now well acquainted with the ideal man . judged it better that his experiences of the ideal woman should be drawn from herself alone .
so saying , she burst from him , tore her garment from his grasp . and left the tent , the voice of neville . at the same time , summoned him from without , exhausted and stupefied by the distress he had undergone during this interview . from which he could only have extricated himself by breach of the engagement which he had formed with king [male] . the unfortunate knight staggered rather than walked after the english baron , till they reached the royal pavilion .
one thing struck me with some surprise . as i made off for our fireside ( with a strong determination to heave an ash tree up the chimney place ) . and that was how the birds were going , rather than flying as they used to fly . all the birds were set in one direction , steadily journeying westward , not with any heat of speed . neither flying far at once ; but all , partly running , partly flying , partly fluttering along .
so , at the conclusion of her morning studies . she resorted to the solace of the drawer . her father sat reading at the table . and i , on purpose , had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window curtain . keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings , never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest .
god was about him , warm and subtle , like a strange spirit . sending through him the thrill of anticipation . a hundred fancies , little fears , [male] advanced . still guiding him ; then he stopped , and chuckled softly in the darkness . the distant voice had stopped singing , and there came in place of it the loud barking of a dog .
tomorrow you come for your ring . and bring me my own ? yours is here waiting , i have it on my finger . very loose , with another standing sentry over it to keep it from running away . a mouse came out of my wainscot last night . and plunged me in horrible dilemma : for i am equally idiotic over the idea of the creature trapped or free .
winter festivities followed the more wholesome summer pleasures . and [organization] found them more costly ; for the hospitable ladies expected some return from the stranger . and carriages , bouquets , theatre tickets . and all the little expenses a young man can not escape at such times . told heavily on the purse which seemed bottomless at first , taking mr laurie for his model .
the baronet was seated in a capacious easy chair near the hearth . the bright blaze of the fire rose and fell , flashing now upon the polished carvings of the black oak bookcase . now upon the gold and scarlet bindings of the books . sometimes glimmering upon the athenian helmet of a marble pallas , sometimes lighting up the forehead of sir [male] . the lamp upon the reading table had not yet been lighted , and sir [male] in the firelight waiting for the coming of his young wife .
[female] shouldered his tool basket and resumed his lonely way . filled with an ardour at which he mentally stood at gaze . he had just inhaled a single breath from a new atmosphere . which had evidently been hanging round him everywhere he went . for he knew not how long , but had somehow been divided from his actual breathing as by a sheet of glass .
the doctor brought by levin , and found by him at the club . was not the one who had been attending nikolay levin . as the patient was dissatisfied with him , the new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded the patient . shook his head , prescribed medicine , and with extreme minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet was to be kept to . he advised eggs , raw or hardly cooked , and seltzer water .
i had no longer the strength of my first angry resistance to outrage and injury to support me . my heart sick anxiety to see [male] , my sense of my own helpless ignorance of what had happened at the boat house . pressed on me with an intolerable weight , i tried to keep up appearances by speaking to the count and his wife in the tone which they had chosen to adopt in speaking to me . but the words failed on my lips -- my breath came short and thick . my eyes looked longingly , in silence , at the door .
torarin stayed still awhile longer as he gazed at a great vessel which lay frozen in . she looked altogether out of place as she lay with the smooth and even snowfields all about her . but when [organization] saw a thin column of smoke rising from the vessel 's poop he drove up and hailed the skipper to hear if he would buy his fish . he had but a few codfish left at the bottom of his load . since in the course of the day he had been round to all the vessels which were frozen in among the islands .
that love of liberty of which she had given [female] so bold a sketch was as yet almost exclusively theoretic . she had not been able to indulge it on a large scale . but it appeared to her she had done something . she had tasted of the delight , if not of battle . at least of victory ; she had done what was truest to her plan .
she is by no means a model character . the education of all beautiful women is the knowledge of men . [male] had been disappointed in man after man as individuals . but she had great faith in man as a sex . women she detested , they represented qualities that she felt and despised in herself .
he did not finish , a second bullet from the same marksman stopped him short . this time he fell face downward on the pavement . and moved no more , this grand little soul had taken its flight , at that same moment . in the garden of the [location] , -- for the gaze of the drama must be everywhere present . two children were holding each other by the hand , one might have been seven years old .
as soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds . the wind fell , as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning after the storm . drops still continued to fall , but vertically now , and all was still , the whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it . a few minutes later it reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud . tearing its edge , everything grew bright and glittered , and with that light .
gilbert was looking at [female] , as she walked along . in her light dress , with her slender delicacy . she made him think of a white iris . breakfast at green gables that morning was a rather doleful meal . davy , for the first time in his life probably .
it was in good order , all trace of the recent interment had been removed . and its sober grey gloomed reposefully in the [female] . the whole family lay there now , except old jolyon 's wife . who had gone back under a contract to her own family vault in [location] . old jolyon himself lying at [organization] .
marius had had a furnace in his brain all day long . now it was a whirlwind , this whirlwind which was within him . produced on him the effect of being outside of him and of bearing him away . it seemed to him that he was already at an immense distance from life . his two luminous months of joy and love .
edna was not so consciously gratified at her husband 's leaving home as she had been over the departure of her father . as the day approached when he was to leave her for a comparatively long stay . she grew melting and affectionate , remembering his many acts of consideration and his repeated expressions of an ardent attachment . she was solicitous about his health and his welfare . she bustled around , looking after his clothing , thinking about heavy underwear , quite as madame ratignolle would have done under similar circumstances .
it was done , [male] snapped the hand bags . off they went , the porter coming behind , they were through a great doorway . and in the open night again -- ah , a railway platform ! voices were still calling in inhuman agitation through the dark grey air . spectres were running along the darkness between the train .
well , the king was out of the hole ; and on terms satisfactory to the church and the rest of the aristocracy , no doubt . men write many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy . but the fact remains that where every man in a state has a vote . brutal laws are impossible , [male] 's people were of course poor material for a republic . because they had been debased so long by monarchy ; and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short work of that law which the king had just been administering if it had been submitted to their full and free vote .
he had declared to himself that her welfare . [male] 's welfare , was the one thing which he should regard . and he had told himself that he was not strong enough . either in purpose or in wit , to devise schemes for her welfare . she was better able to manage things for herself than he was to manage them for her .
in consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life . all his relations with old friends , all his plans for his future . were completely altered , he was not rich , but would spend his last groat to be better dressed than others . and would rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of petersburg in an old uniform . he made friends with and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and who could therefore be of use to him .
he ran along the edge of the break . and in the direction of the forest he found a place where he could descend . in his haste he fell ; his hands were scratched . blood flowed from a cut in his forehead when he dragged himself up to the face of the cliff again . he tried to shout when he saw a figure drag itself up from among the rocks .
nevertheless , be their faults what they might , [female] 's pictures met with good acceptance among the patrons of modern art . whatever technical merit they lacked , its absence was more than supplied by a warmth and passionateness . which she had the faculty of putting into her productions . and which all the world could feel , her nature had a great deal of color . and , in accordance with it , so likewise had her pictures .
it was necessary to [male] it from a considerable distance . the end of the village towards gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds which exist in the woods there . the other end , which surrounds the church and which lies in the direction of chelles . found drinking water only at a little spring half-way down the slope , near the road to chelles . about a quarter of an hour from montfermeil .
to think that his blood flowed in the veins of [male] ! hitherto the duke had seen nothing grotesque in him . had regarded him always as a dignified specimen of priest and scholar . such a life as the warden 's , year following year in ornamental seclusion from the follies and fusses of the world . had to the duke seemed rather admirable and enviable , often he himself had meditated taking a fellowship at all souls and spending here in oxford the greater part of his life .
so i carried it for her , without any words . wondering what she was up to next , and whether she had ever heard of being too hard on the willing horse . and when we came to hog pound , she turned upon me suddenly . with the lanthorn she was bearing , and saw that i had the bock by one hand very easily . while i was wondering how my chance of having lorna could depend upon my power to carry pig 's wash .
no word was spoken out loud , but [female] was satisfied that her sister had been in earnest . now sleep , my [female] ; -- and when i have just tidied your things for the morning . i will be with you , the wanderer again obeyed . and in a few moments the work of the past two days befriended her . and she was asleep , then the sister went to her task with the soiled frock and the soiled shoes .
`` no ; it would not , '' said the earl , who was apt to be very imperious with his own daughters . although he was of opinion that they should be held in great awe by all the world . excepting only himself and their eldest brother , and now , during this easter week . lord saint [male] came down to the castle . intending to kill two birds with one stone , to take his parliamentary holiday .
his hair stood on end , he remembered those interesting stories . so little believed in [location] , respecting roman bandits ; he remembered the adventures that [male] morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle [male] . `` they are robbers , perhaps , '' he muttered . just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road . danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road .
`` antiquity produced heroes , but not gentlemen , '' someone has said , in the days of charlemagne and [male] began the training which . continued in the days of chaucer and sir [male] and many . many more , has given to this our age that highest type of manhood . the [male] gentleman , it befell in the days of uther [organization] .
wash gibbs , too , opened his eyes . just in time to witness the unheard of feat , and to see the bare armed young giant who performed it turn again . breathing heavily with his great exertion , but still ready to meet his big antagonist . the defeated bully rose from the ground , the other stepped forward to meet him . but without a word , gibbs climbed into the wagon and took up the reins .
therefore , seeing hard strife before me , i girt up my breeches anew . with each buckle one hole tighter . for the sodden straps were stretching and giving , and mayhap my legs were grown smaller from the coldness of it . then i bestowed my fish around my neck more tightly . and not stopping to look much , for fear of fear , crawled along over the fork of rocks .
but she went to bed very early , to be absolutely certain of being on time at regalberg 's monday morning . so began for [male] appleby the haunted days when , drifting through the gray and ghostly city of winter . he scarce knew whether he was a real man or a ghost . down prison corridors that the city calls streets . among jewish and italian firms of which he had never heard , he wandered aimlessly .
there was also the letter to cassandra lying on the table in the next room . the atmosphere seemed charged with cassandra , but , unless katharine began the subject of her own accord . he could not even hint -- he must ignore the whole affair . it was the part of a gentleman to preserve a bearing that was . as far as he could make it , the bearing of an undoubting lover .
and [male] waited , holding his breath , listening for an answer to the cry that went out for jolly [male] mckay . the glory of july midnight . with a round , full moon straight overhead . followed the stress of storm , the world had been lashed and inundated . every tree whipped of its rot and slag .
with this party miss milner arrived at her country house . and for near six weeks , all around was the picture of tranquillity . her satisfaction was as evident as every other person 's ; and all severe admonition being at this time unnecessary . either to exhort her to her duty , or to warn her against her folly . she was even in perfect good humour with miss [female] .
toward evening she went out of the cottage to avoid , as she said . two such long and tiresome faces , as twilight advanced , there were again tokens of a storm . and the water rushed and roared , full of alarm , the knight and the fisherman sprang to the door . to bring home the girl , remembering the anxiety of that night when huldbrand had first come to the cottage . undine , however , met them , clapping her little hands with delight .
no [male] , no youth , no beauty . could stand out against such a presentation , the king smiled , whether the words of madame were a pleasantry . or uttered in all innocency , they proved the pitiless immolation of everything that [female] had found charming or poetic in the young girl . mademoiselle [female] valliere , for madame and , by rebound . for the king , was , for a moment , no more than the daughter of a man of a superior talent over dindes truffees .
when sir [male] had finished eating . the bear seemed to wish him to follow him . and the bear led him to a brook in a little green patch . and there the knight quenched his thirst , by now it was twilight again . and sir [male] made up the fire and prepared himself to slumber .
they were worth listening to , for mr bhaer spoke like a father to the children whom he was dismissing to the battle of life . and his tender , wise , and helpful words lingered in their hearts long after the praise was forgotten . then came other exercises peculiar to plumfield , and the end , why the roof did not fly off when the sturdy lungs of the excited young men pealed out the closing hymn will for ever be a mystery . but it remained firm , and only the fading garlands vibrated as the waves of music rolled up and died away . leaving sweet echoes to haunt the place for another year .
physician had engaged to break the intelligence in [female] street . bar could not at once return to his inveiglements of the most enlightened and remarkable jury he had ever seen in that box . with whom , he could tell his learned friend , no shallow sophistry would go down . and no unhappily abused professional tact and skill prevail ( this was the way he meant to begin with them ) , . so he said he would go too , and would loiter to and fro near the house while his friend was inside .
after that there was nothing more said , [male] turned round . pretending to read his letters , and [male] descending from his seat walked out into the yard of the brewery . his intention had been , ever since he had looked around him in [male] . to be master of that place , or if not of that , to be master of some other . `` it would break my heart to be sending out such stuff as that all my life , ''
the figure stepped forth and waved its hand like a dumb person . it was arrayed like a pilgrim , the hood lowered over the face . but [male] , in an instant , recognised sir [male] . he strode up to him , drawing his sword . and the knight , putting his hand in his bosom .
17 , the name by which buddha was known when a prince . before renouncing the world , how could we help thinking that it was all supernatural ? this moment of our history seemed to have dropped into our hand like a jewel from the crown of some drunken god . it had no resemblance to our past . and so we were led to hope that all our wants and miseries would disappear by the spell of some magic charm .
once i took my fellow prisoner and my jailer to my villa at svabhegy . where my wife had made ready for [female] a splendid supper . i tapped my new wine , and we amused ourselves to such a very late hour that when we returned they would hardly let [male] into prison again . fortunately we had the provost with us . and with our assistance he managed to force his way in .
lady clavering could not press him to go at once , and , therefore , it was settled as he proposed . she would write to [location] immediately , and he would go up to [location] after three or four days . `` if we only knew of any apartment , we could write , '' said lady clavering , you could not know that they were comfortable , ', said [male] . `` and you will find that i will do it in plenty of time . ''
when at last my tale was done , she turned away , and wept bitterly for the sad fate of her parents . but to my surprise she spoke not even a word of wrath or rancour . she seemed to take it all as fate . `` lorna , [female] , '' i said at length . for men are more impatient in trials of time than women are .
but bill did not pass a good night , he lay awake long . thinking over his plans for the morrow , lady wetherby was feeling battered . she had not realized how seriously roscoe sherriff took the art of publicity . nor what would be the result of the half hour he had spent at the telephone on the night of the departure of [female] . roscoe sherriff 's eloquence had fired the imagination of editors .
he wished to overtake her , and speak to her . to see how she would receive him , now she must know he was aware of some other attachment . he wished too , but of this wish he was rather ashamed . that she should know that he had justified her wisdom in sending [male] to him to ask for work . and had repented him of his morning 's decision .
a double personification was not difficult to him , he had encountered it with every model that had sat to him . and with every young lady he had attempted to win , -- if he had ever made such an attempt with one before . but the triple character , joined to the necessity of the double work . was distressing to him , `` the hand a little further back , if you do not mind , '' he said , and the wrist more turned towards me .
it was not until evening was nearly closed that ivanhoe was restored to consciousness of his situation . he awoke from a broken slumber , under the confused impressions which are naturally attendant on the recovery from a state of insensibility . he was unable for some time to recall exactly to memory the circumstances which had preceded his fall in the lists . or to make out any connected chain of the events in which he had been engaged upon the yesterday . a sense of wounds and injury .
a murmur of dissent from maisie . he went on -- 'and i know by what you have just said that you are on the wrong road to success . it is not got at by sacrificing other people , -- i have had that much knocked into me . you must sacrifice yourself , and live under orders . and never think for yourself , and never have real satisfaction in your work except just at the beginning .
darya alexandrovna had done her hair . and dressed with care and excitement , in the old days she had dressed for her own sake to look pretty and be admired . later on , as she got older , dress became more and more distasteful to her . she saw that she was losing her good looks . but now she began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again .
we must acknowledge that the unpleasant tone of the [female] 's letter was due quite as much to the ill usage he had received in reference to that journey to [male] . as to the loss of the race , within that little body there was a high mounting heart . and that heart had been greatly wounded by his lordship 's treatment . [male] had felt himself to have been treated like a servant . hardly an excuse had even been made , he had been simply told that he was not wanted .
a puff , slightly stronger than usual , struck [male] just then , the boat was caught as it obliquely crossed the crest of a wave . it went over suddenly , burying its gunwale level with the sea and shipping a bucketful or so of water . i was opening a can of tongue at the moment . and i sprang to the sheet and cast it off just in time . the sail flapped and fluttered , and the boat paid off , a few minutes of regulating sufficed to put it on its course again .
lucy , with a demure and settled air . seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others . and would not say a word ; and almost every thing that was said , proceeded from [female] . who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother 's health . their coming to town , and [female] which [female] ought to have inquired about .
the clarity , the delicacy , of her cheeks were such as you may see on one of those roses which . white in full flower , have a [female] flush on the outer petals of the bud . and the same rose open may serve for the likeness of a neck and bosom which she guarded no more prudishly than her day 's fashion demanded . for all the daintiness , her lips . a proud pair , were richly red ( stained of raspberries , in [female] sneer ) .
`` i accept your apology , '' said i , `` but let 's hurry home . '' there was but one residence to pass , and that , thank fortune , was so densely screened by shrubbery that the inmates could not see the road . to be sure , we were on a favorite driving road . but we could reach home in five minutes . and we might dodge into the woods if we heard a carriage coming , ha !
but notwithstanding his worship is not known in many divers countries . but this shall i give you in penance , make ye as good shift as ye can . ye shall bear this lady with you on horseback unto the pope of [male] . and of him receive your penance for your foul deeds . and ye shall never rest one night whereas ye do another ; an ye go to any bed the dead body shall lie with you .
not even mrs. [female] had sought me , `` friends always forget those whom fortune forsakes , '' i murmured , as i undrew the bolt and passed out . i stumbled over an obstacle : my head was still dizzy . my sight was dim , and my limbs were feeble , i could not soon recover myself . i fell , but not on to the ground : an outstretched arm caught me .
then he fell to imagining that he looked once more and found it there . and what it would be like if she loved him . she who , as alexandra said , could give her whole heart . in that dream he could lie for hours . as if in a trance , his spirit went out of his body and crossed the fields to [male] shabata .
after finishing this letter [male] felt more composed ; he looked well around him to see if olivain and the host might not be watching him . whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper . a mute and touching caress , which the heart of [male] might well divine on opening the letter . during this time olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie . the horses were also refreshed , [male] motioned to the host to approach .
if you can make her , you have more influence than i , ', said michel . [female] never sits , and never eats . and never drinks , she was standing now close behind her uncle with both her hands upon his head . and she would often stand so after the supper was commenced , only moving to attend upon him . or to supplement the services of [female] and the maid servant when she perceived that they were becoming for a time inadequate to their duties .
when mrs. [female] saw [female] in the middle of that day . she could hardly give him much encouragement . and yet she felt by no means sure that he might not succeed even yet . [female] had been very positive in her answers , and yet there had been something . either in her words or in the tone of her voice .
but even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he knew or a stranger . so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that moment . moreover , just as [male] was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was suddenly heard from both sides . the corporal frowned at [male] 's words and , uttering some meaningless oaths . slammed the door , the shed became semidark , and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned the sick man 's groans .
they had held their own , if even with an effort , and had not sold a rood of it for the last hundred years or so . but they were not an adventurous race , they never traded . or speculated , or tried agricultural improvements of any kind , they had no capital in any bank . nor what perhaps would have been more in character , hoards of gold in any stocking . their mode of life was simple , and more like that of yeomen than squires .
finding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels . his squire 's as well as his own , [male] considered that it would be advisable to continue the journey he had begun . and bring to a close that great adventure for which he had been called and chosen . and with this high resolve he went and knelt before [male] . who , however , would not allow him to utter a word until he had risen .
mer , here 's a petition from the associated wine merchants of mytilene ? are there no grapes this year ? thes . well . what 's wrong with the associated wine merchants of mytilene ? are there no grapes this year ? mer . there are plenty of grapes . only they are full of ginger beer .
i am becoming anxious to know the count , he is the most intimate friend of [male] 's husband . and in that capacity he excites my strongest interest . neither [male] nor i have ever seen him . all i know of him is that his accidental presence , years ago . on the steps of the trinita [male] monte at [male] .
she had been struck with something blunt and heavy . on the head and spine ; after the blows were dealt . something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence , as she lay on her face . and on the ground beside her , when [female] picked her up . was a convict 's leg iron which had been filed asunder .
the place was remarkably quiet -- no footsteps went up or down the stairs . she only heard in the room beneath her a dull . rumbling sound of men 's voices talking . before she had been long left alone the count returned , to explain that miss [female] was then taking rest . and could not be [male] for a little while , he was accompanied into the room by a gentleman .
he could not speak , he dared not even look at her . but rode with his eyes fixed upon the ground . where the sunlight fell in long bars of gold . sammy , too , was silent , she felt something that was strangely like fear . when she found herself alone with her big neighbor .
you may see for yourself one of these playbills in the carnavalet museum . it details the players by their stage names only . with the exception of [male] binet and his daughter . and leaving out of account that he who plays trivelin in one piece appears as tabarin in another . it makes the company appear to be at least half as numerous again as it really was .
by and by an elderly jew came in , and dinner had reached the stage of peppery mutton ragout . when the door opened again , victoria 's place was almost opposite . and involuntarily , she glanced up , the handsome arab who had crossed from marseilles on the boat saluted her with grave courtesy as he met her look . and passed on , casting down his eyes , he was shown to a table at some distance . the manner of the arab waiter who conducted him being so impressive .
why was that fore carriage of a truck in that place in the street ? in the first place , to encumber the street ; next , in order that it might finish the process of rusting . there is a throng of institutions in the old social order . which one comes across in this fashion as one walks about outdoors . and which have no other reasons for existence than the above .
it was impossible to give battle before information had been collected . the wounded gathered in , the supplies of ammunition replenished . the slain reckoned up , new officers appointed to replace those who had been killed . and before the men had had food and sleep . and meanwhile , the very next morning after the battle , the french army advanced of itself upon the russians .
they talked of the florentine , the roman . the cosmopolite world , and might have been distinguished performers figuring for a charity . it all had the rich readiness that would have come from rehearsal . madame [female] appealed to her as if she had been on the stage . but she could ignore any learnt cue without spoiling the scene .
to soames she was a puzzle , he was almost deceived by this careless gaiety . almost -- because he did not fail to mark her eyes often fixed on nothing . and the film of light shining from her bedroom window late at night . what was she thinking and brooding over into small hours when she ought to have been asleep ? but he dared not ask what was in her mind ; and , since that one little talk in the billiard room .
not many weeks afterwards we went to live at longfield . which henceforth became the family home for many years . yet how shall i describe it -- the familiar spot . so familiar that it seems to need no description at all , it was but a small place when we first came there . it led out of the high road by a field gate .
the templar would have made an angry reply , but was interrupted by the prior . who again expressed his astonishment , that their guide , after such long absence . should be so perfectly acquainted with the passes of the forest , rotherwood was not . however , without defences ; no habitation , in that [male] period . could have been so , without the risk of being plundered and burnt before the next morning .
the fog was thick in bloomsbury , and when he got out of the cab he was taken with a fit of coughing . and had to cling to the railings , she had to pay the cab . and it took some time to find the money . would no one open the door ? she was surprised to see him make his way up the steps to the bell . and having got her change , she followed him into the house .
presently the road took a turn and a sight was revealed that did not tend to improve his already irritable mood . just here the roadway was bordered by a deep bank covered with trees which sloped down to the valley of the [organization] . at this time of the year looking its loveliest in the soft autumn lights . and here , seated on a bank of turf beneath the shadow of a yellowing chestnut tree . in such position as to get a view of [location] and flashing river where cattle red and white stood chewing the still luxuriant aftermath .
the tone , the look , with which `` thank god ! '' was uttered by captain wentworth , [female] was sure could never be forgotten by her . nor the sight of him afterwards . as he sat near a table , leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed . as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul , and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them .
in the gloom , with foreboding eating at her heart , yellow bird 's red lips parted in a smile as those days came back to her . for they were pleasing days to think about , but after that the years sped swiftly in her mind until the day when the little boy . a man grown -- came to save her tribe . and her own life , and the life of sun cloud . and of slim buck her husband , since then prosperity and happiness had been her lot .
at this offer of resistance , from all about him in the covert of the woods there went up the sound of laughter . a score of men , at least , for this was the very thickest of the ambush . joined in this cruel and untimely mirth , then an arrow glanced over selden 's shoulder . and he leaped and ran a little back , another dart struck quivering at his heel . he made for the cover , a third shaft leaped out right in his face .
[male] 's fancy is akin to the flight of the birds that are his special loves . it never seems to have entered a house , but since birth to have been roaming the air . in rain and sun , or visiting the trees and the grass . i not only disbelieve utterly , but intensely dislike , the doctrine of metempsychosis . which , if i understand it aright , seems the negation of the creative impulse .
their parents then loaded me with attentions . there was an enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness , and in repaying it by a consideration . a scrupulous regard to their feelings -- to which they were not . perhaps , at all times accustomed , and which both charmed and benefited them ; because , while it elevated them in their own eyes . it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received .
he was still afraid , the mind that had poured its memories into that crystal lens had been dead a million years . but neither time nor death had dulled the terror that beset ban cruach in his journey through that nightmare pass . he looked into the [male] and narrow mouth of the gates of death . cleaving the scarp like a wound , and the primitive ape thing within him cringed and moaned . oppressed with a sudden sense of fate , he had come painfully across half a world .
let it be said to nuflo 's credit that he objected to this ceremony . arguing that she could not be a saint , with an aureole in token of her sainthood . yet stand in need of being baptized by a priest , a priest . he added , with a little chuckle of malicious pleasure . who was often seen drunk , who cheated at cards , and was sometimes suspected of putting poison on his fighting cock 's spur to make sure of the victory !
orders were [female] given , the unwilling pony was brought out of his bed of straw . and again equipped for service -- davie ( a leathern post bag strapped across his shoulders ) . was perched upon the saddle , with a tear in his eye . and a switch in his hand , jock good naturedly led the animal out of town . and , by the crack of his whip , and the whoop and halloo of his too well-known voice .
he had considered many schemes for getting trace of her . among the most favored being that of finding the brakeman who stood on the end of the train that day among those who watched him ride and overtake it . and learning from him to what point her ticket read . that was the simplest plan , but he knew that conductors and brakemen changed every few hundred miles . and that this plan might not lead to anything in the end .
i was silly , foolish , quixotic to hope that here , in this little world of workaday people . he might be brought to see that personal acquisition and advance is not enough to give life meaning . to justify what it exacts , i was foolish , we are more apart than when i came . mrs. [female] , in her blue cotton dress . a band of embroidery in the neck of its close fitting basque .
we shall not strive , said [male] le fay . that was king [male] 's sister . i shall put an enchantment upon him that he shall not awake in six hours . and then i will lead him away unto my castle , and when he is surely within my hold . i shall take the enchantment from him , and then let him choose which of [male] he will have unto paramour .
`` it comes from [female] , '' said mrs. [female] . giving her the letter , mr. [male] presents his compliments to miss [female] . and begs to know whether he may be permitted to call at [male] tomorrow after two and to see her alone . mr. [male] has just returned from [male] . where he had hoped to find miss [female] , mrs. [female] read .
how should they care ? now there are ruins -- ruins , and the cobras slip in and out through the deserted holy places . they breed their writhing young in the sleeping chambers of queens . the tigers [male] in the moonlight . and the giant spider , more terrible than the cobra . strikes with its [male] poison claw and .
her color rose and fell almost with each beat of her heart . she saw the steadfast purpose in his eyes . and shrank from the decision she would be called upon to make . hardly realizing what form the words took , she gave faint utterance to the first lucid idea that presented itself . `` i think -- i must really -- go to my room , '' she murmured .
by the train of the same evening , i returned alone to dimchurch . having completely failed to achieve the purpose which taken me to the metropolis . [female] had appeared at the bank as soon as the doors were opened in the morning . had drawn out some hundreds of pounds in circular notes . had told the bankers that they should be furnished with an address at which they could write to him .
the grapnel was again lowered , its smart impact upon the distant water reached their ears like a kiss . whereupon yeobright knelt down , and leaning over the well began dragging the grapnel round and round as fairway had done . tie a rope round him . it is dangerous , cried a soft and anxious voice somewhere above them , everybody turned . the speaker was a woman , gazing down upon the group from an upper window .
he addressed an old jewish man in an ancient coat . long of skirt , and wide of pocket , a venerable man . bald and shining at the top of his head . and with long grey hair flowing down at its sides and mingling with his beard . a man who with a graceful eastern action of homage bent his head .
aura stopped suddenly , `` look there -- at arite , '' she said , pointing up at the horizon ahead of them . far in the distance , at the edge of the lake . and beside a dim smudge he knew to be the houses of arite . the very young man saw the giant figure of a man .
very little more was said , and half an hour after this interview , the police officer left [female] in a post chaise . on the first stage of the journey to murford haven , words are too weak to describe the sufferings of the mother of the lost child . and of the friends to whom she was hardly less dear , they waited very quietly . with all outward show of calmness , but the pain of suspense was not less keen . they sat silent , unoccupied , counting the hours .
i hurried through my bath , when i came out . i found bimal sitting on the floor outside , could this be my bimal of old . my proud , sensitive bimal ? what favour could she be wanting to beg . seated like this at my door ? as i stopped short , she stood up and said gently with downcast eyes . `` i would have a word with you . ''
at the touch of his hand , at the spontaneous approval of his first words . loder 's pride thrilled , and in a vehement rush of ambition his senses answered to the praise . then , as fraide in all unconsciousness added his second sentence . the hot glow of feeling suddenly chilled , in a sweep of intuitive reaction the meaning and the danger of his falsely real position extinguished his excitement and turned his triumph cold . with an involuntary gesture he withdrew his arm .
she might drag on for a time on sixteen pound . but such wages would drive her in the end into the workhouse . if it were not for the child , but she would never desert her [male] boy . who loved her so dearly , come what might , a sudden imagination let her see him playing in the little street . waiting for her to come home , and her love for him went to her head like madness .
when the reading was done , mrs. [female] told them a story of a young man who had shed his blood upon a scottish moor because he was too brave to be untrue to his lord . and then , in a few words , made them all see that still some conflict was being waged . and that there was still opportunity for each to display loyal courage and fidelity . after the worship was over , hughie seized his scotch bonnet and rushed for the jumper . and in a few minutes his mother had all the space not taken up by him and ranald packed with blankets and baskets .
the letter clerk seized a batch of correspondence and sorted it with nimble fingers . the form of the question told him that spencer was interested in letters stamped for the greater part with bland presentments of bygone presidents of [location] . in any event , he would have known , by long experience of the type . that the well dressed , straight limbed , strong faced young man on the other side of the counter was an american . he withdrew four missives from the bundle .
the heir presumptive , whose marriage with desplein 's only daughter had lately been arranged . bowed to the young girl without seeming struck , as his father had been . with her beauty , [female] was thus enabled to compare the youth of today with the old age of a past epoch . for the old prince [male] cadignan had already said a few words which made her feel that he rendered as true a homage to womanhood as to royalty . the duc [male] rhetore .
he listened , and it came again ; but in the middle of it . when the long , moaning grief of the voice was rising to its full despair . there broke in a sharp interruption -- a shrieking , yelping cry . such as a dog makes when it is suddenly struck , in another moment the forest thrilled with the deep throated pack call of the wolf who has started a fresh kill . hardly had its echoes died away when , from deeper in the swamp .
and new strength new work will meet ; till , at length . long rest is sweet , and now horse and rider had arrived near enough for me to see . fastened by the long neck to the hinder part of the saddle . and trailing its hideous length on the ground behind , the body of a great dragon . it was no wonder that , with such a drag at his heels .
the appointment was at the semiramis hotel , where sir [male] was staying . i went with my mind an aching void , and my heart a cold boiled potato . i can think of nothing more disagreeable , for not a word more would [male] let drop as to the great man 's business with [male] or the mountain of the golden pyramid . the eyes were wide apart , and kinder than in the photographs , they were even curiously innocent , and boyish . his grin of greeting made the large , waxed [male] moustache point joyously up .
at the next minute he went tearing down the stairs . and the kitchen rang with his laughter . she was not afraid , it was only an idea . only a possibility , only a dream of consequences . but at one bound it brought her so much nearer to [female] .
where did the difficulty lie ? not in their materials , alas ! nor in their ambitions , but in something more profound . in her own inaptitude , and above all , in her mother 's temperament . [location] would calculate that she had never known her write for more than ten minutes at a time . ideas came to her chiefly when she was in motion .
the force beam that sprang from it cut through the press of creatures fleeing before him . hampered by their own numbers as they crowded back through the archway . he had only a few short seconds to do what he had to do . rushing with great strides across the ice , spurning the withered bodies of the dead ... and then , from the glooming darkness that hovered around the tower of stone .
the air was crisp with the compelling tang of the sea . and the whole landscape was infused with the subtleties of a sea evening . a few dim sails drifted along the darkening . fir clad harbor shores , a bell was ringing from the tower of a little white church on the far side . mellowly and dreamily sweet , the chime floated across the water blent with the moan of the sea .
`` wait a bit , wait a bit , i know there are nineteen , '' said levin , counting a second time over the grouse and snipe . that looked so much less important now , bent and dry and bloodstained , with heads crooked aside . than they did when they were flying , the number was verified . and stepan arkadyevitch 's envy pleased levin .
to [female] this was adorable genuineness , and religious abstinence from that artificiality which uses up the soul in the efforts of pretence . for she looked as reverently at mr. [female] 's religious elevation above herself as she did at his intellect and learning . he assented to her expressions of devout feeling . and usually with an appropriate quotation ; he allowed himself to say that he had gone through some spiritual conflicts in his youth . in short , [female] saw that here she might reckon on understanding .
what are the causes of these disasters ? we do not know . could these societies have been saved ? was it their fault ? did they persist in the fatal vice which destroyed them ? what is the amount of suicide in these terrible deaths of a nation and a race ? questions to which there exists no reply , darkness enwraps condemned civilizations .
mr. [male] likewise encouraged [male] 's propensity to persecute the lower creation . both by precept and example , as he frequently came to course or shoot over his brother in law 's grounds . he would bring his favourite dogs with him . and he treated them so brutally that , poor as i was . i would have given a sovereign any day to see one of them bite him .
[female] , said [female] . sitting on the grass with his hands upon his knees . and the one star , i think it was [location] . shining down into his eyes , deepening them into that peculiar look . worth any so called handsome eyes ; -- [male] , i wonder how soon we shall have to rise up from this quiet .
after this the days passed with a dull monotony , the prisoner . seeing that no good was to be expected of it , dropped her bantering tone with the old people . no longer were her meals served to her at the pistol point . for hours together she would sit , a pathetic little figure . in the great arm chair which she had pulled into the embrasure of one of the windows .
and it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one 's own nothingness and immeasurable meanness . for [female] with the standard of good and evil given [female] by [female] . no human actions are incommensurable , and there is no greatness where simplicity . goodness , and truth are absent , what russian , reading the account of the last part of the campaign of 1812 . has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret , dissatisfaction , and perplexity ?
when , in sandip 's appeals , his worship of the country gets to be subtly interwoven with his worship of me . then does my blood dance , indeed , and the barriers of my hesitation totter . his talks about art and sex . his distinctions between real and unreal , had but clogged my attempts at response with some revolting nastiness . this , however , now burst again into a glow before which my repugnance faded away .
but all the world knew that he drank , he had taken by the throat a proctor 's bull dog when he had been drunk at oxford . had nearly strangled the man , and had been expelled , he had fallen through his violence into some terrible misfortune at [location] . had been brought before a public judge , and his name and his infamy had been made notorious in every newspaper in the two capitals . after that he had fought a ruffian at newmarket . and had really killed him with his fists , in reference to this latter affray it had been proved that the attack had been made on him .
mrs roper had been quite as good as her word when she told mrs eames that her household was composed of herself . of a son who was in an attorney 's office . of an ancient maiden [female] , named miss spruce . who lodged with her , and of mr cradell . the divine [male] had not then been living with her .
slowly and with infinite labour [organization] sifted the enormous volume of evidence that poured in upon it . proving conclusively that [female] dene had been seen in every part of [location] . not to mention a number of places on the continent . police officers swore and perspired as they strove to grapple with this enormous problem . night and day they worked with the frenzy of despair .
we made good time ; and a couple of hours before sunset we stood upon the high confines of the valley of holiness . and our eyes swept it from end to end and noted its features . that is , its large features , these were the three masses of buildings . they were distant and isolated temporalities shrunken to toy constructions in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert , and was . such a scene is always mournful , it is so impressively still , and looks so steeped in death .
it certainly was , [female] , as the disgusted [female] said . looked like a walking rag bag , it was impossible to say what his ground color was . his legs were white with [male] spots on them . his back was gray with a huge patch of yellow on one side and a [male] patch on the other . his tail was yellow with a gray tip , one ear was [male] and one yellow .
then , as the bell of the convent in the town boomed forth the hour of noon . sir gawaine heaved up his sword for a final blow . but his sword descended just as the last stroke of twelve had died away . and sir [male] marvelled to feel that what should have been so grievous a blow that . belike , he could not have stood before it .
it was curious to see him lying in the parlor of this alien residence . candles at his head and feet . burning sepulchrally , a silver cross upon his breast . caressed by his waxen fingers , he would have smiled if he could have seen himself . but the [male] family was too conventional , too set in its convictions .
it was not difficult to conquer , as she had hitherto done . men prompt to let themselves be seduced , and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net . [female] was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh . and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind . but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature .
`` ay , and my father put his arm out of joint to have time to go courting , '' said [male] , in an eclipsing tone , wiping his face with his shirt sleeve and thrusting back his hat upon the nape of his neck . by this time cainy was nearing the group of harvesters . and was perceived to be carrying a large slice of bread and ham in one hand . from which he took mouthfuls as he ran , the other being wrapped in a bandage .
having taken this survey , he executed a movement like that of a man who has made up his mind . strode to his alcove , grasped his knapsack . opened it , fumbled in it , pulled out of it something which he placed on the bed . put his shoes into one of his pockets , shut the whole thing up again . threw the knapsack on his shoulders , put on his cap .
i did not hear him re enter , and in the morning i found he was still away . we were in april then : the weather was sweet and warm , the grass as green as showers and sun could make it . and the two dwarf apple trees near the southern wall in full bloom . after breakfast , [female] insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my work under the fir trees at the end of the house . and she beguiled hareton , who had perfectly recovered from his accident .
`` not if you think she will not be back till late , '' adding , as if suddenly aware of some discourtesy in his speech . `` and i should miss the pleasure of walking home with you . '' edna locked the door and put the key back in its hiding place . they went together , picking their way across muddy streets and sidewalks encumbered with the cheap display of small tradesmen . part of the distance they rode in the car .
as soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory . then he began to imagine that the russians were running away and that he himself was killed . but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy . as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away . he again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle .
`` i will not remain in the room with you to be insulted thus , '' said mrs. [female] , and she did not remain . but left the chamber , slamming the door after her as she went . `` it will be better that she should go , '' said [male] . when he found himself alone , and so it came to pass that that blessing of a rich marriage .
but something might turn up ; and it was devoutly to be hoped that [male] would take a long time over his inquiry . the assizes might come on as soon as it was terminated , or very shortly afterwards . and then everything might be well , `` you wo not find [male] very ready at it , '' said mr. [male] , the bishop in his heart was comforted by the words . `` but he must be made to be ready to do his duty , '' said mrs. [female] , imperiously .
he had spent much money and had apparently made none . and had been , as all his friends declared , on the high road to ruin . aunt macleod had taken her judgement from this period of his life when she had spoken of him as a man who never did anything . but he had come forth again suddenly as a working man ; and now they who professed to know . declared that he was by no means poor , he was in the city every day .
for my own part i felt that i never wished to see or hear of food again . the silent journey home , added to the events of the day . had brought on one of my ugly morbid moods , we were seated at the breakfast table . dicky and i , the morning after our trip to marvin . from which i had returned weary of body and sick of mind .
mrs [female] 's shop parlour had been decorated under her own eye . and presented , on the side towards the shop , a little fiction in which mrs [female] unspeakably rejoiced . this poetical heightening of the parlour consisted in the wall being painted to represent the exterior of a thatched cottage . the artist having introduced ( in as effective a manner as he found compatible with their highly disproportionate dimensions ) . the real door and window , the modest sunflower and hollyhock were depicted as flourishing with great luxuriance on this rustic dwelling .
not wanting to talk about myself ( though very fond of doing so , when time and season favour ) . i led her back to that fearful night of the day when first i had seen her . she was not desirous to speak of it , because of her own little children . however , i drew her gradually to recollection of lorna . and then of the little boy who died , and the poor mother buried with him .
[male] has , also , a reputation for reckless carrying on of sail . i overheard henderson and another of the hunters , [male] , a californian . talking about it , two years ago he dismasted the ghost in a gale on bering sea . whereupon the present masts were put in , which are stronger and heavier in every way . he is said to have remarked , when he put them in .
[male] crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards . five minutes after the door had been closed on [female] 's entrance . it was again opened for the count , [female] was at the entrance of the garden . where she was attentively watching penelon , who , entering with zeal into his profession of gardener . was very busy grafting some bengal roses , `` ah , count , '' she exclaimed .
all the feminine hearts except [male] 's were beating fast with anxiety . thinking [male] terrific as he sat with his listening frown on . and only daring to look at him furtively , if he did say anything severe it would be so hard for them all . they could only comfort themselves with thinking that prince [male] . who had heard the finest things , preferred [female] 's singing to any other .
twenty minutes to walk a mile . or thirty minutes in desert sand . forty minutes to make inquiries ; surely it need not take longer ! and thirty minutes back , but an hour and a half dragged on . before there was any sign of the absentee ; then at last , [female] 's eye .
but to night was to be a kind of gala , on account of the young man from the country . so there was a lobster and a heap of lettuces . very little lobster in proportion to the green stuff . and sigismund was to make a salad , he was very proud of his skill in this department of culinary art . and as he was generally about five and twenty minutes chopping , and sprinkling .
[female] , poor [female] ! those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of . and which constituted the real misery of the business to her , [female] had behaved very ill by herself . very ill in many ways , -- but it was not so much his behaviour as her own . which made her so angry with him , it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on [male] 's account .
all looked extremely clean and glittering , but the general effect would have been somewhat chilling had not a second large pair of folding doors . standing wide open , and disclosing another and smaller salon , more snugly furnished , offered some relief to the eye . this room was carpeted , and therein was a piano . a couch , a chiffonniere -- above all , it contained a lofty window with a crimson curtain . which , being undrawn , afforded another glimpse of the garden , through the large .
she had scarcely uttered the words when the candlestick fell from her extended hand . and she stood rooted to the gravel pathway . a statue of fear , exactly opposite to her , slowly advancing towards the open door of the scullery . she saw an awful figure -- whose description was too familiar to her . there it was , the ghost -- the shadowy image of the man who had destroyed himself in that house .
mr. [male] kept his hands behind him and allowed her pliant arm to cling with difficulty against his rigid arm . there was something horrible to [female] in the sensation which this unresponsive hardness inflicted on her . that is a strong word , but not too strong : it is in these acts called trivialities that the seeds of joy are forever wasted . until men and women look round with haggard faces at the devastation their own waste has made . and say , the earth bears no harvest of sweetness .
he believed almost with devoutness in the plot which he had detected for the spoliation of lord wetherby 's summer house . that plot of which he held lord dawlish to be the mainspring . and it must be admitted that circumstances had combined to help his belief . if the atmosphere in which he was moving was not sinister then there was no meaning in the word . summer homes had been burgled , there was no getting away from that -- half a dozen at least in the past two months .
the reddleman lived like a gipsy ; but gipsies he scorned . he was about as thriving as travelling basket and mat makers . but he had nothing to do with them . he was more decently born and brought up than the cattledrovers who passed and repassed him in his wanderings . but they merely nodded to him , his stock was more valuable than that of pedlars .
a negro appeared , switched on a string of small lights under the awning . and began setting the wicker table for supper . and while they ate cold sliced chicken , salad , artichokes and [male] jam from the plentiful larder below . [male] began to talk , hesitatingly at first , but eagerly as he saw she was interested . [female] scarcely touched her food as she watched his dark young face .
the quadrangle below was very beautiful , with its walls of rugged grey . its cloisters , its grass carpet . but to her it was of no more interest than if it had been the rattling court yard to one of those hotels in which she spent her life . she saw it , but heeded it not . she seemed to be thinking of herself , or of something she desired .
no unusual incident marked his departure , the last they saw of him he was calmly sitting on the ring near the scratch . then passed the slow days of watching , each taking his turn for the allotted six hours . by the fifth day , they began to hourly expect the chemist . but it passed through its weary length , and he did not come . the sixth day dragged by , and then came the last -- the day he had promised would end their watching .
i saw his eyes flash golden as he spoke . and i saw the terror mount in her own . it was i who was now favoured by a quick look . he was wondering if i were making fun of him . i put three or four spokes over to counteract a sheer toward the wind on the part of the ghost .
i told her that it was no trifle . but a most important thing , to abandon wealth , and honour . and the brilliance of high life , and be despised by every one for such abundant folly . moreover , that i should appear a knave for taking advantage of her youth . and boundless generosity , and ruining a noble maid by my selfishness .
but for a farmer , like [male] , for example . whose fallows were not well cleaned , who did not know the rudiments of hedging and ditching . and showed but a small share of judgment in the purchase of winter stock . [male] was as hard and implacable as the north east wind , [male] could not make a remark . even on the weather , but [male] detected in it a taint of that unsoundness and general ignorance which was palpable in all his farming operations .
lady malice was herself afraid of her husband . there is many a woman , otherwise courageous enough , who will rather endure the worst and most degrading . than encounter articulate insult . the mere lack of conscience gives the scoundrel advantage incalculable over the honest man . the lack of refinement gives a similar advantage to the cad over the gentleman .
this behaviour might have had a disquieting effect on me had i not been thoroughly convinced that his fears were purely superstitious and that there could be no dangerous animal in a spot i was accustomed to walk in every day . my plan was to ramble about with an unconcerned air , occasionally pointing out an uncommon tree or shrub or vine . or calling his attention to a distant bird cry and asking the bird 's name . in the hope that the mysterious voice would make itself heard and that he would be able to give me some explanation of it . but for upwards of two hours we moved about .
mrs. [female] met me in the passage on the first floor . and pointed out oscar 's room , i found him walking backwards and forwards restlessly . the first words he said alluded to his brother 's letter . i had arranged not to disturb him by any reference to that painful matter until the next morning . and i tried to change the topic , it was useless , there was an anxiety in his mind which was not to be dismissed at will .
reduced to its essence , it is but the vigil of searching criticism . but it throws the action further forward that twenty `` incidents '' might have done . it was designed to have all the vivacity of incidents and all the economy of picture . she sits up , by her dying fire . far into the night , under the spell of recognitions on which she finds the last sharpness suddenly wait .
it was their intention that mr. [male] 's case should not be allowed to sleep . one of these gentlemen made a distinct offer to [male] finn of unbounded popularity during life and of immortality afterwards . if he , as a member of parliament . would take up [male] 's case with vigour . [male] , not quite understanding the nature of the offer .
well , if it were not so , who could sleep at nights ? the burden laid on queen flavia i knew . and know , so well as a man can know it , i think it needs a woman to know it fully . for even now my wife 's eyes fill with tears when we speak of it . yet she bore it , and if she failed in anything . i wonder that it was in so little , for it was not only that she had never loved the king and had loved another with all her heart .
bannon quietly stepped to one side , the girl looked up for a moment and brushed her hair back from her face . the fellow spoke again in a low tone , but beyond a slight compressing of her lips she did not seem to hear him . without a word , bannon came forward , took him by the arm . and led him out of the door , still holding his arm . he took a step back , and ( they stood in the outer circle of the electric light ) .
the consequence was , that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days . the fourth was sunday , and i brought it into her room after the family were gone to church . there was a manservant left to keep the house with me . and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service . but on that occasion the weather was so warm and [male] that i set them wide open .
wherever they moved a strong singing followed them underground . but this night there was no panic , all the land was empty except for themselves . and at the last ( they were sitting by the lamp post hand in hand ) . she turned and kissed him , he woke with a start . staring at the waving curtain of the cabin door ; he could almost have sworn that the kiss was real .
he was immensely pleased by [location] 's praise of his brothers and sisters . he would have liked to go on telling her about them , but he checked himself . a little dry chirp from the corner of the room now roused her attention . `` my tame rook , '' he explained briefly . `` a cat had bitten one of its legs , '' she looked at the rook .
nor was the purchase of an annuity a transaction which he was inclined to accomplish . it was a pleasing notion certainly , that idea of concentrating all his hoarded money upon the remaining years of his life . retiring from the toils of agriculture , and giving himself up for the rest of his days to an existence of luxurious idleness . but , on the other hand , it would be a bitter thing to surrender his fondly loved money for the poor return of an income . to deprive himself of all opportunity of speculating and increasing his store .
[female] will not rest without having the world at her feet , said miss [female] , the meek governess : hyperbolical words which have long come to carry the most moderate meanings . for who has not heard of private persons having the world at their feet in the shape of some half dozen items of flattering regard generally known in a genteel suburb ? and words could hardly be too wide or vague to indicate the prospect that made a hazy largeness about poor [female] on the heights of her young self exultation . other people allowed themselves to be made slaves of .
[male] was apt to be fooled himself , he had not yet learned to keep away from the shell game wagons that followed the circus . after supper [male] put on a necktie and went across the fields to court [female] . and [female] and oscar sat down to a game of checkers . while alexandra read `` the swiss family robinson '' aloud to her mother and emil . it was not long before the two boys at the table neglected their game to listen .
to look at them crawling about on deck or in the rigging is enough . they are truly weak , they are gaunt cheeked and haggard gray of skin . with great dark circles under their eyes , the predicted plague of sea boils and sea cuts has come . and their hands and wrists and arms are frightfully afflicted . now one , and now another , and sometimes several , either from being knocked down by seas or from general miserableness .
that is to say , they had never quarrelled , a very liberal allowance had been made to the nephew . but the two relatives had no tastes in common , and did not often meet . once a year mr [male] visited the duke at his great country seat for two or three days . and usually dined with him two or three times during the season in [location] . mr [male] sat for a borough which was absolutely under the duke 's command .
lambert turned , contempt in his courageous bearing . and walked out of the place , scorning to throw a glance behind to see whether [male] came after him . or whether he laid hand to his weapon in the treachery that [male] had read in his eyes . [male] left his horse at the saloon hitching rack while he went to the store . business was brisk in that place , also , requiring a wait of half an hour before his turn came .
suddenly , [female] remembered something about a gate opening into the rue scribe . an underground passage running straight to the rue scribe from the lake ... yes , christine had told him about that ... and , when he found that the key was no longer in the box . he nevertheless ran to the rue scribe . outside , in the street , he passed his trembling hands over the huge stones .
in the days of his childhood and youth . mr. [male] had been accustomed to poverty . but it was honest , decent poverty ; not the grinding squalid misery he had remarked in every part of [male] house . and which contrasted strangely with the pompous sumptuousness of the room in which he now sat . unaccustomed wonder filled his mind at the reflection of the different lots of the brethren of mankind .
although [location] had just disclaimed any knowledge of literature . she listened attentively , at least , she listened to the first twenty five lines attentively . and then she frowned , her attention was only aroused again when rodney raised his finger . a sign , she knew , that the meter was about to change . his theory was that every mood has its meter .
to be granite and to doubt , to be the statue of chastisement cast in one piece in the mould of the law . and suddenly to become aware of the fact that one cherishes beneath one 's breast of bronze something absurd and disobedient which almost resembles a heart ! to come to the pass of returning good for good , although one has said to oneself up to that day that that good is evil ! to be the watch dog , and to lick the intruder 's hand , to be ice and melt ! to be the pincers and to turn into a hand , to suddenly feel one 's fingers opening !
on the third day i discovered the fatal spot , and knew that never again would i behold rima in the flesh . that my last hope had indeed been a vain one , there could be no mistake . just such an open place as the indian had pictured to me was here , with giant trees standing apart . while one tree stood killed and blackened by fire , surrounded by a huge heap . sixty or seventy yards across .
she shook with the sobs that come so convulsively when an old person weeps . the silence around her struck her at last ; and she quieted herself to listen , no sound , she looked . her son sate by the table . his arms thrown half across it . his head bent face downwards .
signor pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor . which he offered at the low charge of a [male] per diem . they accepted his offer ; but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left . [male] started for naples , as for franz . he remained at [male] , and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the cascine .
[female] entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from barton . and not thirty from combe magna ; and before she had been five minutes within its walls . while the others were busily helping [female] to show her child to the housekeeper . she quitted it again , stealing away through the winding shrubberies . now just beginning to be in beauty , to gain a distant eminence ; where , from its grecian temple .
katherina , love me or love me not . i like the cap ; and it i will have . or i will have none , tailor . you bid me make it orderly and well . according to the fashion and the time , petruchio . marry , and did . but if you be remember would , i did not bid you [male] it to the time .
there was a strange mixture of acting and reality in this passion . she kept hold of her purpose as a child might tighten its hand over a small stolen thing . crying and denying all the while , even [female] was wrought upon by surprise . this capricious wish , this childish violence , was as unlike [female] 's bearing as it was incongruous with her person . both had always had a stamp of dignity on them .
his own eyes lost themselves in these depths . he saw himself in miniature down to the shoulders . with his handkerchief round his head and the top of his shirt open , he rose . she came to the window to see him off . and stayed leaning on the sill between two pots of geranium .
the reason was a good one , so far as it went , his influence over her had been so marked that she had caught his manner and habits . his speech and phrases , his likings and his aversions . and to leave her in farmland would be to let her slip back again out of accord with him . he wished to have her under his charge for another reason . his parents had naturally desired to see her once at least before he carried her off to a distant settlement .
i sent little ensie to blundell 's school , at my own cost and charges . having changed his name , for fear of what anyone might do to him . i called him ensie [male] . and we got him a commission . and after many scrapes of spirit , he did great things in the low countries .
if i opened limmeridge house as an asylum to lady [male] . what security had i against sir [male] 's following her here in a state of violent resentment against me for harbouring his wife ? i saw such a perfect labyrinth of troubles involved in this proceeding that i determined to feel my ground . as it were , i wrote , therefore , to dear [female] to beg ( as she had no husband to lay claim to her ) . that she would come here by herself , first , and talk the matter over with me .
just as incontestably as it was necessary to repay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition that his son . when he received it as a heritage . would say `` thank you '' to his father as levin had said `` thank you '' to his grandfather for all he built and planted , and to do this it was necessary to look after the land himself . not to let it , and to breed cattle , manure the fields .
he dismounted , and some of his attendants doing the same , followed their lord down the cliffs . treading lightly , lest their steps should betray them , immediately upon their reaching the bottom . they were perceived by the lady , who fled among the rocks . and was presently pursued by the duke 's people , the cavalier had no time to escape . but drew his sword , and defended himself against the furious assault of the duke .
and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by [male] . whilst [male] was making his way to [male] 's tent . [male] and [male] had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle . it would be impossible to describe [male] 's astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching . followed by a sergeant with a dozen men .
it was not to be expected that a man who was petted at sebright 's should carry himself in the allington drawing room as would [male] . who had never been petted by any one but his mother , and this fraction of a hero of ours had other advantages to back him . over and beyond those which fashion had given him , he was a tall . well looking man , with [male] eyes and an expressive mouth . a man whom you would probably observe in whatever room you might meet him .
since [male] left [location] in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the rostovs . he had been in [location] several times . and had passed near [location] , but had never been to see them , sometimes it occurred to [male] that he did not wish to see her . and this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke of him . `` nowadays old friends are not remembered , '' the countess would say when [male] was mentioned .
jane had never looked better than she did on this march day . standing on the summit of the great pyramid , strong , brown , and well knit . a reliable mind in a capable body , the undeniable plainness of her face redeemed by its kindly expression of interest and enjoyment . her wide , [female] smile revealing her fine white teeth . witnesses to her perfect soundness and health .
he was torn by contending passions , and opposite resolutions . now he resolved to expiate her guilt with her blood . and now he melted in all the softness of love . vengeance and honor bade him strike to the heart which had betrayed him . and urged him instantly to the deed -- when the idea of her beauty .
but his bitterness was not chiefly against [male] , that [male] had been very foolish he could not but acknowledge . but it was a kind of folly for which the doctor was able to find excuse . for lady [male] 's cold propriety he could find no excuse . with the squire he had spoken no word on the subject up to this period of which we are now writing . with her ladyship he had never spoken on it since that day when she had told him that [male] was to come no more to greshamsbury .
it was olivia [female] , in the mourning robes that she had worn . with but one brief intermission , ever since her husband 's death . her profile was turned towards the door by which [female] arundel entered the room . her eyes were bent steadily upon the low heap of burning ashes in the grate . even in that doubtful light the young man could see that her features were sharpened .
at camp sometimes when all the men were away and his own work was done . he would crouch like a raccoon in the far corner of his deep square bunk with the board ends that made of it a sort of little cabin . and play to himself softly on his violin , no one ever heard him . after supper he was docilely ready to fiddle to the men 's dancing . always then he gradually worked himself to a certain pitch of excitement .
still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered the dam . the pond , and the bank , on the pratzen heights . where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand . lay prince [male] bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle . piteous , and childlike moan , toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still .
to the end of the session , at any rate . mr finespun kept his position . and held the seals of the exchequer while all the quidnuncs of the nation . shaking their heads , spoke of the wonderful power of mr finespun . and declared that lord brock did not dare to face the opposition without him .
the day was cool and rather lustreless ; the first note of autumn had been struck . and the watery [female] rested on the walls in blurred and desultory gleams . washing them , as it were , in places tenderly chosen . where the ache of antiquity was keenest , her host 's brother . the vicar , had come to luncheon , and [male] had had five minutes
the ordonnance colors , quartered cross wise . violet and dead leaf , with a sprinkling of golden fleurs de lis . left the white-colored flag , with its fleur de lised cross , to dominate the whole . musketeers at the wings , with their forked sticks and their muskets on their shoulders . pikemen in the center , with their lances .
giving her pledges , he swears to her that he will always live on peaceful terms with her . and will make good to her all the loss which she can prove , and will build up again the houses which he had destroyed . when these things were agreed upon in accordance with the lady 's wish . my lord yvain asked leave to depart , but she would not have granted him this permission had he been willing to take her as his [female] . or to marry her , but he would not allow himself to be followed or escorted a single step .
it was even more than a probability , it was a grim necessity . to let him live and escape would be fatal to [male] , from back of these convictions . riding over them as if to demoralize any coherence and logic that might go with the evidence he was building up . came question after question , pounding at him one after the other . until his mind became more than ever a whirling chaos of uncertainty .
at the end of the fifteenth century , the formidable gibbet which dated from 1328 . was already very much dilapidated ; the beams were wormeaten , the chains rusted , the pillars green with mould . the layers of hewn stone were all cracked at their joints . and grass was growing on that platform which no feet touched . the monument made a horrible profile against the sky .
for i believe he 's one o those gentlemen as wishes to do the right thing . and to leave the world a bit better than he found it . which it 's my belief every man may do . whether he 's gentle or simple , whether he sets a good bit o work going and finds the money , or whether he does the work with his own hands .
this dialogue merged grotesquely into his mind 's most familiar state . a grotesque blending of desires , worries , exterior impressions and physical reactions . the street numbers of riverside drive were obscured by the mist and dripping trees from anything but the swiftest scrutiny . but amory had finally caught sight of one -- one hundred and twenty seventh street . he got off and with no distinct destination followed a winding .
several churches of different denominations are open , and divine service is performed in them unhindered . your fellow citizens are returning every day to their homes and orders have been given that they should find in them the help and protection due to their misfortunes . these are the measures the government has adopted to re establish order and relieve your condition . but to achieve this aim it is necessary that you should add your efforts and should . if possible , forget the misfortunes you have suffered , should entertain the hope of a less cruel fate .
[male] removed his clinging garments and hurried into a new suit . he was in no mood for conversation . and [male] 's [male] curiosity jarred upon him . happily , at this point , a sudden shivering of the floor and a creaking of woodwork proclaimed the fact that the vessel was under way again . and his [male] , turning pea green , rolled over on his side with a hollow moan .
peter 's heart was thumping rapidly as he took a step toward the deeper shadows . he swallowed hard , as if to clear a knot out of his scrawny throat . but he had made up his mind , something was compelling him . and he would go in , slowly the gloom engulfed him . and once again the whimsical spirit of fatalism had chosen a trivial thing to work out its ends in the romance and tragedy of human lives .
but sir mordred , the fifth of the brethren . sons of the queen of orkney . the which had mocked the good [male] when first he came to the court . and who had ever been jealous and ready to think evil of another , joined with sir agravaine . therewithal they three , sir gawaine .
then he put the open knife in his coat pocket . took out his pocket flash , and tiptoed around the room , there was nothing here he could use . the dining room had never been included in his plans for the town was too small to permit disposing of silver . as a matter of fact his plans were of the vaguest . he had found that with a mind like his , lucrative in intelligence .
at the approach of night they had all vanished away with their din and smoke . then the old bird plumed his feathers , at last he had understood ! with a flap of his great , [male] wings he shot downward . circling toward the plain , a man was picking his way across the plain . he was dressed in the garb of a clergyman .
how was she to bear the change ? -- it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them . but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs. [female] . only half a mile from them , and a miss [female] in the house . and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude . she dearly loved her father .
she was upon her knees in front of the little bookcase . a blinding film burned in her eyes . she caught her breath . struggling hard to master herself before she faced her father again . for a moment the factor went into his room .
in the meantime , having , in the flush of marriage completed his theological thesis and sent it off to the university from which he expected a doctor 's degree . he determined to enjoy the sporting possibilities of roscarna to the full . his shooting took him far afield , and he saw very little of gabrielle in the daytime . he kept away deliberately , for her condition made her strange and irritable at times . and he did not consider that devotion to her in a difficulty for which he had not been responsible was part of his contract .
that pleased me , too , and i wished i had some one with me to enjoy this artless little show of the new year . i had not really wanted [male] ; the companions i needed were [male] and [male] . [male] would have talked , as he loved to do when he looked at leisure on a broad valley . about ideas which he had to exclude from his ordinary hours lest they should break the power of business over his mind . and [female] would have gravely watched the argument from the shadow of her broad hat to see that it kept true .
olivia , o , sir , i will not be so hard hearted . i will give out divers schedules of my beauty . it shall be inventoried , and every particle and [male] would to my will . as , item , two lips , indifferent red ; item , two grey eyes . with lids to them ; item , one neck .
and if this had been the case in those early days , imagine what she felt now . when -- ah , well , -- when her friendship had had time and opportunity to become a much deeper sentiment . must it be confessed that she had seen mr. [male] even oftener than [location] and miss [female] knew of ? of course it had all been quite accidental ; but it had happened that now and then . when she had been taking a quiet walk in the lanes about oldclough .
these were the results of my interview with mrs. [female] . these were the various considerations , all steadily converging to one point , which decided the course of my proceedings on the next day . the morning was cloudy and lowering . but no rain fell , i left my bag at the hotel to wait there till i called for it . and , after inquiring the way , set forth on foot for old welmingham church .
and i thanked all the stars on [male] 's tent flag that none of the set understood arabic . no sight could have been more beautiful in our eyes than that village of white tents in the waste of yellow sand . our wildest imaginings could have pictured nothing more perfect , more peaceful , tea was ready . in the huge dining tent , where folding chairs were grouped round a white covered table . the floor of sand was hidden with thick , bright coloured rugs .
i went on with my sewing as long as i could see , and then bade [female] good evening . checking her too lively gratitude by the undeniable assurance that i had only done for her what she would have done for me . if she had been in my place and i in hers . i hastened back to horton lodge . where , having entered the schoolroom , i found the tea table all in confusion .
some said the lady had gone off with the stranger , and that there had been a clandestine marriage . which afterwards turned out to be no marriage at all ; others , that the stranger suddenly took himself off . and was no more seen by the young lady ; others that he owned at last to having another wife . and so on , the stranger was very well known to be one mr. [male] . belonging to another public office ; and there were circumstances in his life .
perhaps he referred to the circumstance of his bringing miss silver into our house . perhaps to his own blindness , or want of parental caution . in throwing the young people continually together , however , [male] was not one to lament over things inevitable . or by overweening blame of his own want of foresight . to imply a doubt of the foreseeing of providence .
he suffered a week to elapse , and then one day . in the morning , at an hour at which she rarely saw him . he strolled into the back parlour , he had watched his time . and he found her alone , she was sitting with some work . and he came and stood in front of her , he was going out .
`` go away , sir , this moment , and do not contaminate my room an instant longer by your presence , '' said the dragon , who had observed through the window that the bull's eye was still in full force before the house . then [male] withdrew , and descending into the hall made his way in the dark to the front door . for aught he knew there might still be treachery in regard to the lock . but his heart was comforted as he heard the footfall of the policeman on the door step .
the comte [female] lamothe . who , in 1815 , was an old man seventy five years of age . had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious air . his cold and angular face , his perfectly polished manners . his coat buttoned up to his cravat , and his long legs always crossed in long .
the doctor longed in his heart to pray to [male] to return with him . not to go and make further mischief ; not to do that which might cause a more bitter estrangement between himself and the squire . but he had not the courage to do it . he could not bring himself to accuse [male] of being in love with his niece . so after a few more senseless words on either side , words which each knew to be senseless as he uttered them .
i started to rush below to the flag locker , then remembered that in rigging the ghost . i had forgotten to make provision for a flag halyard , i looked at her . our eyes were not loath to meet , we leaned toward each other , and before i knew it my arms were about her . `` my man , '' she said , looking at me for an instant with tremulous lids which fluttered down and veiled her eyes as she snuggled her head against my breast with a happy little sigh . i looked toward the cutter , it was very close .
that humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a peculiar bitterness when her sister reminded her of it . she had not looked for such cruelty in her sister . and she was angry with her , but suddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt . and with it the sound of heart rending . smothered sobbing , and felt arms about her neck .
he put questions to himself . and made replies to himself , and his replies frightened him . he asked himself : what has that convict done . that desperate fellow , whom i have pursued even to persecution . and who has had me under his foot , and who could have avenged himself .
bulstrode 's native imperiousness and strength of determination served him well . this delicate looking man , himself nervously perturbed , found the needed stimulus in his strenuous circumstances . and through that difficult night and morning , while he had the air of an animated corpse returned to movement without warmth . holding the mastery by its chill impassibility his mind was intensely at work thinking of what he had to guard against and what would win him security . whatever prayers he might lift up , whatever statements he might inwardly make of this man 's wretched spiritual condition .
he had an idea of exchanging his graybridge practice for a better one by and by . and he used to talk to [female] of this ambitious design . but she took little interest in the subject . she had evinced very little interest in it from the first . and she displayed less now , what would be the use of such a change ?
after a moment his head cleared ; he felt better . then all at once he realized that the floor upon which he sat was moving . it seemed to be shifting out from under him in all directions . he sat with his feet flat upon the floor . his knees drawn close against his chin , and the floor seemed to be carrying his feet farther out .
the journey of lady [female] and her companion . the bow street officer , was as rapid as the journey of captain [male] . along the same northern road as that which he had travelled a few days before flew the post chaise containing the anguish stricken mother and her strange ally . in this hour of agony and suspense . [female] looked to the queer , wizened little police officer , [female] , as the best friend she had on earth .
she paused , breathless and pale . and walked rapidly along the terrace , as if to hide or control the agitation that possessed her . he leaned his head upon his hand . and sat so still mrs. [female] rejoined him , pale , but calm and self possessed . as she drew near , she marked his attitude .
there he found himself incapable of even the most petty routine work . he sat to his desk at eight o'clock and began the perusal of a sheaf of letters . comprising a certain correspondence , which [male] brought him . the first three he read carefully ; the following two rather hurriedly ; of the next one he seized only the salient and essential points . the seventh and eighth he skimmed ; the remainder of the bundle he thrust aside in uncontrollable impatience .
when they reached the offices of the law firm . mr. [male] , a short , fussy , albeit comfortable-looking little person , greeted all the members of the family and the various heirs and assigns with a hearty handshake . he had been personal counsel to [male] for twenty years . he knew his whims and idiosyncrasies . and considered himself very much in the light of a father confessor .
the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal . and the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the head . when seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror . substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes , but when it is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying . besides this horror at the extinction of life there is a severance .
he left me at the hotel door and hurried away toward the business part of the town . while i turned in the opposite direction , [male] 's confidence in his theory weighed upon me heavily . he was right in saying that it seemed the only tenable one , and yet . with the memory of miss [female] 's pure face before me . i could not believe it , i could not believe that those clear eyes sheltered such a secret .
her red , bushy hair hung in wisps about her face . after the greater part of it had been gathered into a tight knob at the back of her head . she was a martyr to the `` neuralagy , '' and suffered from a perennial cold in the head , which made it necessary for her to wear a cloud . which was only removed when it could be replaced by her nightcap , her face always bore the marks of her labors .
epidemic diseases , i believed , were often heralded by a gasping . sobbing , tormented , long lamenting east wind , hence , i inferred . arose the legend of the banshee , i fancied . too , i had noticed -- but was not philosopher enough to know whether there was any connection between the circumstances . that we often at the same time hear of [female] volcanic action in distant parts of the world .
the idea had first come to amherst on the winter afternoon when [female] westmore had confessed her love for him under the snow-laden trees of hopewood . even then the sense that his personal happiness was enlarged and secured by its promise of happiness to others had made him wish that the scene associated with the opening of his new life should be made to commemorate a corresponding change in the fortunes of westmore . but when the control of the mills passed into his hands other and more necessary improvements pressed upon him . and it was not till now that the financial condition of the company had permitted the execution of his plan . [female] , on her return to hanaford , had found the work already in progress .
she turned herself away from him . that he might no longer notice the mood which had set its sign so visibly upon her . and went indoors with a distressing sense of faintness and a beating brow . about an hour after , she heard the noise of the waggon and went out . still with a painful consciousness of her bewildered and troubled look , [male] , dressed in his best suit of clothes .
but , as he sat alone , during the small hours of the night . almost repenting of his sin with true repentance . he declared to himself that he did not care who might read them . they should , at any rate , be true , now they had been read by her to whom they had been addressed . and the daughter was standing before the mother to hear her doom .
by her uncle 's express advice , to achieve these results . and to secure a note of invitation which could be shown to lady [male] . were the objects of my visit to mr. [male] . when i have mentioned that this gentleman was equally feeble in mind and body . and that i let loose the whole force of my character on him .
`` you should not have done that , '' he said , he extended his cuff and added the words `` vitally important '' to what he had just written , it was probably that which decided her . ', [male] rose . his heart was light , he had never , of course . supposed that the girl was anything but perfect ; but it was nice to find his high opinion of her corroborated by one who had no reason to exhibit her in a favourable light . he understood her point of view and sympathised with it .
early the next morning mrs. arundel came from lawford grange with her confidential maid . and carried off her daughter in law and the baby . on the first stage of the journey into devonshire . before she left kemberling , [female] was told that no dead body had been found amongst the ruins of the towers . and this assertion deluded her into the belief that no unhappy creature had perished .
but in her present phase of life miss [female] suffered no misfortune of this kind . it had become a privilege to be allowed to attend upon miss [male] . and the feeling of this privilege had been enhanced by the manner in which lord [male] had devoted himself to her . fashion of course makes fashion . had not lord [male] been so very much struck by the charm of the young lady .
klesmer had really discerned [male] in the first moment of entering . but , with subtle politeness , he looked round bowingly at the three sisters as if he were uncertain which was the young lady in question . `` those are my daughters : this is miss [female] , '' said mrs. [female] . waving her hand toward [female] , `` ah , '' said [female] , in a tone of gratified expectation .
the two friends , with hearts now more united than ever , were inseparable for the day . and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along . mrs. [female] and her son . who were acquainted with everything , and who seemed only to want mr. [male] 's consent . to consider [male] 's engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family .
the cockatoo , a most vicious and treacherous bird towards every one else . absolutely seems to love him , when he lets it out of its cage . it hops on to his knee , and claws its way up his great big body . and rubs its top knot against his sallow double chin in the most caressing manner imaginable . he has only to set the doors of the canaries
i find it odd that he should have omitted from this letter all mention of mlle . binet , and i am disposed to account it at least a partial insincerity that he should have assigned entirely to his self imposed mission . and not at all to his lacerated feelings in the matter of climene . the action which he had taken at the feydau . those two letters , both written in april of that year 1789 .
i was taken through narrow passages and across one or two store rooms to a small but well lighted closet . where i was left , with the assurance that mrs. [female] would presently join me . i had never seen this lady , but i had often heard her spoken of as a woman of superior character and admirable discretion . she did not keep me waiting , in two minutes the door opened and this fine . well poised woman was telling her story in the straight forward manner i so much admire and so seldom meet with .
the windows looked out upon the square yard , the scene was like the interior of a scavenger 's cart . the things , not to speak of the human beings , which lay rusting . mouldering , and putrefying there , were indescribable , the fragments seemed to fraternise together . some fell from the walls , others from the living tenants of the place . the debris were sown with their tatters , a boy of twelve .
[female] lit a candle and led the way into the parlour . the room was empty of furniture ; but at one end there was a stool . a stone mason 's mallet . a few chisels , and a large stone , `` is it , '' began [male] , but he could not finish , the stone was a plain slab .
this morning glory of nature gladdened the girl 's heart and drove from it the overnight vapors . she dressed hurriedly , made a light breakfast , and went out , there was no need to ask the way . in front of the hotel the narrow silser see filled the valley . close behind lay the crest of the pass . a picturesque château was perched on a sheer rock overhanging the vale of bregaglia and commanding a far flung prospect almost to the brink of como .
if there were any bitterness in his nature , it could only show itself against the man who refused to be conciliated by him . and perhaps the time was come for some of that bitterness to rise , at the first moment . [male] had felt pure distress and self reproach at discovering that [male] 's happiness was involved in his relation to hetty . if there had been a possibility of making [male] tenfold amends . if deeds of gift , or any other deeds .
the pretty soubrette cast an anxious glance at [female] . whose good looks seemed to have made an impression on her . the carriage went on , and left the two men facing each other ; no material obstacle separated them . the cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage . but [male] , whose anger , already excited , was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of [male] .
the soldier with the basket soon got a light . and lighted three or four torches , and took one himself and distributed the others . it had been almost dark before , but now it seemed quite dark , and soon afterwards very dark . before we departed from that spot , four soldiers standing in a ring . fired twice into the air , presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us .
`` but i am in love with you , '' he exclaimed . with something like dismay , he leant against the window sill . looking over the city as she had looked , everything had become miraculously different and completely distinct . his feelings were justified and needed no further explanation , but he must impart them to some one . because his discovery was so important that it concerned other people too .
to persons standing alone on a hill during a clear midnight such as this . the roll of the world eastward is almost a palpable movement . the sensation may be caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly objects . which is perceptible in a few minutes of stillness , or by the better outlook upon space that a hill affords . or by the wind , or by the solitude ; but whatever be its origin .
meanwhile [female] was gently but firmly trying to pull [female] 's arm from her waist . her distressful difficulty being that in freeing her waist she enslaved her hand . and in getting her hand free she enslaved her waist . finding the struggle a futile one , owing to the invisibility of her antagonist . and her wish to keep its nature secret from the other two .
the horse plodded on with a dejected air , he would have liked to stop at a number of places they passed . and remain for life , what there was left of it . but he obediently walked on over any kind of an old road that came in his way . and solaced himself with whatever kind of a bite the roadside afforded . he was becoming a much travelled horse , he knew a threshing machine by sight now .
nay , said [male] cote male taile . i will not have sir plenorius livelihood ; with that he will grant you . my lord sir [male] . to come unto king [male] 's court . and to be his knight , and all his brethren , i will pray you .
`` strange that should never have occurred to us , '' said the doctor , `` it 's a perfect way of replenishing our food supply , '' and quite seriously both he and the big business man laid aside some of their food . the doctor was gigantic now in proportion to the other two , and both he and the big business man took a very small quantity more of the drug in an effort to equalize their rate of bodily reduction . they evidently hit it about right . for no further change in their relative size occurred , all this time the vegetation underneath them had been growing steadily larger .
nan nodded , and feeling much relieved now that the responsibility was off her shoulders . took the lads to dr watkins , who promised to come out later and examine [female] . a [female] tea at nan 's house . which was kept open for her all summer , did them good . and by the time they got home in the cool of the evening no sign of the panic remained but ted 's heavy eyes .
hereupon the father got up from his chair and turned round . facing the fire , with his back to his son . he was becoming very angry , but endeavoured to restrain his anger , the matter in dispute between them was of so great importance . that he could hardly be justified in abandoning it in consequence of arguments so trifling in themselves as these which his son adduced . as he stood there for some minutes thinking of it all .
chairs were set at the long brown table of massive oak . and the officers sat down , facing the open door and the blaze of [male] on the poop deck . their backs to the other door and the horn windows which opened upon the stern gallery . the middle place was assumed by lord [male] goade by virtue of his office of queen 's lieutenant . and the reason for his chain of office became now apparent .
evidently armandjust and his three companions had managed to creep along the side of the cliffs . whilst the men , like true soldiers of the well drilled republican army . had with blind obedience , and in fear of their own lives . implicitly obeyed [organization] 's orders -- to wait for the tall englishman . who was the important capture , they had no doubt reached one of the creeks which jut far out to sea on this coast at intervals .
was it an angel 's voice , not altogether . it was [male] 's , the boy was leaning out of a window some six feet higher up the castle wall . [male] , his eyes by now grown used to the darkness . perceived that the stripling gesticulated as one having some message to impart , then , glancing to one side . he saw what looked like some kind of a rope swayed against the wall .
mrs. [male] whispered in my ear . `` i have got a body to this dress , and it can not be found anywhere . '' the rector 's prodigious voice was never silent : the pompous and plausible little man talked . talked , talked , in deeper and deeper bass , until the very teacups on the table shuddered under the influence of him . the elder children , admitted to the family festival .
shouted mrs roper , `` run for the police ; run for the police ! '' but [female] , who had more presence of mind than her mother . stopped [female] as she was making to one of the front windows . `` keep where you are , '' said [female] , `` they will come quiet in a minute or two . '' and [female] no doubt was right , calling for the police when there is a row in the house is like summoning the water engines when the soot is on fire in the kitchen chimney .
a sigh , and they departed , the church was invisible . but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour . this was a stained window , through which some feeble light was shining , and when the door opened [male] heard mr. [male] 's voice running through the litany to a minute congregation . even their church , built upon the slope of the hill so artfully . with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingle .
[organization] would sit on a low stool between them in the white dress that radway loved . it made the solitude for which they were both waiting seem more precious to see her thus at a distance . pale and fragile and miraculous against the sombre background of the roscarna oak . then [male] would begin to yawn , and fidget for the nightcap of hot whiskey that [male] prepared for him . and at last discreetly vanish , and so the most precious of their moments began .
the jury duly came and viewed the bodies . the inquest was held ; and next arrived the melancholy morning of the funeral , accounts in the newspapers had brought to the spot curious idlers . who stood apparently counting the window panes and the stones of the walls . doubt of the real relations of the couple added zest to their curiosity . sue had declared that she would follow the two little ones to the grave .
he was smiling rather foolishly , and he spoke eagerly , with an insinuating determination . [male] and i will share one room , said the russian in his discreet , precise voice . halliday and he were friends since [male] . `` it 's very simple , '' said [male] , rising and pressing back his arms , stretching himself .
mr. [male] had sliced his hot roll into three feather beds . and was slipping butter in between the blankets , and covering it up . he was a prosperous old bachelor , and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard . and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace . and i did not doubt that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags .
it is true that their voice was the only one which he could still hear . on this score , the big [organization] was his beloved , it was she whom he preferred out of all that family of noisy girls which bustled above him . on festival days , this [organization] was named [female] . she was alone in the southern tower , with her sister jacqueline . a [organization] of lesser size , shut up in a smaller cage beside hers .
to the gentle , hapless virgin . to whom such possessions were as the wardrobe of a queen . the temptation to behold them near was too great , she could not forbear from passing the threshold . and she did with heaving breast . she approached the bed and gazed ; she dared to touch the scented gloves that lay by the outspread petticoat of blue and silver .
in jumping at publicans and sinners they would forget that a word might be said for the worries of scribes and pharisees . and this defect or limitation might have recommended their own daughter in law to them at this moment as a fairly choice sort of lost person for their love . thereupon she began to plod back along the road by which she had come not altogether full of hope . but full of a conviction that a crisis in her life was approaching . no crisis , apparently , had supervened ; and there was nothing left for her to do but to continue upon that starve acre farm till she could again summon courage to face the vicarage .
the two men with the pincers gave a heave . and , scattering the fire this way and that upon the rocky floor . lifted from it a large earthenware pot . heated to a white heat , in an instant , almost with a single movement . they had reached the spot where mahomed was struggling .
opening from the porch was the grand hall , which extended up to the top of the house . it was magnificent , indeed ; being decorated with many coloured marbles , and hung round with various trophies of the house of omnium . banners were there , and armour ; the sculptured busts of many noble progenitors . full length figures in marble of those who had been especially prominent ; and every monument of glory that wealth . long years , and great achievements could bring together , if only a man could but live in his hall and be for ever happy there !
i told him , and he went out at the hall door immediately to join his wife . his manner when he spoke to me was so unusually quiet and subdued that i turned and looked after him . wondering if he were ill or out of spirits , why my next proceeding was to go straight up to the post bag and take out my own letter and look at it again . with a vague distrust on me , and why the looking at it for the second time instantly suggested the idea to my mind of sealing the envelope for its greater security . are mysteries which are either too deep or too shallow for me to fathom , women , as everybody knows .
i must have been less than five when i penned this : i was always a letter writer , it seems . it is a reproach now from many that i have ceased to be . and to them i fear it is true , that i have not truly ceased . `` witness under my hand these presents , '' or whatever may be the proper legal terms for an affidavit , what were you like .
at about half past eight o'clock they reached the first houses in [location] . every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village . the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses . here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots . from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores .
[female] touched [female] 's hand . and the pressure in return told her that they understood each other . that they knew how in this illness to the old , world weary woman . god had sent her a veiled blessing . she was once more in the scenes of her childhood .
his general manner was oppressed , and he frequently raised his hat to wipe his forehead . which was high and bald , at his elbow stood [organization] . [male] 's very opposite , a tall , harsh , angular man , long features . a dingy complexion , and the air of a dismissed soldier . he held a glass of whisky and water in a hairy hand .
i have acted on this bit of logic . i began experimentally by tossing small chunks of fat pork and crusts of stale bread overside . when the birds descended for the feast i shot them . every carcass thus left floating on the surface of the sea was so much less meat for the mutineers . but i bettered the method , yesterday i overhauled the medicine chest , and i dosed my chunks of fat pork and bread with the contents of every bottle that bore a label of skull and cross bones .
the true hobbledehoy is much alone , not being greatly given to social intercourse even with other hobbledehoys . a trait in his character which i think has hardly been sufficiently observed by the world at large . he has probably become a hobbledehoy instead of an [male] , because circumstances have not afforded him much social intercourse . and , therefore , he wanders about in solitude , taking long walks . in which he dreams of those successes which are so far removed from his powers of achievement .
the representation of a monstrous animal solemnly drawn about in tarascon and other french towns . without doubt , this strange beacon light would awaken far away . the woodcutter of the hills of bicêtre . terrified to behold the gigantic shadow of the towers of notre dame quivering over his heaths . a terrified silence ensued among the outcasts , during which nothing was heard .
i will well , said the king , that he be sent for . that we may be friends , then the barons sent for sir [male] under a safe conduct . and so when sir [male] came to the king he was welcome . and no rehearsal was made , and there was game and play . and then the king and the queen went a hunting , and sir [female] .
but [female] shakes her head and insists that human nature is human nature . and that under similar circumstances human nature will express itself similarly . in short , she points to the number of deaths that have already occurred . and declares that on some dark night , sooner or later , whenever the pinch of hunger sufficiently sharpens . we shall see our rascals storming aft .
to his astonishment there stood within the room diggory venn . no longer a reddleman , but exhibiting the strangely altered hues of an ordinary [male] countenance . white shirt front , light flowered waistcoat , blue spotted neckerchief , and bottle green coat . nothing in this appearance was at all singular but the fact of its great difference from what he had formerly been . red , and all approach to red , was carefully excluded from every article of clothes upon him .
she stood up and wandered across the room , archer , remaining seated , watched the light movements of her figure . so girlish even under its heavy furs , the cleverly planted heron wing in her fur cap . and the way a dark curl lay like a flattened vine spiral on each cheek above the ear . his mind , as always when they first met , was wholly absorbed in the delicious details that made her herself and no other . presently he rose and approached the case before which she stood .
the light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that you saw her in the white . and she saw you in the [female] . this light was symbolical , nevertheless , your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was made in that place shut off from all glances . a profound vagueness enveloped that form clad in mourning . your eyes searched that vagueness , and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition .
out in the fields , with his stick in his hand . he is very eloquent , cutting off the heads of the springing summer weeds . as he practises his oratory with energy . and thus he feeds an imagination for which those who know him give him but scanty credit . and unconsciously prepares himself for that latter ripening , if only the ungenial shade will some day cease to interpose itself .
they reached the hotel shortly and were conducted to mr. [male] 's private apartment . where wine was ordered , and promptly served , for years thereafter , [male] never heard the clinking of glasses and bottles borne on a tray without an instant 's sickening sinking of the heart . and the foreboding that seemed to drench him with dismay as the glasses were placed on the stand at mr. [male] 's elbow . when that gentleman , after seeing the waiter disappear . and placing certain papers before him , began speaking , [male] sat dazedly listening .
mrs. [female] sat before the hearth in her salon . with her hands fallen in her lap , at thirty eight the emotions engrave themselves more deeply in the face than they do in our first youth . or than they will when we have really aged , and the pretty woman looked haggard . imogene came in , wearing a long blue robe . flung on as if with desperate haste ; her thick hair fell crazily out of a careless knot .
he looked at his watch , and , in pursuit of this idea . he went on till he came to a public hall . where a promenade concert was in progress . jude entered , and found the room full of shop youths and girls . soldiers , apprentices , boys of eleven smoking cigarettes .
not but what we might have grazed there had it been our pleasure . but that it was not worth our while , and scarcely worth [male] 's even . all the land being cropped with desolation , and nearly all our knowledge of it sprang from the unaccountable tricks of cows who have young calves with them . at which time they have wild desire to get away from the sight of man . and keep calf and milk for one another , although it be in a barren land .
one can not imagine a lovelier masterpiece of a creative hand than that bust . and it is a painter 's right . nay , his duty , not merely to look , but to observe , a dangerous privilege . my hand trembled , i seemed to freeze , and yet beads of sweat stood out upon my forehead ... she , too , seemed to remark my agitation , a roguish flame sparkled in her eye .
i threw the letter away in disgust . just as it had fluttered to the ground , there was a knock at my door . and sir [male] 's solicitor , mr. [male] . was shown in , there are many varieties of sharp practitioners in this world . but i think the hardest of all to deal with are the men who overreach you under the disguise of inveterate good humour .
throughout that last day mr. [male] wandered here and there about the house and garden that so soon were to be deserted . he was dreadfully at a loss what to do with himself . and , alas , it was not today only that he felt the burden of his hopeless idleness . he felt it always ; a horrible load . not to be cast away from him , his life had been broken off short .
there is wild talk of cannon aboard . and of strange raids and expeditions she may make . ranging from opium smuggling into the states and arms smuggling into [location] . to blackbirding and open piracy , yet i can not but believe for i have never yet caught him in a lie . while he has a cyclopadic knowledge of sealing and the men of the sealing fleets .
she said `` perhaps '' between the sips of her coffee . and the sound of her taking her breath in the word . was nauseous to him , he rose quickly to be away from her , he went and made arrangements for the departure on the morrow . then , taking some food , he set out for the day on the skis . perhaps , he said to the wirt , he would go up to the marienhutte .
i have only further to request that you will not address any further communication to me . should you do so , it will be refused , trevelyan had also written two other letters to england . one to mr. bideawhile and the other to bozzle , in the former he acquainted the lawyer that he had discovered that his wife still maintained her intercourse with colonel osborne . and that he must therefore remove his child from her custody . he then inquired what steps would be necessary to enable him to obtain possession of his little boy .
and she gave him some good beef tea . a slice of mutton , a piece of bacon . and sometimes small glasses of brandy , that he had not the strength to put to his lips . [male] , hearing that he was growing worse , asked to see him . he began by pitying his sufferings , declaring at the same time that he ought to rejoice at them since it was the will of the lord .
but he by wild and way , for half the night . and over hard and soft , striking the sod from out the soft , the spark from off the hard . rode till the star above the wakening sun . beside that tower where [male] was cowled , glanced from the [male] forehead of the dawn . for so the words were flashed into his heart he knew not whence or wherefore .
these lamps were of a rude manufacture of baked earthenware . and of all shapes , some of them graceful enough , the larger ones were formed of big red earthenware pots . filled with clarified melted fat , and having a reed wick stuck through a wooden disk which filled the top of the pot . this sort of lamp required the most constant attention to prevent its going out whenever the wick burnt down . as there were no means of turning it up , the smaller hand lamps .
i never ad none , was the cockney 's comment , as he gazed with lustreless . hopeless eyes into mine , all of which has set me wondering . where are the mothers of these twenty and odd men on the ghost ? it strikes me as unnatural and unhealthful that men should be totally separated from women and herd through the world by themselves .
what a title , people of [location] ! what a heap of creatures , i have just returned to my louvre . my horses , just unharnessed , are still smoking , and i have created interest enough to induce scarcely twenty persons to look at me as i passed , twenty ! what do i say ? no ; there were not twenty anxious to see the king of [location] . there are not even ten archers to guard my palace of residence .
for miss crawford , who had seen scores of great houses . and cared for none of them , had only the appearance of civilly listening . while [female] , to whom everything was almost as interesting as it was new . attended with unaffected earnestness to all that mrs. [female] could relate of the family in former times . its rise and grandeur , regal visits and loyal efforts .
on this occasion , however , the servant at once asked him to go into the dining room . and there he found himself in the presence of [male] gresham . the fact was , that lady [male] , having at last decided , had sent for dr thorne . and it had become necessary that some one should be entrusted with the duty of informing dr fillgrave . that some one must be the squire , or [female] , lady [female] would doubtless have preferred a messenger more absolutely friendly to her own side of the house .
jasper , controlling his voice with an effort . ordered the car to be brought round for him in a quarter of an hour . and after the man had left the room , he took a bunch of keys . and , selecting one , opened a drawer in his bureau , from it he took a small fortune in notes and gold . and going to his bedroom he changed his evening clothes for a blue serge suit and put on a heavy travelling ulster .
nearing the house sammy began to wonder what she should do next . with all her heart the girl believed in her father 's innocence . she did not know why those men were at her home . but she did know that the money that helped her father over the drought had come through the shepherd . the matthews family , too , had been helped the same way .
so while he talked to this girl of work and freedom . his slightly protuberant eyes were noting the gracious balance of her limbs and body across the gate . the fine lines of her chin and neck . her grave fine face , her warm clear complexion , had already aroused his curiosity as he had gone to and fro in morningside park . and here suddenly he was near to her and talking freely and intimately , he had found her in a communicative mood .
mr. [male] reached [location] about three o'clock . and his first act was to drive to [male] and son 's . where he was informed that old mr. [male] was much better . and having heard that he was coming to town had sent to say that he particularly wished to see him . especially about the [male] castle estates .
soon after her arrival there she chanced to meet judge [male] and his wife . something in their looks seemed familiar , and also awoke a painful reminiscence of the dark kitchen and the lone garret far off in the great city . she could not remember ever having seen them , and so dismissed the subject from her mind . merely wondering if they knew that she who was to be their brother 's wife once lighted fires and cleaned potatoes as a common servant girl . the reader will perhaps have imagined that the gentleman who befriended [male] was none other than judge [male] .
the lips of the lovers met in the shadow of the portico . and when [male] came through the hall he found the duke alone . the two men linked arms and fell to pacing up and down the gravelled space in front of the house . it was not yet eleven and quietude had once more settled down over the casa luzo . as they walked , [male] was relating to the duke how he had seen the two prisoners safely disposed of in one of the roomy cellars that ran out under the back courtyard .
while waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee prince [male] looked up his former acquaintances . particularly those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need . in petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle . when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling circles where the future . on which the fate of millions depended , was being shaped , from the irritation of the older men .
her neglect of her husband , her encouragement of other men . her extravagance and dissipation , were so gross and notorious that no one could be ignorant of them at the time . nor can now have forgotten them , to our family she has always been represented in softened colours by the benevolence of mr. [male] . and yet , in spite of his generous endeavours to excuse her . we know that she did , from the most selfish motives .
a kind of esplanade runs for nearly a mile along the sands . and there are built , or in the course of building , rows of houses appropriated to summer visitors all looking out upon the sea . there is no beauty unless the yellow sandy sea can be called beautiful . the coast is low and straight , and the east wind blows full upon it . but the place is healthy ; and mrs greenow was probably right in thinking that she might there revive some portion of the health which she had lost in watching beside the couch of her departing lord .
here she told him where she wanted to go . upon which he plunged down an obscure side street . and stopped at one of the entrances to the temple , here mrs. [female] alighted . and had to inquire her way to mr. [male] 's chambers . she was so unaccustomed to be out alone , that this expedition seemed something almost awful to her when she found herself helpless and solitary in that strange locality .
to night , i was not so mutinous , nor so miserable , my [male] lay quiet in the tent , slumbering . and if his pain ached through his slumbers , something like an angel . the ideal -- knelt near , dropping balm on the soothed temples . holding before the sealed eyes a magic glass , of which the sweet . solemn visions were repeated in dreams , and shedding a reflex from her moonlight wings and robe over the transfixed sleeper .
asmodeus -- that diabolical personage , who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiece . would have enjoyed a singular spectacle , if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the rue saint germain des pres . while debray was casting up his figures , above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another . inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest . [organization] and [female] were in that room .
`` but she 's only a farm woman , '' said [female] , and her explanation proved correct , [female] only censured the lower classes when it suited him . he bore with miss [organization] as with crane . because he could get good value out of them . `` i have patience with a man who knows his job , ''
after a year and a day he returned to the court of king mark and lived there . and all the knights and ladies admired him . and the praise of his courtesy was in the mouths of all . noble and simple , high and low , then king mark his uncle began to hate him for the love that all bore him . and since he had never married and had no son to whom his kingdom should go after his death .
she was naturally the subject of many observations this evening . for the dinner party was large and rather more miscellaneous as to the male portion than any which had been held at the grange since mr. [male] 's nieces had resided with him . so that the talking was done in duos and trios more or less inharmonious , there was the newly elected mayor of middlemarch . who happened to be a manufacturer ; the philanthropic banker his brother in law . who predominated so much in the town that some called him a methodist .
florence , when she heard all this , became aware that in talking about a month she had forgotten herself . she had been accustomed to holidays of a month 's duration . and to honeymoon trips fitted to such vacations , a month was the longest holiday ever heard of in the chambers of the adelphi . or at the house in onslow crescent , she had forgotten herself . it was not to be the lot of her husband to earn his bread .
vavasor hall was , by the road . about five miles from shap , and it was not altogether an easy task for [female] to get over to the village without informing her grandfather that the visit was to be made . and what was its purport , she could , indeed , walk , and the walk would not be so long as that she had taken with [female] to swindale fell . but walking to an inn on a high road , is not the same thing as walking to a point on a hill side over a lake . had she been dirty , draggled , and wet through on swindale fell , it would have simply been matter for mirth .
the case is yours , molly , settled out of court , and the possession nine points of the law clause works in some cases for a woman against a man . generally speaking , anyway , the pup belongs to the man who can whistle him down . and you can whistle bill from me any day . i am just his father , and what i think or want does not matter .
[female] , unable to answer , [female] waited for her at the fir tree gate . while she went over the house and said farewell to every room . she was going away ; but the old house would still be there , looking seaward through its quaint windows . the autumn winds would blow around it mournfully . and the gray rain would beat upon it and the white mists would come in from the sea to enfold it .
master [male] dropped in again last friday . but he chose a most unpropitious time , for [male] and [male] and i were just running to catch a train . and where do you think we were going ? to [location] . to attend a dance and a ball game . if you please , i did not ask you if i might go .
the poet 's reflections during the night were thoroughly matter of fact . he sincerely saw nothing worse in life than the situation of a married man without money . still trembling at the danger he had been led into by his vanity . his desire to get the better of the duke , and his belief in the mignon millions . he began to ask himself what the duchess must be thinking of his stay in havre .
thus , for different reasons , what was to the rest an exhilarating movement was to these two a riding upon the whirlwind . the dance had come like an irresistible attack upon whatever sense of social order there was in their minds . to drive them back into old paths which were now doubly irregular , through three dances in succession they spun their way . and then , fatigued with the incessant motion , [female] turned to quit the circle in which she had already remained too long . wildeve led her to a grassy mound a few yards distant .
one evening she discovered him leaning over a gate on rub down hill . the gate at which [male] had once been standing , and which opened on the brink of a steep . slanting down directly into blackmoor vale , or the vale of the white [male] . extending beneath the eye at this point to a distance of many miles . his attention was fixed on the landscape far away , and [male] 's approach was so noiseless that he did not hear her .
he had a few guineas in his pocket . and made a wry face over them , `` ill gotten gains , '' says he , for some were the scraped savings of [male] tutor and some the pocket money of [male] 's husband . but he was in no case to be delicate , beef and bread had to be paid for . and , in fact , his scruples were little more than a joke .
so they rode on till even song time , and ever she chid him and would not cease . and then they came to a [male] lawn . and there was a [male] hawthorn , and thereon hung a [male] banner . and on the other side there hung a [male] shield . and by it stood a [male] spear great and long , and a great [male] horse covered with silk .
desgas went to give the necessary orders to one of the men . not a word of this conversation between him and chauvelin had escaped marguerite . and every word they had spoken seemed to strike at her heart . with terrible hopelessness and dark foreboding , she had come all this way . and with such high hopes and firm determination to help her husband .
take the other angle , say [female] had not been sent for , say he knew nothing of the cabin or its occupants until he stumbled on them . he had sold the ranch , distributed his brother 's books . and apparently the townspeople at dry river believed that he had gone back home . then what had taken him , clearly alone and having certainly given the impression of a departure for the east . into the mountains ? to hunt ? to hunt what , that he went about it secretly and alone ?
on account of our birds , cats were not allowed in the house . but from a friend in [location] i received a present of a white kitten—williamina—and she and her numerous offspring had a happy home at `` gad 's hill. '' she became a favorite with all the household . and showed particular devotion to my father , i remember on one occasion when she had presented [female] with a family of kittens . she selected a corner of father 's study for their home .
a stream of morning light through the shutter chink fell upon the faces of the pair . wrapped in profound slumber , tess 's lips being parted like a half opened flower near his cheek . the caretaker was so struck with their innocent appearance , and with the elegance of tess 's gown hanging across a chair . her silk stockings beside it , the pretty parasol . and the other habits in which she had arrived because she had none else .
there 's probably as much corruption in zinc made money as brass made money . as for the well-known amory , he would write immortal literature if he were sure enough about anything to risk telling any one else about it . there is no more dangerous gift to posterity than a few cleverly turned platitudes . [male] , why do not you become a catholic ? of course to be a good one you would have to give up those violent intrigues you used to tell me about . but you would write better poetry if you were linked up to tall golden candlesticks and long .
the host paid without remarks what seemed to the applebys an enormous bill . a dollar and sixty cents . and rambled out to the car , still unknowing that two happy people wanted to follow him with their blessings . this history is unable to give any further data regarding him . when his car went round the bend he disappeared from the fortunes of the applebys .
mr [organization] , who was a [male] . chatty companion , had hardly seated himself , and was talking to [male] as quickly as he could . when mr [male] , who sat at the bottom of the table . asked him to say [male] , it seemed to be quite out of the question that the duke should take any trouble with his guests whatever . mr [organization] consequently dropped the word he was speaking .
a few ribbons and gay handkerchiefs . mostly of cotton , for the eyes of the country people on market days . formed the chief part of their humble show , the door was wide and very low . the upper half of it of glass . old , and bottle colored ; and its threshold was a deep step down into the shop .
it was , however , still possible that the presence of the man might do something . hitherto , since the deed had been done , no stranger had dined in manchester square . she herself had seen no visitor . she had hardly left the house except to go to church , and then had been enveloped in the deepest crape . once or twice she had allowed herself to be driven out in a carriage .
for five days thorpe cut wood , made fires . drew water , swept floors , and ran errands . sometimes he would look across the broad stump dotted plain to the distant forest . he had imagination , no business man succeeds without it . with him the great struggle to wrest from an impassive and aloof nature what she has so long held securely as her own .
`` call bateese , '' she answered promptly , and she rose swiftly from beside him and moved toward the door . he made no effort to call her back . his wits were working slowly , readjusting themselves after a carnival in chaos . and he scarcely sensed that she was gone until the cabin door closed behind her . then again he raised a hand to his face and felt his beard , three days !
the book in question , however , was no other than the treatise of doctor tilingius upon the rhubarb plant . published in [location] in 1679 , it was by no means certain that gilliatt did not prepare philters and unholy decoctions . he was undoubtedly in possession of certain phials . why did he walk abroad at evening , and sometimes even at midnight . on the cliffs ? evidently to hold converse with the evil spirits who .
mr [male] does not know , but he makes as if he did . by responsively nodding his head , he also follows with his eyes . the toss of [male] 's head . as if to seek a direction to over yonder , he had raised the candle at arm 's length towards one of the dark shelves . and mr [male] had turned to look , when he broke off .
together they sauntered through the lengthening shadows to a certain small restaurant near woodward avenue . then much in vogue among [location] 's epicures . it contained only a half dozen tables . but was spotlessly clean , and its cuisine was unrivalled , a large fireplace near the center of the room robbed it of half its restaurant air . and a thick carpet on the floor took the rest .
now that he was alone , question after question leapt unanswered through his mind . and every vein in his body throbbed with strange excitement . not for an instant did he doubt what she had said . this world -- the forests about him . the lakes , the blue skies above , were her home .
he gathered his reins and drew up his horse . lifting his hat with a perfect gesture , `` there are sadder blows than losing one 's sovereign , mademoiselle ! '' and he shook his bared head mournfully and rode back to find his friend . she sought now her favorite bridle paths and her heart was light with the sweetness and [female] of the spring as she heard the rush and splash of the creek . saw the flash of wings and felt the mystery of awakened life throbbing about her .
the fasts and feasts should be observed with the consent of the elders of the house . the resources should be increased by making purchases and sales according to the practice of the merchants . and by means of honest servants , superintended by herself . the income should be increased , and the expenditure diminished as much as possible , and when her husband returns from his journey . she should receive him at first in her ordinary clothes .
gilbert left the court after having asked a few questions about [male] 's funeral . the old man had been buried at kensalgreen , followed to the grave only by the devoted [male] . mr. [male] , and the local surgeon who had attended him in his last illness . he had lived a lonely friendless life , holding himself aloof from his fellow creatures . and there were neither neighbours nor friends to lament his ending , the vagabond boys of the neighbourhood had clustered round the door to witness the last dismal ceremony of mr. [male] 's existence .
his eyes were arresting -- brown , full , like a rabbit 's . or like a troll 's , or like the eyes of a lost being , having a strange . dumb , depraved look of knowledge , and a quick spark of uncanny fire . whenever [male] had tried to talk to him he had shied away unresponsive . looking at her with his watchful dark eyes , but entering into no relation with her .
she was at her toilet table being prepared for the night , and her long hair brushed and dressed before retiring . [female] wimpole had come in to the chamber to do something at her bidding . and chancing to stand gazing at her great and heavy fall of locks as she was waiting . she observed a thing which caused her . foolish woman that she was , to give a start and utter an unwise exclamation .
it had yards and yards of cheap lace and insertion . and a whole bolt of pink ribbons of various widths . the hat was a marvel of impossible roses . just calculated for the worst kind of a wreck if a thunder shower should come up at a sunday school picnic . [female] 's mother was even thinking of getting her a pink chiffon parasol to carry .
it is true that mr maguire had never asked her to marry him . but she believed that he would ask her if she gave him any encouragement . now it was to come to pass , by a wonderful arrangement of circumstances . that she was to meet these two gentlemen together , it might well be . that on this very occasion , she must choose whether it should be either or neither .
but how about his forgiveness ? that must be obtained first , if there were only this [male] boy to deal with . in his white flannels and yellow roses , with a may day madness in his veins . the license might come at once ; and all he could wish should happen without delay . but this is a passing phase of [female] , what she has to deal with is the white faced man . who calmly said : `` i accept the cross , '' and walked down the village church leaving her .
they seemed the very voice of that heroic passion which is falsely said to devote itself in vain when it achieves the god like end of manifesting unselfish love . and that passion was present to [male] now as the vivid image of a man dying helplessly away from the possibility of battle . [male] was equal to his wishes , while the general applause was sounding . [female] gave a more valued testimony , audible to her only -- good , good -- the crescendo better than before . but her chief anxiety was to know that she had satisfied mr. [male] .
fourthly and chiefly it was impossible , because never since the world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained in 1812 . and [organization] in its pursuit of the french strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying itself . and it is of this period of the campaign . when the army lacked boots and sheepskin coats . was short of provisions and without vodka , and was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of frost .
also a letter from father salvierderra . upon reading which he sank into a fit of despondency that lasted a day or two . and gave his infamous associates considerable alarm , lest they had lost their comrade . but he soon shook off the influence , whatever it was . and settled back into his old gait on the same old high road to the devil .
i should have remembered my position , and have put myself secretly on my guard . i did so , but not till it was too late , all the discretion . all the experience , which had availed me with other women . and secured me against other temptations , failed me with her . it had been my profession , for years past .
madame [female] treymes friendly observation of her sister in law 's visitors resulted in no expression on her part of a desire to renew her study of them . to all appearances , she passed out of their lives when madame [female] malrive 's door closed on her . and durham felt that the arduous task of making her acquaintance was still to be begun . he felt also , more than ever , the necessity of attempting it .
it was no longer a hand to hand conflict ; it was a shadow . a fury , a dizzy transport of souls and courage . a hurricane of lightning swords , in an instant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred . fuller , their lieutenant colonel , fell dead , ney rushed up with the lancers and lefebvre desnouettes 's light horse . the plateau of mont saint jean was captured , recaptured , captured again , the cuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry .
if the roof of the house had suddenly flown off , the old gentleman would not have been more astonished . but he liked it , oh , dear , yes , he liked it amazingly ! and was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished . and he just set her on his knee . and laid his wrinkled cheek against her [male] one , feeling as if he had got his own little granddaughter back again .
[male] set the washtub on the floor near the sleeping child . and filling the dishpan with water , put it over the gasoline burner . then he produced soap , a towel , and comb . he looked at the child again , and going to the box that contained his mother 's clothing he hunted out a nightdress . then he sat down to wait for the water to heat .
the man is pure man , the woman pure woman . they are perfectly polarised , but there is no longer any of the horrible merging . mingling self abnegation of love , there is only the pure duality of polarisation . each one free from any contamination of the other , in each , the individual is primal . sex is subordinate , but perfectly polarised , each has a single , separate being .
he began stripping off his shirt , and with a bellow in his throat concombre bateese slouched away like a beaten gorilla to explain [male] 's people the change in the plan of battle . and as that news spread like fire in the fir tops . there came but a single cry in response -- shrill and terrible . and that was from the throat of andre , the broken man . as carrigan stripped off his shirt , he knew that at least in one way he had met more than his match inpierre boulain .
then a miracle happened , the nurse , so clean she smelled like a drug store . so lovely she shone as a sunrise , laid an arm across mickey 's shoulders . `` you come with me , '' she said . she went to a little room , and all alone she asked mickey questions . with his eyes straight on hers , he answered .
the steady radiance seemed for a second to have its counterpart within her ; she shut her eyes . she opened them and looked at the lamp again . another love burnt in the place of the old one . or so , in a momentary glance of amazement , she guessed before the revelation was over and the old surroundings asserted themselves . she leant in silence against the mantelpiece .
it seems queer to be writing letters to somebody you do not know . it seems queer for me to be writing letters at all . i have never written more than three or four in my life , so please overlook it if these are not a model kind . before leaving yesterday morning , mrs. [female] and i had a very serious talk . she told me how to behave all the rest of my life .
[male] came slowly down the stairs , and stood before him . her face was pale , her mouth set and determined . the light of her eyes veiled in gloom . kester shrank from her look . and even more from her silence , `` a 'm come to ax pardon , '' said he .
[female] always knew when she had annoyed or embarrassed him . not because he reproved her in any way . to have shown heat in words would have been against his principles . but because he did show heat in his neck . where a faint flush would spread upwards to his ears above the band of his clerical collar .
reduce the grandest type of man hitherto known to an abstract statement of his qualities and efforts . and he appears in dangerous company : say that , like [male] and [male] . he was immovably convinced in the face of hissing incredulity . but so is the contriver of perpetual motion , we can not fairly try the spirits by this sort of test . if we want to avoid giving the dose of hemlock or the sentence of banishment in the wrong case .
[female] found all this out not from words , madame stahl talked to [female] as to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory of one 's youth . and only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith . and that in the sight of [female] 's compassion for [female] no sorrow is trifling . and immediately talked of other things , but in every gesture of madame stahl . in every word , in every heavenly -- as [female] called it .
the situation is hopelessly grotesque , we in the high place command the food of the elsinore . but the mutineers have captured her steering gear , that is to say , they have captured it without coming into possession of it . they can not steer , neither can we , the poop . which is the high place , is ours , the wheel is on the poop . yet we can not touch the wheel , from that slitted opening in the ventilator shaft they are able to shoot down any man who approaches the wheel .
domingo and [female] , wishing , in imitation of their mistresses . to recall to mind angola and foullepoint , the places of their birth in [location] . gave those names to the little fields where the grass was sown with which they wove their baskets . and where they had planted a calabash tree , thus , by cultivating the productions of their respective climates . these exiled families cherished the dear illusions which bind [female] to our native country .
at any rate , it looked like one , with something white thrown over it . to the right was a similar shelf , on which lay some broidered coverings . over the fire bent the figure of a woman . she was sideways to me and facing the corpse . wrapped in a dark mantle that hid her like a nun 's cloak .
as for his infatuation there was literally no limit to it . it broke out in all sorts of ways . and for miles round was a matter of public notoriety and gossip . over the mantelpiece in his sitting room was a fresh example of it . by one means and another he had obtained several photographs of [female] .
when a comrade fell those who knew him best said : poor fellow . he 's gone , and buried him without a prayer . but the dead who were personally unknown awakened no more feeling than so many leaves fallen by the wayside . it could not well be otherwise , for such is war , individual cases of heroism were common enough . and passed almost unnoticed ; for they were all brave men who came to fight and die if need be .
now fishing , except to the devoted disciple of izaak [female] . is not the most lively of occupations ; therefore , it is scarcely , perhaps , to be wondered that on the day after lady audley 's departure . the two young men ( one of whom was disabled by that heart wound which he bore so quietly . from really taking pleasure in anything , and the other of whom looked upon almost all pleasure as a negative kind of trouble ) . began to grow weary of the shade of the willows overhanging the winding streams about audley .
[female] sage nodded his head several times . his eyes still fixed on the papers before him . one of his first acts on being appointed to [male] was to give instructions . through the proper channels , that all telephone operators were to be warned to report to their supervisors anything that struck them as unusual . no matter how trivial the incident might appear , carefully noting the numbers of the subscribers whose messages seemed out of the ordinary .
in fact i was grateful , or almost so , and i believe i half liked him at the moment . notwithstanding his proviso that what he had done was not out of regard for me . but human nature is perverse , impossible to answer his blunt question in the affirmative . so i disclaimed all tendency to gratitude , and advised him if he expected any reward for his championship . to look for it in a better world , as he was not likely to meet with it here .
chateau renaud was at his post ; apprised by beauchamp of the circumstances . he required no explanation from [male] . the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that chateau renaud did not seek to dissuade him . and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion , debray was not yet come . but [male] knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera .
this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame . and friquet found in it very real enjoyment . but when at last the regiment separated , penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe . near [organization] , in which broussel lived , then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast . and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day .
to this inn , which to him seemed a castle . he advanced , and at a short distance from it he checked [male] . hoping that some dwarf would show himself upon the battlements . and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knight was approaching the castle . but seeing that they were slow about it , and that [male] was in a hurry to reach the stable .
bradley headstone knotted his brows . and squared his large lower jaw , and fixed his eyes on the ground with an air of determination that seemed unnecessary to the occasion . as he replied : `` and there is such a man , '' the secretary had no reason or excuse for prolonging the conversation . and it ended here , within three hours the oakum headed apparition once more dived into the leaving shop . and that night rogue [female] 's recantation lay in the post office .
he had more than doubled the distance , -- apparently without any object . he had been spoken to frequently by unfortunates of both sexes . but had answered a word to no one , he had trudged on and on with his umbrella over his head . but almost unconscious of the cold and wet , and yet he was a man sedulously attentive to his own personal comfort and health . who had at any rate shown this virtue in his mode of living .
i can endure no longer , this is my love , and i will speak to her . lady , am i a stranger to your prayers ? i did not think i should be ever loved : do you indeed love me so much as now you say you do ? ask of the sea bird if it loves the sea , ask of the roses if they love the rain . ask of the little [female] , that will not sing till day break .
he caught her in his arms . and kissed her , in the first rapture of receiving that welcome news . she forced herself away from him without answering a word . she turned her poor blind face round and round . in the search for me , she roughly and angrily put her arm in mine .
as he had a liking for the spot . he seldom let a week pass without paying a visit . sometimes , he went down alone from saturday to monday ; sometimes his partner accompanied him . sometimes , he merely strolled for an hour or two about the house and garden . saw that all was right , and returned to [location] again , at all times .
the curtain rose and the play began , to night it was one of colman 's . who at this time enjoyed great popularity , and mr. [male] supported the leading character . [female] , with her hand privately clasped in [female] 's . and looking as if she did not know it , partly watched the piece and partly the face of the impressionable [male] who had so soon transferred his affections elsewhere . she had not long to wait , when a certain one of the subordinate ladies of the comedy entered on the stage the trumpet [male] in his corner not only looked conscious .
or , if the traveler prefers , he may swing aboard the magnificently equipped and royally appointed [location] limited . one of the finest through trains that this mundane sphere can boast , catch this train in [location] . which you may do any day in the year . and it will carry you with safety . speed and comfort over the fertile farms .
the russian girl looked after madame stahl . and besides that , she was , as [female] observed , on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill . and there were many of them at the springs , and looked after them in the most natural way . this russian girl was not , as [female] gathered , related to madame stahl . nor was she a paid attendant .
the woman was the countess [female] santiago . and the moon 's radiance so lit her dark eyes that she seemed to look straight at [female] in her hammock . the girl 's heart gave a leap of some emotion like fear . yet not fear , she did not stop to analyze it . but she knew that she wished to escape from the woman .
denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of putting the whole column on the alert . so he sent tikhon shcherbaty . a peasant of his party , to shamshevo to try and seize at least one of the french quartermasters who had been sent on in advance . it was a warm rainy autumn day . the sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water .
cliges tells them , and , as they listen . they are amazed and are loud in their praises of his courage and devotion . but , for his part , the duke is furious , swearing and proclaiming his determination to fight cliges . if he dares , in single combat ; and it shall be agreed that if cliges wins the battle the emperor shall proceed unchallenged . and freely take the maiden with him , and if he should kill or defeat cliges .
while felipe continued ill , and was so soothed to rest by his music , there was no room for cavil . it was natural that alessandro came and went as a physician might . but after felipe had recovered , why should this freedom and intimacy continue ? more than once there had been sullen mutterings of this kind on [location] . when all the laborers and servants were gathered there of an evening .
but he was too thoroughly broken down by the calamity which had befallen him to be able to think much of anything . so he asked no further questions , but walked with his father in law and [male] down to the boat by which they were to cross to portsmouth . you did not introduce me to your friend . by the bye , my dear boy , he said . [male] stared at him , muttered something indistinct .
there were a few middle-aged and even elderly women in the train , their silver wiry hair and wrinkled faces . scourged by time and trouble , having almost a grotesque . certainly a pathetic , appearance in such a jaunty situation . in a true view , perhaps , there was more to be gathered and told of each anxious and experienced one . to whom the years were drawing nigh when she should say , `` i have no pleasure in them , ''
the last day of the story is dated just subsequent to that point in the development of the seasons when country people go to bed among nearly naked trees . are lulled to sleep by a fall of rain , and awake next morning among green ones . when the landscape appears embarrassed with the sudden weight and brilliancy of its leaves . when the night jar comes and strikes up for the summer his tune of one note . when the apple trees have bloomed , and the roads and orchard grass become spotted with fallen petals .
he disappeared , [male] seized the cord and gave the signal . then he ran hastily to the end of the long lumber docks . and peered with great eagerness in the direction of the [male] smoke . the steamer was as yet concealed behind a low spit of land which ran out from the west to form one side of the harbor . in a moment , however , her bows appeared , headed directly down towards the straits of mackinaw .
[female] knocked the ashes from his pipe . and rising , walked on slowly toward the house , as he approached , he heard someone playing the piano . and the music accorded well with his mood , or his mood with the music . for it was haunting , and very sweet , and with a recurring melody in a minor key . that seemed to voice all the sorrow of humanity , past , present .
the shock of the amazing discovery which carrigan had made was as complete as it was unexpected . his eyes had looked upon the last thing in the world he might have guessed at or anticipated when they beheld through the window ofpierre 's cabin the beautiful face and partly disrobed figure of carmin fanchet . the first effect of that shock had been to drive him away . his action had been involuntary , almost without the benefit of reason . as if carmin had been [female] herself receiving the caresses which were rightfully hers .
the reader thus knows at once , if not actually as much as we do ourselves . all that we mean to impart to him ; and now let [male] come back to that equipage around which swarmed the fashion of [male] . eagerly pressing forward to catch a word , a smile , or even a look . and actually perched on every spot from which they could obtain a glimpse of those within . a young russian prince , with his arm in a sling .
but i could not , it would have been certainly easier , but i could not . you should have seen him , first of all he was completely dressed with his very cap still on his head just as when he left me on deck two hours before . saying in his soft voice : `` the moment has come to go to bed '' while he meant to go and do that thing and hide in his dark cabin . and watch the stuff do its work , a cold shudder ran down my back .
at this point many , indeed most , women would have gone to bed . but the familiar hampshire air and the knowledge that half an hour 's walking would take her to her beloved home acted on mrs. [female] like a restorative . one glimpse of windles she felt that she must have before she retired for the night . if only to assure herself that it was still there , she had a cup of coffee and a sandwich brought to her by the night porter whom she had roused from sleep . for bedtime is early in windlehurst , and then informed him that she was going for a short walk and would ring when she returned .
old [organization] had a patron : one patron . he had a patron who in a certain sumptuous way . an apologetic way , as if he constantly took an admiring audience to witness that he really could not help being more free with this old fellow than they might have expected . on account of his simplicity and poverty . was mightily good to him , old [organization] had been several times to the marshalsea college .
[male] went round , and found his trusty lieutenant . trumpeter buck , waiting for him . a letter had come to the barracks for [male] in his absence . and the trumpeter , who was going for a walk , had brought it along with him . buck then entered the mill to discuss , if possible , a mug of last year 's mead with the [male] .
having impressed upon my mind ( a slow but , perhaps retentive mind ) . all the bearings of the place , and all its opportunities . and even the curve of the stream along it . and the bushes near the door , i was much inclined to go farther up . and understand all the village , but a bar of red light across the river .
when this list had been examined and commented upon by miss larolles , and viewed and wondered at by [female] . it was restored to its place , the two ladies went together to the auction . permitting [female] , at her repeated request , to return to her own apartment . she returned , however , neither satisfied with the behaviour of her friend . nor pleased with her own situation : the sobriety of her education .
at a sign from nugent , oscar took her hand for the second time . she repeated his name , at a sign from me . the brothers noiselessly placed themselves , one on either side of her . oscar on the left ; nugent on the right . i gave them the signal .
the bright red trousers and top boots , with the deep blue jackets . reminded beverly more than ever of the operatic figures she had seen so often at home . there was a fierce , dark cast to the faces of these soldiers , however , that removed any suggestion of play . the girl was in ecstasies , everything about her appealed to the romantic side of her nature . everything seemed so unreal and so like the storybook , the princess smiled lovingly upon the throngs that lined the street .
sue was for a few moments a little tearful at these reflections . and then the station omnibus came round to take her up . phillotson saw her things put on the top . handed her in , and was obliged to make an appearance of kissing her as he wished her good-bye . which she quite understood and imitated , from the cheerful manner in which they parted the omnibus man had no other idea than that she was going for a short visit .
gerasim and the porter let [female] go . and in the now silent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be heard . [male] , having decided that until he had carried out his design he would disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of french . stood at the half open door of the corridor , intending to conceal himself as soon as the french entered . but the french entered and still [male] did not retire -- an irresistible curiosity kept him there .
when he returned to the box she was still standing in the doorway . and he noticed that his were not the only eyes attracted to her , then another impression sharply diverted his attention . above the fagged faces of the parisian crowd he had caught the fresh fair countenance of owen leath signalling a joyful recognition . the young man , slim and eager , had detached himself from two companions of his own type . and was seeking to push through the press to his step mother 's friend .
first , i would have you know my well laid plans . listen : i have set horses at the gate which leads to parma . when you have done your business we will ride hence . and by tomorrow night - surely my ears are traitors . speak again : it can not be but age has dulled my powers .
mr. [male] , as far as words went . had got the best of his adversary , this had taken place in the presence of the prince . who had expressed himself as greatly annoyed by mr. [male] 's conduct . and afterwards [male] had waylaid mr. [male] in the passage between bolton row and berkeley street . and had there -- murdered him , as it happened , no one who had been at the universe was at that moment present .
now it happened that on one beautiful afternoon towards the end of april . mrs. [female] had taken young [male] lawle and another little boy with her over the foot bridge which passed from the bottom of the parsonage garden to the glebe meadow which ran on the other side of a little river . and with them had gone a great newfoundland dog . who was on terms equally friendly with the inmates of the rectory and the school . where this bridge passed across the stream the gardens and the field were on the same level .
the eyes of the stray cat flared round for a moment . like great green fires staring at birkin , then she had rushed in a soft swift rush . half way down the garden , there she paused to look round . the mino turned his face in pure superiority to his master . and slowly closed his eyes , standing in statuesque young perfection .
as she descended the stairs she caught a glimpse of herself in a mirror , she started . surely that could not be patricia brent , secretary to a rising politician . that stylish looking girl in [female] , with a large bunch of carnations . that red haired creature with sparkling eyes and a colour that seemed to have caught the reflection of the carnations in her belt ! patricia was conscious of bowing and smiling sweetly , some sub conscious power seemed to take possession of her .
strange , sad bride 's dreams these ; but they made ramona 's heart beat with happiness as she dreamed them . the first day had gone , it was near night of the second . and not a word had passed between felipe and ramona . except in the presence of the senora , it would have been beautiful to see . if it had not been so cruel a thing , the various and devious methods by which the senora had brought this about .
aunt gillenormand went and came , in affright . wringing her hands and incapable of doing anything but saying , heavens ! is it possible ? at times she added . `` everything will be covered with blood , '' when her first horror had passed off . a certain philosophy of the situation penetrated her mind .
at length their hatred and fear grew to such a degree that they determined to make away with her . and one day , having matured a plan , they went to the wood and spread themselves two and two about it . the couples did not keep together , but moved about or remained concealed at a distance of forty or fifty yards apart . lest she should be missed , two of the savages , armed with blow pipes . were near the border of the forest on the side nearest to the village .
she wished that he would leave her . for she had ridden out into the spring [male] to be alone . he somehow did not appear to advantage in his riding coat , -- his belongings were too perfect . she had really enjoyed his talk when they had met here and there abroad . but she was in no mood for him now .
before he was summoned back to lake geneva , he had appeared . shy but inwardly glowing , in his first long trousers , set off by a purple accordion tie and a `` belmont '' collar with the edges unassailably meeting . purple socks , and handkerchief with a purple border peeping from his breast pocket . but more than that , he had formulated his first philosophy , a code to live by . which , as near as it can be named , was a sort of aristocratic egotism .
a stranger to city ways might probably have said that he was idle . but he was no doubt filling his mind with that erudition which would enable him to earn his bread . on the other side of the desk there was a little boy copying letters . these were mr. [male] , -- commonly called sexty [male] . and his clerk , mr. [male] was a gentleman very well known and at the present moment favourably esteemed on the stock exchange .
the host , his helpers , and two watchmen who were passing . and who from the curiosity had penetrated too far into the room , were mixed up in the tumult and showered with blows . the parisians hit like cyclops , with an ensemble and a tactic delightful to behold . at length , obliged to beat a retreat before superior numbers . they formed an intrenchment behind the large table .
the work was all done at last , and ester betook herself to her room . how tired she was , every nerve seemed to quiver with weariness . it was a [female] little room . this one which she entered , with its low windows looking out toward the river . and its cosy furniture all neatly arranged by [organization] 's tasteful fingers .
he appointed the same evening , after the bank was shut and business over . for me to meet him and his friend . and indeed as soon as i saw his friend , and he began but to talk of the affair . i was fully satisfied that i had a very honest man to deal with . his countenance spoke it , and his character .
jane payland would have given a good deal to see that letter opened . but she had no excuse for remaining longer in the room . so she departed , and went to her lady 's dressing room . which , as well as all the other apartments , opened out of the corridor . in about a quarter of an hour , lady [female] 's [organization] .
the dispositions drawn up by weyrother for the battle of austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition . but still they were criticized -- criticized for their very perfection . for their excessive minuteness , [male] at the battle of borodino fulfilled his office as representative of authority as well as . and even better than , at other battles , he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle . he inclined to the most reasonable opinions , he made no confusion .
but the action was a wise one , the question as to [female] 's brewery and [male] 's beer was running high at [male] . and in no stronger way could mr. [male] have bound to him the [male] faction than by swallowing in public that pint of beer . `` let me have a small glass of brandy at once , '' said mr. [male] to his servant , having retired to his room immediately after the performance of the feat . his constitution was good , and i may as well at once declare that before half an hour had passed over his head he was again himself .
from the gay and brilliant picture of festivity which was presented but a few minutes back . what a change now came over the scene , many hurried away at once , shocked at even a momentary shadow on the sunny road of their existence . others as anxiously pressed on to recount the incident elsewhere ; some , again , moved by curiosity or some better prompting . exerted themselves to investigate what amounted to a gross violation of the etiquette of a carnival . and thus , in the salons , on the stairs , and in the court itself .
and then he quitted the subject ; and , with that guarded warmth which accompanied all his expressions . told her he would carefully watch for her honour and welfare . and , repeating his promise of endeavouring to discover the tie by which mr harrel seemed bound to the baronet . he left her -- a prey himself to an anxiety yet more severe than that with which he had filled her ! he now saw all his long cherished hopes in danger of final destruction .
having thus set and baited his trap , he proceeded to spring it . he had , in his wanderings , obtained a formula for the manufacture of spurious brandy . all that was required was a few cheap chemicals and water , he purchased the former . on pocket island there was a spring that furnished the latter . feeling sure that those whom he had duped would not dare to expose him , he yet acted cautiously and began his cheating at widely separated points .
now he could see the wall of rock all about . and on the further side and close to the wall . a large boulder , then , as his eyes grew accustomed to the semi darkness . he could see the floor formation . and as its outlines grew more distinct , he caught the gleam of white teeth grinning at him from some creature almost at his feet !
they waited breathlessly , the sound of a key being cautiously turned was presently heard . a moment after a line of white appeared beside the green paint of the door . as it was slowly and cautiously opened , then a score of things seemed to happen at once . the waiting men threw themselves into the room . the man at the end of the passage dashed out into the area .
rex reddened and hurried away from her out of the hall door . leaving her to the miserable consciousness of having made herself disagreeable in vain . he did think of her words as he rode along . they had the unwelcomeness which all unfavorable fortune telling has . even when laughed at ; but he quickly explained them as springing from little [male] 's tenderness .
he had expected that [male] would give him trouble . what he had not expected was that the trouble would have a strong element of personal feeling . and he was rather ashamed that [male] 's hopes caused him uneasiness in spite of his well warranted conviction that they would never be fulfilled . they had raised an image of [male] changing . and however he might protest that the change would not happen , the protest kept up the unpleasant image .
the man now traveled beside the sledge where the trail was rough . and rode where it was smooth and hard , the deep imprints of his heeled boots in the soft snow showed that he ran for only a short distance at a time . a hundred yards or less -- and that after each running spell he brought the pack to a walk . he was heavy and lacked endurance , and this discovery brought a low cry of exultation to jan 's lips . he fell into a dog trot , mile after mile dropped behind him .
as soon as he entered , he examined carefully whether the glass closed without leaving any trace . and , doubtless satisfied with his observation , he opened by means of a small gold key the triple fastenings of a door in front of him . this time the door opened upon a handsome cabinet . sumptuously furnished , in which was seated upon cushions a lady of surpassing beauty . who at the sound of the lock sprang towards [male] , `` ah , good heavens ! ''
the carriage was soon climbing what seemed to be a mountain to the heights above [location] . to this day i associate [location] 's most interesting city with a lonely carriage ride that seemed to be chiefly uphill . through a region that was as strange to me as a trackless jungle in the wilds of africa . and my heart began to perform strange tattoos on my ribs i was going to the house of a gentleman who did not know of my existence . to see a girl who was his guest , to whom i had never .
all [female] 's books breathe this spirit of revolt against our new enslavement by towns and machinery . and are true oases in an age so dreadfully resigned to the `` pale mechanician . '' i do not descant on his love for simple folk and simple things . his championship of the weak , and the revolt against the cagings and cruelties of life . whether to men or birds or beasts .
they went downstairs rather late , in spite of [location] 's extreme speed in getting ready . to cassandra 's ears the buzz of voices inside the drawing room was like the tuning up of the instruments of the orchestra . it seemed to her that there were numbers of people in the room . and that they were strangers , and that they were beautiful and dressed with the greatest distinction . although they proved to be mostly her relations , and the distinction of their clothing was confined .
much more to the same effect did her aunt say , discussing the subject quite artistically and unconsciously appealing to several of rose 's ruling passions . one was a love for the delicate fabrics , colors , and ornaments which refined tastes enjoy and whose costliness keeps them from ever growing common . another , her strong desire to please the eyes of those she cared for and gratify their wishes in the smallest matter if she could . and last , but not least , the natural desire of a young and pretty woman to enhance the beauty which she so soon discovers to be her most potent charm for the other sex . her passport to a high place among her maiden peers .
there was time to tell [female] but little of the woman i was going to see . mrs. [female] 's home was only a short distance from scarborough square . and before i could do more than give the briefest explanation of mrs. cotter 's condition . of her long hours of work and lack of home life . the cab had stopped , and jimmy , springing out , hopped , on his unhurt foot .
one half of it [female] saw . the blue sky , the dazzling sun . the girl in between , the pistol dropped from his limp hand . and the weight of his body tottered on the crook of his under elbow . mentally and physically he was on the point of collapse .
sir [male] to his feet . his face aflame , now , by heaven . you insolent knave ... but lord [male] checked him . placing a restraining hand upon his sleeve . and forcing him gently back into his seat , himself he now addressed the prisoner .
knowing the horse 's uncertain temper and wild disposition and taking into consideration its size . i refused to break him for ten cents . as the fact was i was rather scared of him . after considerable bargaining , in which i held out for fifty cents , we finally compromised on twenty five cents . but i can assure you it was more for the money than the fun of the thing .
her mind dwelt for a few moments on the picture of herself losing her youth and ceasing to enjoy . not minding whether she did this or that : but such picturing inevitably brought back the image of her mother . poor mamma , it will be still worse for her now , i can get a little money for her . that is all i shall care about now , and then with an entirely new movement of her imagination . she saw her mother getting quite old and white .
sir , said [male] cote male taile . i beseech you let me enter within this fortress . and if i may speed well i will send for you , and if it happened that i be slain . there it goeth , and if so be that i am a prisoner taken , then may ye rescue me . i am loath , said sir [male] , to let you pass this passage .
what was it ? not the shape , certainly , for he was a pleasant looking man from earliest youth . broad bowed with gray eyes that were [male] and friendly , yet i have heard him tell a room full of reporters angling for a `` success '' story that he would be ashamed to tell them the truth that they would not believe it . that it was not one story but four , that the public would not want to read about a man who had been walloped into prominence . it all started at [male] andover academy when he was fourteen . he had been brought up on a diet of caviar and bell boys
this was said upon the evening of the first gathering upon miss [female] 's grass plat . and at the same time it was prophesied that mr. [male] barold would soon go away . but neither of the prophecies proved true , mr. [male] barold did not return to [location] . and , strange to say , [female] was seen again and again playing croquet with octavia [organization] . and was even known to spend evenings with her , perhaps it might be that an appeal made by miss [female] to her ladyship had caused her to allow of these things .
downstairs on the landing she was soon surrounded . lady blakeney never stepped from any house into her coach . without an escort of fluttering human moths around the dazzling light of her beauty . but before she finally turned away from chauvelin , she held out a tiny hand to him . with that pretty gesture of childish appeal which was essentially her own , give me some hope .
for they were now inclosed in a vault strewn with the dead bodies of the murdered . and must there become the victims of famine , or of the sword . the earth was in several places thrown up , and marked the boundaries of new made graves . the bodies which remained unburied were probably left either from hurry or negligence . and exhibited a spectacle too shocking for humanity , the sufferings of hippolitus were increased by those of [male] .
at any rate the upshot was that the good horse went back to stable . and had another feed of corn , while my wrath sank within me . there are two things , according to my experience ( which may not hold with another man ) . fitted beyond any others to take hot tempers out of us . the first is to see our favourite creatures feeding , and licking up their food .
the footman ( who had as many large buttons with the [male] crest upon them on the flaps of his pockets . as if he were the family strong box . and carried the plate and jewels about with him buttoned up ) . pondered over the card a little ; then said , `` walk in , '' it required some judgment to do it without butting the inner hall door open . and in the consequent mental confusion and physical darkness slipping down the kitchen stairs .
for answer , [location] raised the scissors . and gave a snip , it was a savage snip . and half the length and width of her love locks fell on the mantle . then she gave another snip , and the other half fell . for a moment [location] stood gazing at herself .
iseult put down the sword and taking up the coat of arms she saw upon it the hair of gold and was silent a long space . till she kissed him on the lips to prove [female] . and she put rich garments over him . on the day of the barons assembly . tristan sent perinis privily to his ship to summon his companions that they should come to court adorned as befitted the envoys of a great king .
there were assembled all the epicureans who so lately at [male] had done the honors of the mansion of wit and money in aid of [male] . joyous friends , for the most part faithful . they had not fled their protector at the approach of the storm . and , in spite of the threatening heavens . in spite of the trembling earth , they remained there .
he reached and touched the dead face , and the sharp , heavy bruise of ice bruised his living bowels . he wondered if he himself were freezing too . freezing from the inside , in the short blond moustache the life breath was frozen into a block of ice . beneath the silent nostrils , and this was [male] , again he touched the sharp . almost glittering fair hair of the frozen body , it was icy cold .
two hours later , [female] was seated in an inner room or boudoir of a handsome apartment in the via sistina . but this stupendous fragmentariness heightened the dreamlike strangeness of her bridal life . [female] had now been five weeks in [female] . and in the kindly mornings when autumn and winter seemed to go hand in hand like a happy aged couple one of whom would presently survive in chiller loneliness . she had driven about at first with mr. [male] .
yes ; done , and done , and done , besides , a man in your position in the county should always marry a wife younger than yourself . a good deal younger , [organization] did not understand the argument . but he liked the allusion to his position in the county . and he perceived that it was too late for any changes in the present arrangements . but he was happy ; and all that feeling of animosity to [male] had vanished from his breast , poor [female] !
oliver considered the woman for a long moment as she sat half crouching on the divan . her hands locked , her face set and stony . her eyes lowered , he sighed gently and turned away , he paced to the parapet and looked out upon the city bathed in the white glare of the full risen moon . there arose thence a hum of sound . dominated , however , by the throbbing song of a nightingale somewhere in his garden and the croaking of the frogs by the pool in the valley .
could she be the same herself ? she reached over for a hand glass to look at her face . as she took it off the table . it slipped from the tips of her fingers . and , falling face downwards , it broke . she had a momentary pang at that accident as at a bad omen .
you may have shown your usual good sense in conducting your affairs on monday . tuesday , and wednesday in the week . but it does not at all follow from this , that you may not make a fool of yourself on thursday . account for it as you may . for a much longer time than it suits my self esteem to reckon up .
this was how [male] felt , while [male] was scattering at his feet the treasures of a disinterested affection . he had been vain and selfish from boyhood , and his vices grew stronger with increasing years . his nature was hardened , and not chastened , by the trials and disappointments which had befallen him . in the hour of his poverty and degradation it had been a triumph for him to win the devotion of a woman whom many men . men better than himself -- had loved in vain .
in these latter years , when progress is the watchword of the railroads in common with the other industries of the country . no expense or pains are spared by the railroad people to add to the comfort . enjoyments , safety and convenience of the traveling public . until now it is about as safe to travel as it is to stay at home . and not much if any more expensive , but in spite of all safeguards adopted by the railroads a wreck occurs once in a while the same as accidents occur at home .
i was paying little attention to jimmy , at the open window i could see a young girl across the street with a baby in her arms . she had brought it from a small frame house with high steps leading to a sagging porch . in the door of which a large and kindly faced woman was standing , arms folded and eyes watching the movements of the girl . as the latter lifted her head , on which was no hat . i leaned forward , my heart in my throat .
so in her parlor i sat and told her how it was with [male] and how greatly he desired to see her . and as i spoke of his longing i turned my eyes away from her . because she was sitting on a sofa , upholstered in velveteen of a sickish green . which was so low that her knees stuck up in front of her . and she had to clasp them with her seamed , floury hands .
lady [female] courcy had declared that she was looking extremely well . and had particularly alluded to her distingue appearance , [female] at once felt that he could not altogether go along with his aunt in this opinion . miss dunstable might be very well ; but her style of beauty was one which did not quite meet with his warmest admiration . in age she was about thirty . but [male] , who was no great judge in these matters .
elinor then said that she would hurry home . and send off the same elegant machine from the farm , which , she found . had been made use of in her service the preceding day . far from exhilarated was the young person whom she left , who , thus treated . could scarcely brook the permission to return , which before she would have solicited , small are the circumstances which reverse all our wishes !
the whole barricade fired , the report was terrible ; an avalanche of smoke covered and effaced both cannon and men . after a few seconds , the cloud dispersed , and the cannon and men re appeared . the gun crew had just finished rolling it slowly , correctly , without haste . into position facing the barricade , not one of them had been struck . then the captain of the piece , bearing down upon the breech in order to raise the muzzle .
the people of the country view them with surprise and curiosity . whence come these strange faces ? yonder mountain . smoking with revolutionary fires , casts them out , these barren aërolites . these famished and ruined people , these footballs of destiny . are known as refugees , emigres , adventurers . if they sojourn among strangers .
by the cigars they smoke , and the composers they love . ye shall know the texture of men 's souls . old jolyon could not bear a strong cigar or [male] 's music . he loved [male] and [male] . handel and gluck , and [male] .
my portrait now reposes next to nikhil 's , for are not the two of [male] old friends ? i was never self-conscious , but nowadays i often try to take an outside view . to see myself as bimal sees me . what a dismally solemn picture it makes , my habit of taking things too seriously ! better , surely , to laugh away the world than flood it with tears .
mr. [male] was a good deal more surprised and discomfited than she . instead of a quiet , middle-aged clergyman , a young lady came forward with [male] dignity . a young lady of a different type to most of those he was in the habit of seeing . her dress was very plain : a close straw bonnet of the best material and shape . trimmed with white ribbon ; a dark silk gown .
revolvers are tricky things for young hands to deal with . maisie could not explain how it had happened , but a veil of reeking smoke separated her from [female] . and she was quite certain that the pistol had gone off in his face . then she heard him sputter . and dropped on her knees beside him .
then they of cornwall let make cries in every place . that what knight would fight for to save the truage of cornwall , he should be rewarded so that he should fare the better . term of his life , then some of the barons said to king mark . and counselled him to send to the court of king [male] for to seek sir [male] lake . that was that time named for the marvelloust knight of all the world .
`` ah , not soon , i hope , '' i exclaimed with genuine feeling . i had perfectly considered the possibility that she would destroy her papers on the day she should feel her end really approach . i believed that she would cling to them till then . and i think i had an idea that she read aspern 's letters over every night or at least pressed them to her withered lips . i would have given a good deal to have a glimpse of the latter spectacle .
she had also another task to perform -- that , namely , of persuading him to employ an attorney for his defence . and she was prepared with the name of an attorney . one mr. [female] , also of [female] . who had been recommended to her by mr. [female] , but when she came to the performance of these two tasks on the monday morning . she found that she was unable to accomplish either of them .
mrs. fain , mirabell , there 's a necessity for your obedience . you have neither time to talk nor stay , my mother is coming . and in my conscience if she should see you . would fall into fits , and maybe not recover time enough to return to sir rowland . who , as foible tells me , is in a fair way to succeed .
the story went , after a while , that [male] had been refused . and was taking his refusal badly , reporters saw him . carelessly dressed , outside the stage door waiting . and the story went that the girl had thrown him over . money and all , for her leading man , one thing was clear .
so when the duke and his wife were come unto the king . by the means of great lords they were accorded both . the king liked and loved this lady well , and he made them great cheer out of measure . and desired to have lain by her , but she was a passing good woman . and would not assent unto the king , and then she told the duke her husband .
when i go about something definite . i can do it : -- to ride , or read aloud to the old people . or sit down at meals with them is very easy ; but i can not make employment for myself . that requires too much effort of invention and will : and i have only will for one thing in life . to get through it : and no invention to the purpose .
so far as [male] was concerned , this appearance of ease was assumed . three times that afternoon he had dressed himself in a tail coat . and three times he had discarded it for an old dressing gown . three times he had placed his pearl tie pin in position . and three times he had removed it again .
it was one of the happiest afternoons he had ever spent . but it tired him and he was glad to sit down in the music room and let her give him tea . a special little friend of holly 's had come in -- a fair child with short hair like a boy 's . and the two sported in the distance , under the stairs , on the stairs . and up in the gallery , old jolyon begged for chopin .
[male] gently withdrew his arm and , rising , strode across to a table on which was a decanter of whisky and syphon of soda . with unsteady hands , he poured whisky and soda into a glass and . returning to patricia , he passed his arm gently behind her head . placing the glass against her lips , she drank a little and then . with a shudder , turned her head aside , a moment later her eyes opened again .
a strand of cord , a tangled skein . a bolt rope , a thread in the hem of a sail . all around was the lamentable work of demolition , nothing remained that was not unhooked . unnailed , cracked , wasted , warped , pierced with holes , destroyed : nothing hung together in the dreadful mass . but all was torn , dislocated , broken , there was that air of drift which characterises the scene of all struggles .
so they returned to the osiers , leslie pondered deeply a few seconds . then resolutely putting [female] , she began cutting armloads of pale yellow osiers . finding a suitable place to work , she swiftly and deftly selected perfect . straight evenly coloured ones , cutting them the same length . then binding the tip ends firmly with raffia she had brought to substitute for grass .
she stopt , and the deepest vermillion overspread her face . her effort was made ; she had boasted of her new doctrine . lest she should seem impressed with confusion from the old one which she violated . but the struggle being over , the bravado and exultation subsided . female consciousness and native shame took their place .
on reaching home [male] found [male] waiting for him . a month of fever could not have changed her more than this one night of sleeplessness and sorrow . do not depend upon me , madame , for the next meeting . since my convalescence i have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that i am forced to regulate them a little . when your turn comes , i shall have the honor to inform you of it .
the state of mind into which mr [male] 's dazed lady had fallen . had now begun to be so expressed in all her looks and actions that she was held in very low account by the two clever ones . as a person , never of strong intellect , who was becoming foolish , perhaps because her appearance was not of a commercial cast . or perhaps because it occurred to him that his having taken her to wife might expose his judgment to doubt in the minds of customers . mr [male] laid his commands upon her that she should hold her [female] on the subject of her conjugal relations .
`` yes , '' replied mr. [male] , folding his arms and looking full at his kinsman . with an ominous smile upon his face , -- yes ; the fact is a little too evident for the basis of an argument . i have come back , mr. [male] was silent for a minute or so . the younger man stood with his back against the angle of the embayed window . and he never took his eyes from his friend 's face .
it was a very dark evening for summer . the clouds appeared inclined to thunder , and i said we had better all sit down . the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home without further trouble . however , [male] would not be persuaded into tranquillity , she kept wandering to and fro . from the gate to the door , in a state of agitation which permitted no repose .
he had stared for a little at the outside painted a good cream colour . with two peacock blue tubs containing little bay trees in a recessed doorway . and at the words `` restaurant bretagne '' above them in gold letters . rather favourably impressed , entering , he had noticed that several people were already seated at little round green tables with little pots of fresh flowers on them and brittany ware plates . and had asked of a trim waitress to see the proprietor , they had shown him into a back room .
to give herself a countenance she held out owen 's letter . he took it and glanced down the page . his face grown grave , she waited nervously till he looked up . `` that 's a good plan ; the best thing that could happen , '' he said . a just perceptible shade of constraint in his tone .
it is the first anniversary of the happy marriage of mr and mrs [female] . and the celebration is a breakfast , because a dinner on the desired scale of sumptuosity can not be achieved within less limits than those of the non-existent palatial residence of which so many people are madly envious . so , [male] trips with not a little stiffness across piccadilly , sensible of having once been more upright in figure and less in danger of being knocked down by swift vehicles . to be sure that was in the days when he hoped for leave from the dread [male] to do something . or be something , in life , and before that magnificent tartar issued the ukase .
stepping out of sight , we saw the poor lady pass through the quiet . empty house into the children 's bed room . we heard her smothered sob . at times , the whole way , then i went down to the stream . and helped [male] to saddle his horse , with mrs. [female] 's old saddle .
it 's not a nice name , [male] . i am ugly too . ai not i ? but , you are certainly plain , [male] , and i am three cornered too . ai not i ? but , you are rather triangular , [male] , ha ! ha ! that 's it , i am ugly , and they hate me for it . for you all hate me , do not you , all , we do , [male] , there , boat .
of course , she had endeavoured from time to time to learn all that was to be learned from her husband . sometimes he would be almost communicative to her ; at other times she could get hardly a word from him . but , through it all , he gave her to believe that she would have to go . nor did her father make any great effort to turn his mind the other way . if it must be so , of what use would be such false kindness on his part ?
whatever she wore , people felt the charm of her active . girlish body with its slender hips and quick , eager shoulders . [male] heard little of the story . but he watched [male] intently , she must certainly . he reflected , be thirty , and he was honestly delighted to see that the years had treated her so indulgently .
he had encountered some failure in the performance of the slight clerical task allotted to him . and the dean had tenderly advised him to desist , he did not utter one word of remonstrance . it will perhaps be better , the dean had said , yes , . it will be better , mr. [male] had replied . few have had accorded to them the high privilege of serving their master in his house for so many years .
mrs. [female] could think of no other question . and [female] and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed . [female] had already sent to say , that she should eat nothing more . mrs. [female] 's and [female] 's appetites were equally lost . and [female] might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced .
the bell rang , [male] and his friend shook hands in silence for the last time . and in the next moment [male] ran down the steps to the little steamer which had brought them out to the larger vessel . the sails spread wide in the cool evening wind . and the mighty ship glided away into the dusk . [male] 's last look showed him his friend 's face gazing down upon him over the bulwarks full of trust and affection .
they had begun to fail him before he entered the house . and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of mrs. [male] . indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters . without extending the passion to her ; and [male] had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself . his affections seemed to reanimate towards them all .
and the monster laughed so loudly and hideously that we could no longer distinguish christine 's supplicating cries ! the [male] chagny shouted and banged against the walls like a madman . i could not restrain him , but we heard nothing except the monster 's laughter . and the monster himself can have heard nothing else . and then there was the sound of a body falling on the floor and being dragged along and a door slammed and then nothing .
`` your family appears to be a very happy one , '' said the count . as if speaking to himself , [male] had scarcely finished his story . during which the count 's heart had swelled within him . when emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat . he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest .
thereupon he walked heavily up the stairs . the old man 's forbearance was perhaps not the least part of [female] punishment . she gathered the rest of his presents together . packed them carefully in a box , fastened the box . addressed it and carried it down to the hall .
the innkeeper declared that he really wanted to go to oakbourne , and might as well go to night . he should have all monday before him then . [male] , after making an ineffectual attempt to eat , put the food in his pocket . and , drinking a draught of ale , declared himself ready to set off . as they approached the cottage , it occurred to him that he would do well to learn from the old woman where dinah was to be found in leeds .
the next morning he saw [male] pass and repass . holding an enormous bouquet , which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle . this belief was changed into certainty when [organization] saw the bouquet ( conspicuous by a circle of white camellias ) . in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose colored satin . the evening was no longer joy , but delirium .
the rector of the parish , the rev . [male] , had become rich , his uncle , the magnificent dean ofasaph . had just died in [location] , the news had been brought by the mail sloop . the cashmere , arrived from england that very morning . and the mast of which could be perceived in the roads ofpeter 's port .
it certainly did seem to mrs. [female] that [female] knew a good deal about mr. [male] . she knew of his kith and kin . she knew of his prospects and what was like to mar his prospects . and she knew also of his immediate proceedings , whereabouts , and intentions . mrs. [female] did not logically draw any conclusion from these premises .
[male] and [male] still talked on in the same style . he , half serious and half jesting . maintaining the scheme for the play , and she . invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that . however determined to go to [female] place herself .
he was a handsome , lazy , care for nothing fellow , of about seven and twenty . the only son of a younger brother of sir [male] . his father had left him £400 a year . which his friends had advised him to increase by being called to the bar . and as he found it , after due consideration .
of all the bewildering things about a new country , the absence of human landmarks is one of the most depressing and disheartening . the houses on the divide were small and were usually tucked away in low places . you did not see them until you came directly upon them . most of them were built of the sod itself . and were only the unescapable ground in another form , the roads were but faint tracks in the grass .
she had read of persons who had been shut up alive in cells in the wall . and starved to death , with dilating eyes she watched the senora . who , all unaware of her terror , was prolonging it and intensifying it by her every act . first she took out the small iron box . and set it on a table , then , kneeling , she drew out from an inner recess in the closet a large leather covered box .
it had blocked his acceptance of the church . it blocked his acceptance of tess . moreover , his affection itself was less fire than radiance . and , with regard to the other sex , when he ceased to believe he ceased to follow . contrasting in this with many impressionable natures , who remain sensuously infatuated with what they intellectually despise .
mr [male] , with a modest disavowal of his merits . opened the room door for her readmission . and followed her in with such an exceedingly bald pretence of not having been out at all . that her father might have observed it without being very suspicious , in his affable unconsciousness . however , he took no heed , [male] , after a little conversation .
the minute hand moved on , the pistols were loaded . he stretched forth his hand , took one up . and murmured his daughter 's name , then he laid it down seized his pen . and wrote a few words , it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter . then he turned again to the clock , counting time now not by minutes .
standing now , close to the gateway of his mother 's house . he looked down the street : but it was empty . there was no projecting shadow large enough to obscure the man ; there was no turning near that he could have taken . nor had there been any audible sound of the opening and closing of a door . nevertheless , he concluded that the man must have had a key in his hand .
when he awoke , -- late , as he had said , but refreshed and jubilant . the revelation he must make seemed to him less formidable . and he was minded to make it with no more delay as he tossed over his mail . while breakfasting in his room , `` ah , what is this ? '' a letter in his wife 's hand . bearing the liverpool postmark , was she on her way to him , then ?
lo , there my boon , what other ? for men sought to prove me vile . because i fain had given them greater wits . and then did envy call me devil 's son . the sick weak beast seeking to help herself by striking at her better , missed , and brought her own claw back . and wounded her own heart , sweet were the days when i was all unknown .
[female] , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation . now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from [female] herself . and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir [male] . in which she was readily joined by [female] , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match . the excellent character of mr. [male] .
with a bound i cleared the prostrate form of mahomed . as i flew over him i felt the heat from the red hot pot . which was lying close by , strike upon my legs , and by its glow saw his hands . for he was not quite dead -- still feebly moving , at the top of the cave was a little platform of rock three feet or so high by about eight deep . on which two large lamps were placed at night , whether this platform had been left as a seat .
then his venerable , white head fell forward on the bed , that stoical old heart broke . his face was engulfed , so to speak , in cosette 's garments . and if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment , he would have heard frightful sobs . the old and formidable struggle , of which we have already witnessed so many phases . began once more , [male] struggled with the angel but one night , alas !
the [male] ranch buildings were more than a mile away from the point where [male] and the sheriff halted to look down on them . the ranchhouse was a structure of logs from which the bark had been stripped . and which had weathered white as bones , it was long and low , suggesting spaciousness and comfort . and enclosed about by a white picket fence , a winding trace of trees and brushwood marked the course of the stream that ran behind it . on the brink of this little water , where it flashed free of the tangled willows .
for the second time that morning the squire looked up with the sharp and searching gaze he occasionally assumed . and for the second time his instinct , for he was too heady a man to reason overmuch . came into play and warned him that in making this offer [male] had other motives than those which he had brought forward . he paused to consider what they might be , was he anxious to get the estate for himself ? was he put forward by somebody else ? [male] , perhaps .
again he embraced and kissed prince [male] . but before the latter had left the room kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished novel . les chevaliers [male] cygne by madame [male] genlis . on such feelings , more or less dimly shared by all , the unanimity and general approval were founded with which . despite court influences , the popular choice of kutuzov as commander in chief was received .
[female] purse was of no use to [male] mabeuf . [male] mabeuf , in his venerable , infantile austerity . had not accepted the gift of the stars ; he had not admitted that a star could coin itself into [male] d'or . he had not divined that what had fallen from heaven had come from gavroche . he had taken the purse to the police commissioner of the quarter .
chapter ii , how uther [organization] made war on the duke of cornwall . and how by the mean of [male] he lay by the duchess and gat [male] . chapter v. how [male] was chosen king . and of wonders and marvels of a sword taken out of a stone by the said [male] , chapter xi . of a great tourney made by king [male] and the two kings ban and [male] .
monsieur [female] traveled , then , pretty easily upon furet , who ambled like a true butter woman 's pad . and who , with his amble , managed cheerfully about twelve leagues a day . upon four spindle shanks , of which the practiced eye of [male] had appreciated the strength and safety beneath the thick mass of hair which covered them . jogging along , the traveler took notes , studied the country . which he traversed reserved and silent , ever seeking the most plausible pretext for reaching belle ile en mer .
mrs. [female] can not be accused of giving [female] much information about life . and [female] , on the other hand , has made a fair show of modesty . and has pretended to an inexperience that she certainly did not feel , she had kept house for over ten years . she had entertained , almost with distinction ; she had brought up a charming sister . and was bringing up a brother , surely , if experience is attainable , she had attained it .
was this singularly casual encounter , then , but a cloak for further surveillance ? had he in his haste and desperation simply played into her hands . when he burdened himself with the care of her ? but it seemed absurd ; to think that she ... a girl like her . whose every word and gesture was eloquent of gentle birth and training .., !
when [female] expressed to his father an opinion that courcy castle was dull . the squire , as may be remembered , did not pretend to differ from him . to men such as the squire , and such as the squire 's son . courcy castle was dull , to what class of men it would not be dull the author is not prepared to say . but it may be presumed that the [male] courcys found it to their liking .
he believed he was safe , for the unceasing wind and the blasts of shot like snow filled his tracks a few moments after they were made . he struck a straight line for his cabin after that first day and night in the scrub timber . the storm was still a thing of terrific force out on the barren . but in the timber he was fairly well sheltered , he was convinced the police patrol would find his cabin very soon after the storm had worn itself out . porter and tavish did not trouble him .
so she put on her straw bonnet and walked up with [female] . everybody about the place had already heard the news . the old woman at the lodge curtsied low to her ; the gardener . who was mowing the lawn , the [male] , who opened the front door . he must have been watching [male] 's approach .
swiftly mr. [male] made up his mind , gentlemen , that is a good suggestion . i make it a motion , it was seconded in a dozen places . and carried by a standing vote , then ranald rose again and modestly protested that he was not the man to go . he was quite unknown in the province , `` we know you ! '' the same voice called out , followed by a roar of approval .
it is easy to see how i came to learn so much of the war . and of the places where it raged , for old schwartz was proud of his knowledge . and read to [male] and drew maps , and we had nothing else to talk about . the village was very still , and people from the nearest town talked only of the war and of those who had left them . ours is a quiet place with romantic scenes around it .
he had been invited by the countess [female] courcy to join her suite at courcy castle . his special friend , montgomerie dobbs , had a place in [location] . and then there was a yachting party by which he was much wanted , but mr crosbie had as yet knocked himself down to none of these biddings . having before him when he left [location] no other fixed engagement than that which took him to allington . on the first of october we shall also find ourselves at allington in company with [male] .
so , too , was the door of [male] 's chamber and that of the park . from the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow . he saw that these tracks tended toward the wall . on the other side he found similar tracks . then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of enghien .
so true is this that it is difficult to determine whether social practices called forth the literature . or whether , as in the case of the seventeenth century pastoral romance in [location] . it is truer to say that literature suggested to society its ideals . be that as it may , it is proper to observe that the french romances of adventure portray late mediaeval aristocracy as it fain would be . for the glaring inconsistencies between the reality and the ideal .
yet , it was not his quarrel ; he could not interfere on one side or the other without drawing down the displeasure of somebody . nor as a neutral without incurring the wrath of both , this view of it did not relieve him of anxiety to know how the matter was going to terminate . he gave [male] the reins and galloped after [male] . who was already over the hill , as he rode he began to realize as never before the smallness of this fence cutting feud . the really worthless bone at the bottom of the contention .
[male] picked up the flowers , and freshening his eyes . red with tears , against them , smelt them delicately . she took them quickly from his hand and put them in a glass of water . the next day madame bovary senior arrived , she and her son wept much . emma , on the pretext of giving orders , disappeared .
the audience cleared their throats and tossed a few stalks into the fire . not because these deeds were urgent , but to give themselves time to weigh the moral of the story . `` i am sure when i heard they would been forbid i felt as glad as if anybody had gied me sixpence , '' said an earnest voice -- that of olly dowden , a woman who lived by making heath brooms , or besoms . her nature was to be civil to enemies as well as to friends .
they were down below when this story was told , sitting on their portmanteaus in the little cabin in which they were to sleep . the prospect of the journey certainly had no attraction for mr. [male] . his companion was most distasteful to him ; the ship was abominable . the expense was most severe , how glad would he avoid it all if it were possible ! `` you know it all as well as if you were there , ''
my lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford . corrupted the simplicity of his life , and [male] his [male] with anxieties and regrets . i was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the [male] family to the poor arts they practised . because such littlenesses were their natural bent , and would have been evoked by anybody else . if i had left them slumbering , but [male] 's was a very different case .
but luckily the horse galloped right on without any need for swimming . being himself excited , no doubt , by all he had seen and heard of it . and jeremy lay almost flat on his neck , so as to give little space for good aim . with the mane tossing wildly in front of him . now if that young fellow with the gun had his brains as ready as his flint was .
[male] jerked his thumb in the direction of the [location] . for which the motor boat was making , as they reached her the two men nimbly climbed up the side and . [female] leading , dived below to the office of works . as they entered blake was sitting exactly as [male] had left him an hour and a half previously . at the sight of grant his eyes seemed to flash ; but he made no movement except to hold out his hand .
`` by jove you are about right , '' said calder [male] . the reader will therefore readily see that mr [organization] the banker reigned as king in that club . vavasor had sent two horses on in charge of bat smithers . and followed on a pony about fourteen hands high , which he had ridden as a cover hack for the last four years . he did not start till near ten .
it is extraordinary to think how forty eight hours had turned this amazing . sexless creature into a woman , the problem of a dinner dress was solved for her almost at once by jocelyn himself . as soon as they were safely back at maple 's he asked her if she really wanted to dine with the halbertons at the shelbourne . and when she said , `` of course , '' he produced a five pound note from the pigskin case that he carried in his coat tail . and turned her loose in grafton street , an hour later she returned .
the other 's exclamation jarred on him , rotten , having to talk about this sort of thing ! oblivious , therefore , to the storm raging a yard away from him . he smoked on with great contentment , till suddenly it struck him that . for a presumably devout lover , jilted that very night . he was displaying too little emotion , he debated swiftly within himself whether or not he should have a dash at manly grief .
the judge had got his prize in life . and was therefore personally indifferent to the fate of ministers ; but the judge 's wife had a brother who wanted a county court from lord [male] terrier . and it was known that [male] was giving valuable assistance towards the attainment of this object . `` i do think that you and mr. [male] are so right , '' said the judge 's wife . [male] , who understood how it came to pass that the judge 's wife should so cordially approve his conduct .
the result of the conversation was that the mr. [male] mentioned above received the next day a call from a stranger . who made particular inquiry about little [male] , he seemed satisfied with the result . and as he had before learned that mr. [male] was a very good . honest man , he handed him five hundred dollar . telling him to take [female] home .
then perceval cried in prayer for aid . and asked that if [male] would have this land saved for his glory . strength should be given him to slay this fiendish oppressor . forthwith strength seemed to nerve his arm mightily , and lifting his sword he struck at the shield of the knight . and so vehement was the blow that he cut down the shield even to the head of the dragon .
this strongylion left but two statues which placed [male] and brutus in accord . brutus was in love with the one , [male] with the other . all history is nothing but wearisome repetition . one century is the plagiarist of the other , the battle of marengo copies the battle of pydna . the tolbiac of clovis and the austerlitz of [male] are as like each other as two drops of water .
it stands amid a multitude of trim gardens and stone built terraces . divided one from another : these to our eyes are not so attractive as that broad expanse of lawn by which our country houses are generally surrounded . but the gardens of greshamsbury have been celebrated for two centuries . and any gresham who would have altered them would have been considered to have destroyed one of the well-known landmarks of the family . greshamsbury park -- properly so called -- spread far away on the other side of the village .
gradually the reception room filled , and some of our old friends made their appearance . we mean debray , chateau renaud , and beauchamp , accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar . in literature , or the army , for [male] villefort moved in the first parisian circles . less owing to his social position than to his personal merit , the [male] standing at the door ushered in the guests . and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves .
the good hope , as we have said , was anchored far out , where the swell was heaviest . no other vessel lay nearer than several cables length ; those that were the nearest were themselves entirely deserted . and as the skiff approached , a thick flurry of snow and a sudden darkening of the weather further concealed the movements of the outlaws from all possible espial . in a trice they had leaped upon the heaving deck . and the skiff was dancing at the stern , the good hope was captured .
she blushed and laughed excitedly as she gave emil her hand . and looked delightedly at the [male] velvet coat that brought out his fair skin and fine blond head . [female] was incapable of being lukewarm about anything that pleased her . she simply did not know how to give a half hearted response , when she was delighted . she was as likely as not to stand on her tip toes and clap her hands .
he had learned from them something more of her glories and beauties . and remembering what he had seen of her , adored her the more . he leaned back now , shading his eyes from the candles upon the table . and began to sing his love and his queen , he told of new insults that had been put upon her . new deprivations of what was left to her of liberty ; he did not speak now of [male] by name .
monsieur would recall to himself that there were the refuges to visit . and that tracks had to be made to them also , [male] still urged . on the other hand , that the space was so -- ha -- hum . so very contracted , more than that , it was always the same , always the same . with a deprecating smile , the host gently raised and gently lowered his shoulders .
he threw off his coat and hat . filled his pipe , and began gathering up his few possessions , ready for packing . it was noon before he was through , and gregson had not returned . he boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait . at five o'clock he was to eat supper with the brokaws and the factor .
weeks passed , and never a word that she dreaded from maya the queen . the women of dwaymenau , questioning the queen 's women . heard that she seemed to have heavy sorrow upon her . her eyes were like dying lamps and she faded as they . the king never entered her palace .
incoherent sounds rattled in his throat , and then , overcome by his effort . he dropped back unconscious , [male] wound his handkerchief about the wounded man 's head and straightened out his limbs . then he rose to his feet and reloaded his revolver . his hands were steady now , his brain was clear ; the enervating thrill of excitement had gone from his body . only his heart beat like a racing engine .
when the first emotion of the scene was passed , [male] enquired by what means [male] had come to this spot . he answered her generally , and avoided for the present entering upon the affecting subject of the late events at the castle of [female] . [female] related the history of her adventures since she parted with her brother . in her narration , it appeared that hippolitus . who was taken by the duke [female] luovo at the mouth of the cave .
when the old lady reached the station she found . to her dismay , that her train had just gone and that she would have to wait two hours for the evening one . she went into the waiting room and sat down , she was very tired . all the excitement that had sustained her was gone , and she felt weak and old . she had nothing to eat , having expected to get home in time for tea .
dead ? certainly he was not dead , he did not believe that any one had said that he was dead ! she might be lying or not , -- he did not care ; he , peacocke . certainly had lied ; -- so said the colonel , he did not believe that peacocke had ever seen his brother [male] was dead . must have been dead , indeed , before the date given for that interview , the woman was a bigamist . that is , if any second marriage had ever been perpetrated , probably both had wilfully agreed to the falsehood .
the burly barrister tried all he knew , but he could make nothing of this witness . a question was asked him , the true answer to which would have implied that his sister 's life had been disreputable . when this was asked [male] declared that he would not say a word about his sister one way or the other . his sister had told them all she knew about the murder . and now he had told them all he knew .
he bowed and pointed with his hat to the smouldering fire a short distance ahead . they had turned a bend in the overhanging cliff . and were very close to the retreat before she saw the glow . the fire was in the open air and directly in front of a deep cleft in the rocky background . judging by the sound , the river could not be more than two hundred feet away .
our company of artists sat on the fallen column . the pagan altar , and the steps of the [male] shrine . enjoying the moonlight and shadow , the present gayety and the gloomy reminiscences of the scene . in almost equal share , artists , indeed , are lifted by the ideality of their pursuits a little way off the earth . and are therefore able to catch the evanescent fragrance that floats in the atmosphere of life above the heads of the ordinary crowd .
a short , fat man , with a flat face , a cranium ornamented with a crown of gray hairs . cut short , in imitation of a tonsure , and covered with an old [male] velvet cap . arose as soon as he heard [male] -- we ought not to say arose . but bounded up , in fact , [male] bounded up , carrying with him his little low chair . which the children tried to take away , with battles more fierce than those of the greeks endeavoring to recover the body of patroclus from the hands of the trojans .
for it has been discovered , and is now well established , that the lonely inhabitant of the rock is not a saint . but a devil , this evil spirit , whose name is jochmus . had the impudence to pass himself off , for many centuries . as saint maclou , even the church herself is not proof against snares of this kind . the demons raguhel , oribel , and tobiel , were regarded as saints until the year 745 .
before rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance of that firing . count ostermann tolstoy 's adjutant came galloping from vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road . the squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery . which had also quickened their pace -- rode down a hill , and passing through an empty and deserted village again ascended . the horses began to lather and the men to flush , `` halt ! dress your ranks ! ''
in the meantime the money thus obtained enabled him to float on . he paid his hotel bill , and removed to lodgings in one of the narrow streets to the north east of tottenham court road . an obscure lodging enough , where he had a couple of comfortable rooms on the first floor . and where his going out and coming in attracted little notice , here , as at the hotel . he chose to assume the name of [male] instead of his legitimate cognomen .
i was resolved to try my strength against the strength of the elements . and try it i did , ay , and proved it . a certain fierce delight burned in me , as the struggle grew harder . but rather would i die than yield ; and at last i finished it . people talk of it to this day .
and now he had passed under the little arch between the eighth and the ninth emperor . rounded the sheldonian , and been lost to sight of katie , whom , as he was equally glad and sorry he had kissed her . he was able to dismiss from his mind , another farewell look he gave to the old vast horse chestnut that is called bishop [male] 's tree . certainly , no : there was no general rule , with its towering and bulging masses of verdure tricked out all over in their annual finery of catkins . bishop [male] 's tree stood for the very type of ingenuous ostentation .
i was restless and in no mood for bed and mourned the lack of variety in my grandfather 's library . i moved about from shelf to shelf , taking down one book after another . and while thus engaged came upon a series of large volumes extra illustrated in water colors of unusual beauty . they occupied a lower shelf , and i sprawled on the floor . like a boy with a new picture book , in my absorption .
he was ejecting this other man because he possessed none of these attributes . he hurried himself on to add that the man must be of good character . and such as a young girl might learn to love , but yet he was aware that he added these things for his conscience 's sake . [male] 's character was good , and certainly the girl loved him . but was it not clear to all who knew anything of such matters that mr. [male] should not have dared even to think of marrying the daughter of the duke of omnium ?
some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right ; that he intended to be civil . in his way , and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience . and the mob retired , the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took [male] by the hands and began examining his person . attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere [male] .
peter tried to answer , and thumped his tail , but even as he asked the questions there was a doubt growing in jolly [male] 's mind . he wanted to go back , and as darkness gathered about him he was urged by a great loneliness . only yellow bird grieved with him in his loss of nada . and understood how empty life had become for him , she had . in a way , become a part of nada .
with a shrug adrian turned from him ; this time his eyes met his [male] 's and held them . allard caught his breath ; clearly it stood out in his memory . that night when adrian had sent for him near midnight . `` sleep , read , do what you like , but stay where i can see you , '' had been the curt command , and when dawn had opened grayly across the city .
the two tall peasants had their say , as soon as rostov . followed by ilyin , lavrushka , and alpatych , came up to the crowd . karp , thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little . walked to the front , [male] on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together . `` who is your elder here ? hey ? '' shouted rostov .
now all this while my good old nurse , mrs. [female] . and all the rest of them did not understand me at all . for they meant one sort of thing by the word gentlewoman . and i meant quite another ; for alas , all i understood by being a gentlewoman was to be able to work for myself . and get enough to keep me without that terrible bugbear going to service .
allard had yet to learn his stanief ; the time was to come . when to know an affair in his charge was to abandon anxiety concerning it . the question of the wardrobe was embarrassing only from its overwhelming answer . never even in the other days had allard , naturally simple in tastes . provided himself with the lavish and sybaritic completeness he found awaiting him now .
her heart being intent on him . she was aware of much that escaped the ordinary eye , and she was the first to notice when the drawing room bell rang . and mr. [male] rose , that [male] would say . `` my legs are the youngest , do not you stir , '' next day esther waited for the bell that was to call her lover from her . the afternoon wore slowly away , and she had begun to hope she was mistaken when the metal tongue commenced calling .
valentine was alone ; two other clocks , slower than that of saint philippe [female] roule . struck the hour of midnight from different directions . and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent , then [female] 's attention was engrossed by the clock in her room . which marked the seconds , she began counting them . remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart .
now , although [female] ramee appreciated , as of a certain value . the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance . still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of [male] iv . hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family . he accepted , therefore , with delight , an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc [male] grammont .
she would have been very happy to have a handsome and tyrannical son . and would have taken an extreme interest in his love affairs . this was the light in which she had come to regard [female] . who had conciliated her at first , and made his impression by his delicate and calculated deference . a sort of exhibition to which mrs. [male] was particularly sensitive .
but how is a newspaper writer to restrain himself when his opponent is incurring everlasting punishment . or , worse still , carrying away others to a similar doom , in that they read . and perhaps even purchase , that which the lost one has written ? in this way the contents of religious newspapers are apt to be personal . and heavy , biting , scorching attacks , become the natural vehicle of [male] examiners .
before mrs. [female] , however , had put away her knitting . voices were heard at a good distance down the lane . but coming nearer every moment , and once more [female] climbed the little brow to look and to listen . [organization] did not answer , as she might have done , that this probability of [female] 's bringing sylvia home had been her own suggestion . set aside by her husband as utterly unlikely , another minute and the countenances of both parents imperceptibly and unconsciously relaxed into pleasure as sylvia came in .
uncertainty was at an end for [male] . fortunately it still lasted for the men , he took advantage of their hesitation . it was time lost for them . but gained for him , he slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself . and went down the rue des postes , towards the region of the jardin des plantes .
he took no notice whatever of me . although i , on my way to the lee of the chart house . stood at his shoulder a full minute , offering him a chance to speak . he knew i was there , for his big shoulder brushed my arm as he swayed and turned to warn the helmsmen in the one breath to hold her up to it but to keep her full . he had neither time nor courtesy for a passenger in such a moment .
it was a half buried crucifix , a little [female] under a little sloping hood . at the top of a pole , he sheered away . somebody was going to murder him , he had a great dread of being murdered . but it was a dread which stood outside him . like his own ghost , yet why be afraid ? it was bound to happen .
like a crime which no statute had ever contemplated , it stood out self accused and self condemned . a few might , perhaps , have been merciful , but they were overborne by numbers . lady glencore 's beauty and her vast fortune were now counts in the indictment against her . and many a jealous rival was not sorry at this hour of humiliation . the despotism of beauty is not a very mild sway , after all .
she studied the house a while . then opened the gate , and went in , two or three steps led to a little piazza . she seated herself on the top step . and tried to peep in at the closed blinds of the nearest window , while she was doing so . a woman with a shawl over her head came hastily down a narrow side street or alley .
the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing room when mr. [male] made his appearance among them . he had returned to a late dinner , and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over . he had been too much expected by the best judges , for surprize . but there was great joy , mr. [male] was almost as glad to see him now . as he would have been sorry to see him before , [male] only was in mute astonishment. .
athos , as the name of [female] was pronounced , looked inquisitively at [male] . in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face . but [male] was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age . dressed simply , but in perfect taste , entered the room , raising , as he came . his hat , adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers .
had he resolved to do his best to prevent this visit to yorkshire , or had he resolved to further it . i think he would have gone to [male] without much fear of the rain . on the second day after the funeral he did go , and he had then made up his mind . [female] , if she would listen to him . should show her independence of lady [female] by staying a few days with the askertons before she went to yorkshire .
the visitors glanced at the long boy , who seemed to indicate by a broader stare of his mouth and eyes that in him [male] stood confessed . the visitors again considered it a point of politeness to look at [male] . who , looking at them , suddenly threw back his head , extended his mouth to its utmost width . and laughed loud and long , at this the two innocents , with their brains in that apparent danger . laughed , and mrs [female] laughed , and the orphan laughed .
they stood by the gate awhile . [male] listlessly staring at the ground , his mind sped into the future . and saw there enacted in years of leisure the scenes of repentance that would ensue from this work of haste . that they were married he had instantly decided , why had it been so mysteriously managed ? it had become known that she had had a fearful journey to bath .
`` glad i do not have to do that every day , '' he commented . wiping his brow with the back of his wrist . as the skin dried he worked and kneaded it to softness . the result was a fair quality of white buckskin . the first thorpe had ever made , if wetted , it would harden dry and stiff .
but all dissatisfactions and worries and misgivings took wings and flew away when . just ten days before the travellers were to start , a new and delightful change was made in the programme . [male] telegraphed that the ship , instead of coming to [location] . was ordered to [location] to refit , and he wanted [male] to join him there early in june . prepared to spend the summer ; while almost simultaneously came a letter from mrs. [female] .
so lady [female] and [female] payland travelled up to town again . and took up their old quarters , and mr. [male] returned , and resumed his room and his accustomed habits . but before he had been many hours in [location] . he had ascertained , by the evidence of his own eyes . that [male] was , as he had predicted , in town .
my sister , mrs. [female] . was more than twenty years older than i , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors because she had brought me up `` by hand . '' having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant . and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me . i supposed that [female] and i were both brought up by hand .
she had often heard of [male] 's old castle up in the north . an inheritance from his mother 's family . but was hardly prepared for so much picturesque beauty or such stateliness of archway and entrance . as they wound up the hillside and the grey turrets came into view . with pine woods behind and above , she seemed to hear [male] 's boyish voice under the cedar at overdene .
with a curt nod the indian seated himself by the fire . and , producing a square plug of tobacco and a knife . began leisurely to fill his pipe , [male] watched him in silence . finally injin [male] spoke in the red man 's clear cut . imitative english , a pause between each sentence .
when she had backed through the doorway , the girl still faced toward the inner vestibule . and it was well she did so , for scarcely was she out of his sight before the [male] giant was after her . taking the chance that she would have turned to run , but there was the resolute young face . with eyes defying his ; and there was the weapon ready to blow out such brains as he had . if the hand on the knife moved , again he fell back .
but [female] trembled as the cab drew up at no , 3 , paramount crescent . she met her aunt . as was usual , just inside the drawing room door , and she saw at once that if any bitterness had passed away from that face . the original bitterness must indeed have been bitter , she had so timed her letter that lady macleod should have no opportunity of answering it . the answer was written there in the mingled anger and sorrow of those austere features , [female] !
the exact words that passed between mr. bundercombe and his wife we , alas , never knew . she turned her left shoulder pointedly toward the young woman . whom she had designated as a hussy , and talked steadily for about a minute and a half at mr. bundercombe . the history of what followed was reflected in that gentleman 's expressive face . he appeared to listen , at first in amazement , afterward in annoyance .
what had occurred between them and her wearing the diamonds was typical . one evening , shortly before they came to the abbey . they were going to dine at [female] castle . [female] had said to herself that she would never wear those diamonds . they had horrible words clinging and crawling about them .
those who sit in the high places must be hard , yet have i discovered that it is hard to be hard . for instance , easy enough was it to drop [male] as he was in the act of shooting at me . yet it is most difficult to be hard with a chuckle headed retainer like [male] . especially when he continually fails by a shade to give sufficient provocation . for twenty-four hours after my talk with [male] i was on pins and needles to have it out with him .
that much the woman had confided in her , for she was only six when it happened . and she had not dared to look at jolly [female] when she told him of what had passed since then . so she saw little of the hardening in his face as he listened . but he had blown his nose -- hard , it was a way with jolly [female] . and she had not known him long enough to understand what it meant .
and so the court , growing momentarily wise again under the spur of fear . preferred to temporize , necker should be brought back yet once again , the three orders should sit united as [organization] demanded . it was the completest surrender of force to force . the only argument , the king went alone to inform [organization] of that eleventh hour resolve . to the great comfort of its members , who viewed with pain and alarm the dreadful state of things in [location] .
she came nearer , and he saw it was [female] . the moment she recognized [female] . she began to run to him ; but , when she came near enough to take notice of his mien . as he stood with his foot in the stirrup . with no word of greeting or look of reception .
imitating every caution , stepping in the boy 's tracks . and keeping a few rods behind , followed his father , he had rolled his sleeves to the elbow . left his shirt open at the throat , while for weeks the joy of wind and weather on his bared head had been his . so that as he silently followed his son he made an impressive figure . at a certain point [male] stopped , motioning his father to come to him .
the avonlea graveyard was as yet the grass grown solitude it had always been . to be sure , the improvers had an eye on it . and priscilla grant had read a paper on cemeteries before the last meeting of the society . at some future time the improvers meant to have the lichened , wayward old board fence replaced by a neat wire railing . the grass mown and the leaning monuments straightened up .
i turned to stand face to face with the girl in the red tam o ', shanter . `` i beg your pardon , '' i said , stepping away from the canoe . she did not wear the covert coat of the morning . but a red knit jacket , buttoned tight about her , she was young with every emphasis of youth . a pair of dark blue eyes examined me with good humored curiosity .
`` your book an instant , '' such was the mode in which i often began these brief dialogues . the time was always just at the conclusion of the lesson . and motioning to her to rise , i installed myself in her place , allowing her to stand deferentially at my side . for i esteemed it wise and right in her case to enforce strictly all forms ordinarily in use between master and pupil . the rather because i perceived that in proportion as my manner grew austere and magisterial .
when they rose from table , levin would have liked to follow [male] into the drawing room . but he was afraid she might dislike this , as too obviously paying her attention . he remained in the little ring of men . taking part in the general conversation , and without looking at [male] . he was aware of her movements , her looks .
i desired her to be so kind as to call me at seven . and , promising to do so , she withdrew , then , having broken my long fast on a cup of tea and a little thin bread and butter . i sat down beside the small , smouldering fire , and amused myself with a hearty fit of crying . after which , i said my prayers , and then , feeling considerably relieved , began to prepare for bed . finding that none of my luggage was brought up , i instituted a search for the bell .
there was indeed much to talk of at this closing of a reign which had been full of struggles with problems affecting not only england but all the european powers . what the [male] of ryswick had effected , what the death of [male] of [male] would bring . whether [male] would play fairly , how long king [male] 's broken frame would last . what the power of the marlboroughs would be when the princess [female] came to the throne . all these things they discussed together , and in their arguments my lord [female] was often roused to the wonder other ripe minds had felt in coming in contact with the activity and daring of this younger one .
on the sunday nothing was seen of mr. [male] . he did not come to church , nor would he dine at the vicarage . he remained the whole day in his own house . pretending to write , trying to read , with accounts before him , with a magazine in his hand . even with a volume of sermons open on the table before him .
symbols of reflectiveness passed into her face . and a note of tragedy at times into her voice . her eyes grew larger and more eloquent , she became what would have been called a fine creature . her aspect was fair and arresting ; her soul that of a woman whom the turbulent experiences of the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize . but for the world 's opinion those experiences would have been simply a liberal education .
mr. [male] was then asked to explain in what way he came possessed of the cheque . the question was first put by lord lufton . but it soon fell into mr. [male] 's hands . who certainly asked it with all the kindness with which such an inquiry could be made . could mr. [male] at all remember by what means that bit of paper had come into his possession .
there is little need to dwell upon the details of that most bitter time . people get over these sort of things somehow . and grief and shame are very rarely fatal , even to the most sensitive natures . `` alas , sweet friend , '' says [female] 's [female] . `` you must believe this heart is stone ; it did not break ! ''
a word or two further was at first said about that unfortunate wood for which [male] at the present felt himself responsible . finn said that he was sure the duke would look to it . if [male] would mention it , [male] simply groaned . [male] said nothing , remembering how many troubles he had on hand at this moment . then by degrees their solicitude worked itself round to the cares of a neighbouring hunt .
i slept in a dream of tossing seas and ships labouring among them . with the sense of a summons i waked . i can not tell when , unmistakable , as if i were called by name . i rose and dressed , and heard distinctly bare feet passing my door . i opened it noiselessly and looked out into the little passage way that made for the entry .
events still crowded so closely that i missed much , i saw the steward . belligerent and cautious , his long knife poised for a slash . emerge from the chart house , [male] followed him . and behind her came wada , who carried my .22 winchester automatic rifle . as he told me afterwards .
so surrounded , so caressed , she was even happy , in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued . and the pleasure of seeing her , leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity . they were all seated round the tea table , which mrs. [female] had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller . whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice . before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her .
when he received the news of the battle of borodino and the abandonment of [location] . rostov was not seized with despair , anger , the desire for vengeance . or any feeling of that kind , but everything in voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome . and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness . the conversations he heard seemed to him insincere .
when the carriage stopped , the party on horseback were coming at a walking pace . [female] was in front beside veslovsky . [female] , quietly walking her horse , a sturdy english cob with cropped mane and short tail . her beautiful head with her [female] hair straying loose under her high hat . her full shoulders , her slender waist in her [female] riding habit .
`` why doth not that woman leave us , my holly ? '' asked ayesha from the other end of the cave . where she was engaged in carelessly examining some of the sculptures on the wall . `` she is not willing to leave leo , '' i answered . not knowing what to say , ayesha wheeled round , and , pointing to the girl ustane . said one word , and one only , but it was quite enough , for the tone in which it was said meant volumes .
[male] and i began to yell like madmen . fear spurred [male] on , we rushed up the treads of the staircase . stumbling as we went , anything to escape the dark . to return to the mortal light of the room of mirrors ! but perhaps it was not the eleven o'clock of which we stood in dread .
`` what are you driving at there ? '' said mr. [male] . holding his stick between his knees and settling his wig . while he gave her a momentary sharp glance . which seemed to react on him like a draught of cold air and set him coughing . mrs. [female] had to defer her answer till he was quiet again .
closing his eyes , he bowed a [male] francaise . without taking leave , and trying to attract as little attention as possible , he left the room . he sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same remark on the same day in different circles . but he was so busy for whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing . as he had done on their first meeting at kochubey 's .
if she did not keep it all , might she still keep something . enough for decent life -- and yet comfort herself with the feeling that she had expiated her sin ? and what would be said of her when she had made this great surrender ? would not the world laugh at her instead of praising her . that world as to which she had assured mr. [male] that she did not care what its verdict about her might be ? she had many doubts , ah ! why had not [female] clavering remained true to her ?
here was something really to vex her about [male] : it was all very well not to accept sir [male] . but the idea of marrying mr. [male] , [male] felt a sort of shame mingled with a sense of the ludicrous . but perhaps [female] , if she were really bordering on such an extravagance . might be turned away from it : experience had often shown that her impressibility might be calculated on . the day was damp , and they were not going to walk out , so they both went up to their sitting room .
miss bennet , do you know who i am ? i have not been accustomed to such language as this . i am mr. [male] 's own aunt , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . let me be rightly understood , this match can never take place . no , never , mr. [female] is engaged to my daughter . now what have you got to say ? only this -- that if it is so .
the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature . but the four succeeding years -- years , which if rationally spent . give such improvement to the understanding , must have opened his eyes to her defects of education . while the same period of time , spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits . had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty .
it was a gentleman 's voice . it was a voice that [male] was just turning pale about . when mr. [male] walked into the room . while trying to keep herself alive , their visitor , who had at first approached her with as animated a countenance as ever . was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away , and giving her time to recover .
when the sacristan whispered to father [male] that an indian couple had just come in . wishing to be married , the father frowned , his supper was waiting ; he had been out all day . over at the old mission olive orchard , where he had not found things to his mind . the indian man and wife whom he hired to take care of the few acres the church yet owned there had been neglecting the church lands and trees . to look after their own , the father was vexed , tired , and hungry .
but he was a dogged and persevering man ; he knew the power of money and the shifts to which people can be driven who are made desperate by the want of it . he knew , too , that it is no rare thing for women who are attached to one man to sell themselves to another of their own free will . realising that love may pass , but wealth does not , therefore he still hoped that with so many circumstances bringing an ever increasing pressure upon her . [female] 's spirit would in time be broken . her resistance would collapse , and he would have his will , nor , as the sequel will show .
his reason for leaving his breakfast unfinished to run after miss [female] barral 's governess . was to speak to her in reference to that very errand possessing the utmost possible importance in his eyes . he shrugged his shoulders at the nervousness of her eyes and hands . at the half strangled whisper `` i had to go out , i could hardly contain myself . '' that was her affair , he was , with a young man 's squeamishness .
what was she to do ? she must tell him . otherwise it might quite easily happen that they might meet in [location] when she returned there . she pictured the scene , she saw herself walking with dudley pickering . along came bill , `` claire , [female] ! '' ... heavens , what would dudley think ? it would be too awful , she could not explain .
and yet it was of a woman that he was thinking as he leant over the gate . and looked at the field of yellowing corn , undulating like a golden sea beneath the pressure of the wind . and then it was , as he leant over the gate . that the image of a woman 's face rose before his mind as it had continually risen during the last five years . five years had gone since he saw it .
but he went down to [male] , and told her to go in from time to time . and see how her [male] was , he found [female] rose and the old servant together . both had been crying , both were evidently in great trouble about the death and the mystery of the day . [female] asked if she might go up and see sylvia . and the doctor gave his leave , talking meanwhile with [male] over the kitchen fire .
lucilla received the account of what passed at the visit of the doctors with a stubborn resignation which it distressed me to see . remember what i told you when the first attack seized him , ', she said . `` our summer time is ended ; our winter is come , '' her manner . while she spoke , was the manner of a person who is waiting without hope . who feels deliberately that calamity is near , she only roused herself when oscar came in .
`` yes , '' agreed junko helplessly , in the momentary slack tide of work . the giant had conceived the idea of searching out the driver crew for purposes of pugilistic vengeance . [male] 's suspicions stung him . but his simple mind could see no direct way to explanation . all night long in the chill of a spring rain and windstorm the fighting forty and certain of the mill crew gave themselves to the labor of connecting the slanting stone cribs so strongly .
but as the reader is doubtless anxious to hear of [female] 's introduction to mrs. [female] and [female] . we will give a description of it in the next chapter . contrary to his first intention , [male] concluded to come north in july . he had of course learned from [female] that her mysterious guardian had proved to be judge [male] . his sister 's husband , and more recently she had written to him of judge [male] 's removal to [location] .
this resulted in [female] appearing at the church in a long blue cloth coat and skirt . handsomely embroidered with gold , and suiting her large figure to perfection . a deep yellow vest of brocaded silk ; and old lace ruffles at neck and wrists . [male] was as anxious about his wedding garments . as [male] had been indifferent over hers ; but he had so often been in requisition as best man at town weddings .
as [male] had no time to lose , on account of the audience of the king . which was fixed for midday , he cast his eyes around . and seeing that the street was empty , said to his adversary , my faith ! it is fortunate for you , although your name is [male] . to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer , never mind .
mrs. [female] had nothing more to tell . and [male] had no further questions to ask , he requested permission to retain the two letters written by the lieutenant and his daughter . and left the house with them in his pocket book . he walked straight back to the hotel , where he called for a time table . an express for [location] left wildernsea at a quarter past one .
[female] was greatly delighted with the child left in mrs. [female] 's care . the little girl interested her deeply , and every day she passed many hours with her . either at mrs. [female] 's house or her own . the [female] and beauty of the child were remarkable . and as , with the happy facility of childhood , she began to recover from the first feeling of strangeness and fear .
and , seeing all this , anthea felt herself very lonely all at once , and , turning aside . saw all things through a blur of sudden tears . she was possessed , also , of a sudden , fierce loathing of the future . a horror because of the promise her letter contained . nevertheless she was firm , and resolute on her course because of the pride that burned within her .
the footfalls of madame omber were sounding dangerously near , and without giving the girl more opportunity to protest . lanyard closed the windows , shot the latch and stole like a cat round the farther side of the desk . pausing within a few feet of the screen and safe , the desk lamp was still burning . where the girl had left it behind the cinnabar screen . and lanyard knew that the diffusion of its rays was enough to render his figure distinctly and immediately visible to one entering the doorway .
there was a second performance in the evening , and the tent was lighted up . troy had taken his part very quietly this time . venturing to introduce a few speeches on occasion ; and was just concluding it when . whilst standing at the edge of the circle contiguous to the first row of spectators . he observed within a yard of him the eye of a man darted keenly into his side features .
i can assure your lordship , in the first place . that no clergyman of the established church in the kingdom can be less unwilling than i am that they who dissent from my teaching in the parish should have a commodious place of worship . if land belonged to me in the place i would give it myself for such a purpose . and were there no other available site than that chosen , i would not for a moment remonstrate against it . i had heard , with satisfaction , from mr. puddleham himself that another spot was chosen near the cross roads in the village .
every word that she spoke to him was an encouragement to this . and yet he knew that it could not be so , to say a word of his love . or even to look it , would now be an unmanly insult , and yet . how was he not to look it , -- not to speak of it ? it is such a comfort that you should be here with me , ', she said .
`` no , no , i will go out to them , '' said princess [female] . and in spite of the nurse 's and dunyasha 's protests she went out into the porch . [location] , dunyasha , the nurse . and [female] ivanovich following her . the men crowded closer together , stirred , and rapidly took off their hats , princess [female] lowered her eyes and .
he wished to die ; the opportunity presented itself . he knocked at the door of the tomb . a hand in the darkness offered him the key . these melancholy openings which take place in the gloom before despair , are tempting . marius thrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him to pass .
why he had been told to guide the two younger ladies to the house of the crocodile . [male] pretended not to know , perhaps -- only perhaps -- [male] and his companion . [male] , wished to kidnap the one we called miss [female] . and they called [female] . but good , kind [female] had never dreamed that they meant any real harm .
facing this , and hanging over the side of the bed , was a portrait of his father . the eyes were full of light , the lines of the cheek were round . the mouth seemed to quiver with a tender smile . but [male] could not see it as it was . he saw it with straggling hair .
here a remark becomes necessary , fauchelevent , whatever his anguish . offered a drink , but he did not explain himself on one point . who was to pay ? generally , fauchelevent offered and father mestienne paid , an offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the new grave digger . and it was necessary to make this offer , but the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after rabelais in the dark . and that not unintentionally , as for himself , fauchelevent did not wish to pay .
he walked forth upon his domain , glad of its beauty and the heavenly brightness of the day which showed it fair . he had spent an hour out of doors . and returning to the terrace fronting the house , where already the peacocks had begun to walk daintily . spreading or trailing their gorgeous iridescent plumes , he looked up at his [location] 's casement and gave a start . my lord duke sate there still in his gala apparel of white and gold brocade .
what would be the good of [organization] 's going , -- or the good of his putting himself out of the way . by a visit which would of itself be so tiresome to him . if the one object of the visit could not be carried out ? the earl and his sister had planned the invitation with the express intention of bringing [female] and eames together . it seemed that [female] was firm in her determination to resist this intention . and , if so , it would be better that the whole thing should fall to the ground .
[location] , flying hither and thither . watched him at his work , the other recess which he had chosen had within it a species of passage like a gallery in a mine of pretty good depth . he had had at first an idea of making this his lodging . but the draught was so continuous and so persevering in this passage that he had been compelled to give it up . this current of air , incessantly renewed , first gave him the notion of the forge .
it was lover like , and even boyish , of him to think it necessary to explain his absence . but why had he not simply come in and told her , she instinctively connected the little fact with the shade of preoccupation she had noticed on his face the night before . when she had gone to his room and found him absorbed in letter . and while she dressed she had continued to wonder what was in the letter . and whether the telegram he had hurried out to send was an answer to it .
[female] sat there in a panic , trying to make her mouth form words . she saw her sister 's sardonic expression and mrs. [female] 's face turning a vivid red . [male] was looking down at his watch chain , fingering it . [male] rose suddenly and awkwardly to his feet , in a second every one was standing tensely and [female] was saying something very hurriedly about having to go early . and the ahearns were listening with eager intentness , then mrs. [male] swallowed and turned with a forced smile toward [male] .
she turned as she spoke and preceded him up the little path . bordered by clumps of hydrangea , veronica and fuchsia . to the house , the garden on either side of the shingle path . a curious mixture of vegetables and flowers . glowed with all the tints of autumn , at the door of the house a lady was awaiting them .
for the laurences knew how to make summer idleness both charming and wholesome , [female] was very fond of her little [female] . mrs [female] felt that whether her niece was an actress or not she must be a gentlewoman . and gave her the social training which marks the well bred woman everywhere ; while uncle laurie was never happier than when rowing . riding , playing , or lounging with two gay girls beside him . [male] bloomed like a wild flower in this free life .
i do not know if they were good , but they were big . and with their elaborate , tarnished gilt frames had a melancholy dignity . the man himself sat at a shining . inlaid writing table which looked like a rare piece from a museum of art . his chair had a high , oval , carved back , upholstered in faded tapestry .
as i was ignorant of the month in which sir [male] was born . i began my backward search with the early part of the year . the register book was of the old-fashioned kind , the entries being all made on blank pages in manuscript . and the divisions which separated them being indicated by ink lines drawn across the page at the close of each entry , no ! not through september also , under the heading of that month in the year i found the marriage .
`` god bless you , [female] ! '' mrs [female] said to him . as she parted with him at her own door . it was the first time that she had called him by his [male] name . `` i hope you understand how much we are trusting to you . ''
of course it was out of the question for me to miss such fun . so not waiting for an invitation i lost no time in getting my own forty fives in active operation . and in less time than it takes to tell it what was left of those greasers were making tracks for the nearest state line . while a red headed youngster with a smoking 45 in his fist was shaking hands with me and trying to say something about my saving his life . i took a shine to him at once on account of his pluck and our friendship thus begun has lasted through the years until now time and fate have thrown [male] both together on the same line of railroad .
bah , all a cloak to hide his real motive . and he knows it , i may as well confess . [ looks around to see if overheard , whispers. ] for over twenty years i . i have broken my marriage vow ! [ [female] drops her eyes , [female] aghast .
mrs marsham made still a little effort . a little effort that was probably involuntary , she put out her hand . and laid it on lady [female] 's left shoulder . looking into her face as she did so with all the severity of caution of which she was [female] . lady [female] shook her duenna off angrily .
she hesitated ; she looked at the nearest picture . then followed him to another , he now did what he had refused to do for the old lady who tempted him to it . he made fun of the pictures a little . but so amiably and with so much justice to their good points that the painter himself would not have minded his jesting . from time to time he made imogene smile .
almost without seeming to touch him this latent coalition had reduced him to rags . had left him bleeding , distressed , and , as it were , hors [male] combat . even before the battle , he laboured , indeed , not the less -- without pause or rest . but as the work advanced , the workman himself lost ground . it might have been fancied that nature , dreading his bold spirit .
the gallery was such as those which marjorie had noted on the way to the tower . a high hung , airy place , running the length of the house . contrived on the level of the second floor , with the first floor roof beneath and overhanging attics above . it was supported on massive oak beams . and protected from the street by a low balustrade of a height to lean the elbows upon it .
mr. [male] was stunned by the shock . and only recovered when the time came for being angry at every suggestion of his man 's . the bag was packed , the cab ordered , the railway reached . in twenty minutes from the moment of this decision . the [location] train whizzed by , drew back some yards .
mrs. [female] snapped the catch of the leash . and gammire departed in the likeness of a ragged [male] streak . with his large and eccentric ears flapping back in the wind and his afterpart hunched in . he ran round and round the little orchard like a dog gone wild . altogether a comedian , when he heard children shrieking with laughter .
faith in a star mingled with strategic science , elevating but perturbing it . [location] was the bareme of war . [male] was its [male] ; and on this occasion . genius was vanquished by calculation , on both sides some one was awaited . it was the exact calculator who succeeded , [male] was waiting for grouchy .
jolly [female] , to an extent , forgot [male] . he tried to deaden within him the impulses which yellow bird 's conjuring had roused . he tried to see in them a menace and a danger . and he repeated to himself the folly of placing credence in yellow bird 's `` medicine . '' but his efforts were futile , and he was honest enough to admit it .
suddenly he went to the door , determined that if bateese was outside he would get some satisfaction out of him or challenge him to a fight right there . he beat against it , first with one fist and then with both , he shouted . there was no response , then he exerted his strength and his weight against the door . it was solid , he was half turned when his eyes discovered . in a corner where the lamplight struck dimly .
`` it 's a pretty lonely job -- and a pretty hard one . '' i turned from the window , [female] 's automobile had stopped in front of the house . i was to go in it to call on mrs. and miss swink . [female] had insisted that i use it . i dressed quickly , putting on my best garments , but as i got into the car something of the old protest at having to do what i did not want to do .
but it must materially lessen their chances of marrying men of any consideration in the world . good morning , gentlemen , i am so sorry that mr. [male] has gone for his walk . it is very [male] to have netherfield open once more , although you must both miss [location] . there is so much gaiety in [location] , yes , in a country neighbourhood you move in a confined and unvarying society . but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them forever .
`` the plot thickens , '' she said to herself . stealing to the window , which looked out upon the garden , there , to her amazement . she saw mademoiselle loire emerging laboriously from the dining room window . she saw her in the moonlight creep down the garden towards the wall at the end . but what happened after that she could only guess at , as the trees cast a shadow which hid the lady from view .
at other times , while they followed the sheep . leisurely , from one feeding ground to another , he provoked her to talk of the things they were reading . and , while he thus led her to think , he as carefully guarded her speech and language . at first they took the old familiar path of early intellectual training . but , little by little , he taught her to find the way for herself .
what a cold , loose touch , he impressed on my fingers ! he was deeply displeased by what had occurred that day ; cordiality would not warm . nor tears move him , no happy reconciliation was to be had with him . no cheering smile or generous word : but still the [male] was patient and placid . and when i asked him if he forgave me .
mr [male] wished him good night in the tone of a man who had heard a mournful . not to say despairing , exclamation , and who sought to infuse some encouragement and hope into the mind of the person by whom it had been uttered . such tone was probably a part of his oddity . as one of a crotchety band ; for how could he have heard anything of that kind . without [male] 's hearing it too ?
every one who hears of the loss of [male] is grief stricken and distracted , the king would have rejoiced at the coming of my lord gawain and would have been delighted with his acquaintance . but he is so sorrowful and distressed over the betrayal of [male] that he is prostrated and full of grief . and the queen beseeches him insistently to have him searched for . up and down throughout the land , without postponement or delay . my lord gawain and [male] and all the others join in this prayer and request .
another day he spoke to the porter . the porter , on his side , spoke , and said to [male] . [male] , who is that curious young man who is asking for you ? on the morrow [male] bestowed on marius that glance which marius at last perceived . a week later , [male] had taken his departure .
mary was taking off her outdoor things in the bedroom . she heard katharine call her . `` yes , '' she said , `` i sha not be a moment . '' but the moment prolonged itself , as if for some reason [female] found satisfaction in making herself not only tidy . but seemly and ornamented , a stage in her life had been accomplished in the last months which left its traces for ever upon her bearing .
rasselas was desirous to go with them ; but neither his sister nor [organization] would consent . the arab , according to the custom of his nation . observed the laws of hospitality with great exactness to those who put themselves into his power . and in a few days brought pekuah , with her maids . by easy journeys , to the place appointed , where , receiving the stipulated price .
the goal is reached , after the final war of 1815 [male] possesses all possible power . how does he use it ? as the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself . and yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to comprehend . so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man . a bee settling on a flower has stung a child .
the attorney said , looking over the banisters ; `` i want you to witness your son in law 's will . '' mr. [male] 's spirits rose a little at this , he was not much versed in the ways of lawyers . and had a notion that mr. [male] would read the will to him . perhaps , before he signed it , it flashed upon him presently that a legatee could not benefit by a will which he had witnessed . it was obvious , therefore , that [male] did not mean him to have anything .
the [male] went away , wondering , `` mr. [male] 's '' likes and dislikes had been the law of the house in general until now . if he had liked any particular food or drink . any seat or place , any special degree of warmth or coolness . his wishes were to be attended to ; for he was the heir . and he was delicate , and he was the clever one of the family .
through the stillness of the house the hammering of the brass knocker sounded loudly . [male] in his room and conscience in hers . both heard it , with a sense of astonishment . the man opened his door and hurried to the stairhead . where he found conscience , arrived in advance of him .
`` ay , '' said macdonald , growing white and rigid , `` i struck you twice , lenoir , here ! '' he offered the other side of his face . lenoir danced up carefully , made a slight pass , and struck the offered cheek . `` now , that is done , will it please you to do it again ? '' said macdonald , with earnest entreaty in his voice .
she had always spoken , with a grave face , of [male] and his love as of a great misfortune . even to [female] herself ; and her pity for [female] had been founded on the conviction of her innocence . now all those ideas had to be altered , [female] owned her fault . confessed herself to be guilty of all that lady [female] so frequently laid to her charge . and confessed herself anxious to commit every crime as to which [female] had been ever so ready to defend her .
finally there were but three of [female] left , a great green warrior of some far northern horde . [female] , and myself , the other two were to battle and then i to fight the conqueror for the liberty which was accorded the final winner . [male] had fought several times during the day and like myself had always proven victorious . but occasionally by the smallest of margins , especially when pitted against the green warriors . i had little hope that he could best his giant adversary who had mowed down all before him during the day .
she did at first somewhat imprudently endeavour to spread a rumour abroad that the doctor had become enslaved by the lady 's beauty . but even those hostile to bowick could not accept this , the doctor certainly was not the man to put in jeopardy the respect of the world and his own standing for the beauty of any woman . and , moreover , the doctor , as we have said before , was over fifty years of age . but there soon came up another ground on which calumny could found a story . it was certainly the case that mrs. [female] had never accepted any hospitality from mrs. [female] or other ladies in the neighbourhood .
god forgive him , where he was gone ! presumptuous man , stand back , in that stripped and naked house there was one room still untouched . it was the room that had been kept for the deemster . [male] lay on the bed . motionless and apparently lifeless , [male] stood beating his hands at the foot .
the son of [male] was so cruel , and treated his slaves so badly . that , when those who were at the oars saw that the she wolf galley was bearing down upon them and gaining upon them . they all at once dropped their oars and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end of the gangway shouting to them to row lustily . and passing him on from bench to bench , from the poop to the prow . they so bit him that before he had got much past the mast his soul had already got to hell .
and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers . some historians -- those biographical and specialist historians already referred to -- in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power . seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons . and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power . and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power , mere violence .
also i have been chosen for the spring dramatics . as you like it out of doors . i am going to be [male] , own [male] to [male] . and lastly : [male] and [male] and i are going to [location] next friday to do some spring shopping and stay all night and go to the theatre the next day with `` master [male] . '' he invited us , [male] is going to stay at home with her family .
all was ready now ; and christmas day was much enlivened by last rehearsals , the panics of timid actors . the scramble for forgotten properties , and the decoration of the theatre . evergreen and holly from the woods , blooming plants from the hothouse on parnassus . and flags of all nations made it very gay that night in honour of the guests who were coming . chief among them , miss cameron .
`` how kind of you to say so , '' responded [female] . with dancing eyes , her sense of humor was developing . and the speeches that would have hurt her at fourteen were becoming merely food for amusement now . [female] suspected that [female] was laughing at her behind those wicked eyes . but she contented herself with whispering to gertie , as they went downstairs .
he could not do that , unfortunately , but he could talk while he worked . and talk he did ; voluminously ; pouring out every kind of information . illustrating what he said with gestures so lively that he had to put down the watering pot . and thus delay the end of the watering , lady caroline bore it for a time but presently was unable to bear it . and as he would not go , and she could not tell him to .
there was no solution , but that universal solution which life gives to all questions . even the most complex and insoluble , that answer is : one must live in the needs of the day . that is , forget oneself , to forget himself in sleep was impossible now . at least till nighttime ; he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter women . so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life .
i have been engaged in the opium trade with the largest houses in [location] . all ten times richer than ever i was , you have no idea . in [location] , what these rich east [location] merchants are . i went to [location] minor and purchased opium at low prices . and from thence to [location] where i delivered my cargoes to the companies who control the trade .
thereafter followed a spell of racing , the spaniard ever lessening the distance between them . and the land dropping astern until it was no more than a hazy line above the shimmering sea . suddenly from the spaniard appeared a little cloud of white smoke . and the boom of a gun followed , and after it came a splash a cable 's length ahead of the swallow 's bows . linstock in hand the brawny gunner on the poop stood ready to answer them when the word should be given .
lady monk perceived that mr [male] had in truth left his wife behind because he believed her to be ill . and not because he was afraid of [female] fitzgerald . so accomplished a woman as lady monk felt no doubt that the wife 's absence was caused by fear of the lover . and not by any cold caught in viewing ruins by moonlight . she was not to be deceived in such a matter , but she became aware that mr [female] had been deceived .
addressed thus nearly upon equal terms , the stranger gracefully accepted the donation . and , from the relief produced by this unexpected good treatment , her own manners acquired an ease . and her language a flow , that made her strikingly appear to be what harleigh had called her . a well bred and elegant young woman ; and the desire of [female] to converse with her no longer hung . now , upon the mere stimulus of curiosity ; it became flattering .
he must have known , somehow , that we were on board . for he said `` good morning '' very confidently , and waited , for the greeting to be returned . then he strolled aft , and we slipped forward . oh , i know you re aboard , he called out . and i could see him listen intently after he had spoken .
here , therefore , the princes of the crusade were assembled awaiting [female] 's arrival . and even the brief delay which was thus interposed was turned to his disadvantage by his enemies . various instances being circulated of his pride and undue assumption of superiority . of which even the necessity of the present short pause was quoted as an instance . men strove to fortify each other in their evil opinion of the king of england .
at these words she opened the door of the corridor . and pushed [female] out of the room , [male] obeyed like a child . without the least resistance or objection , which proved that he was really in love . [male] ran home immediately , and although it was three o'clock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of [location] to traverse . he met with no misadventure , everyone knows that drunkards and lovers have a protecting deity .
the street was quiet , deserted , and hung with a thin bluish haze . he had already fixed his sharp eye upon the house which he reasoned should be his objective point . when he noticed a woman approaching rapidly from the opposite direction . always an interested observer of women , [male] would have slackened his pace anywhere to follow this one with his impersonal , appreciative glance . she was a person of distinction he saw at once .
balashev recovered himself and began to speak , he said that the emperor [male] did not consider [male] 's demand for his passports a sufficient cause for war . that [male] had acted on his own initiative and without his sovereign 's assent . that the emperor [male] did not desire war . and had no relations with england , `` not yet , '' interposed [male] . and , as if fearing to give vent to his feelings , he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashev might proceed .
by such little things do great things seem to come about : not really , i know it was not because i said just what i did say . and did what i did yesterday , that your heart was bound to come for mine . but it was those small things that brought you consciousness . and when we parted i knew that i had all the world at my feet . or all heaven over my head , ah , at last i may let the spirit of a kiss go to you from me .
[female] , with her head in her hands . sat making a low moaning , and swaying herself on her chair . but gave no answer , or , said estella , -- which is a nearer case . if you had taught her , from the dawn of her intelligence . with your utmost energy and might , that there was such a thing as daylight .
all the tapers for which places could be found had been gathered together , and the room was a blaze of light . in the midst of it , before her mirror . [female] stood attired in her bridal splendour of white satin and flowing rich lace . a diamond crescent on her head . sparks of light flaming from every point of her raiment .
captain , upon my soul i should like to be in the magistrate 's shoes and judge this case . the lad is probably not innocent , one can not be sure , but we do know that the girl is guilty . if there is any guilt in the matter , pastor . well . well , i judge no one , but what were we talking about when this stupid business interrupted us ? it was about [female] and her confirmation .
welcome , sir , by your dress you are of the church . and consequently a messenger of comfort , you are most welcome , sir , [male] . i wish to bring comfort and avoid upbraidings : for your own conscience will reproach you more than the voice of a preacher . from the sensibility of your countenance , together with a language . and address superior to the vulgar , it appears , young man .
king melodias sought out a gentleman that was well learned . and taught , and with him , named gouvernail . he sent young [male] away from lyonesse court into [location] . to learn the language and customs and deeds of arms . there he learned to be a harper passing all others of his time .
the first that he took up was a very impressive sketch , in which the artist had jotted down her rough ideas for a picture of [female] driving the nail through the temples of [female] . it was dashed off with remarkable power , and showed a touch or two that were actually lifelike and deathlike . as if [female] had been standing by when [female] gave the first stroke of her murderous hammer . or as if she herself were [female] . and felt irresistibly impelled to make her bloody confession in this guise .
the head carpenter abandoned the silent policy of a lifetime . he felt impelled to utter , he was a man who . when not at the theatre , spent most of his time in bed . reading all fiction magazines ; but it so happened that once , last summer . he had actually seen the sky ; and he considered that this entitled him to speak almost as a specialist on the subject .
he was to wait at turin till tidings should come from [male] . and after that he would go on to [male] ; but he would not move from turin till he should have received his first communication from england . when he had been three days at turin they came to him . and , among other letters in [male] 's packet . there was a letter addressed in his wife 's handwriting .
another man in evening clothes got on the car . and milt saw that he wore a silk hat . and a white knitted scarf ; that he took out and examined a pair of white kid gloves . he turned up the collar of his top coat to conceal his white tie . tried to hide each of his feet behind the other to cover up his pumps .
now this mouse is no allegory , and the paper bag is not a diamond necklace . in spite of the wedding cake sprinkled over it ! so do not say that this letter is too hard for your understanding , or you will frighten me from telling you anything foolish again . brains are like jewels in this , difference of surface has nothing to do with the size and value of them . yours is a beautiful smooth round .
`` good , sir , '' answered mr [male] . shrugging his shoulders , 'good , sir . since the business is to be done by some hands . let it be done by mine , such was my principle in the case of [male] and bawkins . such is my principle in most cases , [male] then proceeded to state to mr [male] his fixed resolution . he told mr [male] that his partner was a man of great simplicity and integrity .
the rapid expression of feeling corrected by the dictates of duty did not escape the moslem . who , if he did not entirely understand all which it conveyed , saw enough to convince him with the assurance that christians . as well as moslemah , had private feelings of personal pique . and national quarrels , which were not entirely reconcilable , but the saracens were a race . polished , perhaps , to the utmost extent which their religion permitted .
the words broke from her in a wail of passionate sorrow . and clasping her hands before her face , she wept for the first time that day . the violence of her sobs shook her slender frame . and she was obliged to lean against the trunk of a tree for support . [female] looked at her with a tender compassion in his face .
he was but like many others -- men , women . and children -- alive to distant , and dead to near things , he sought to possess the influence of a name in foreign countries and far-away seas . to become the head of a firm that should be known for generations . and it had taken him long silent years to come even to a glimmering of what he might be now . today , here in his own town , his own factory .
the only drawback of putting her under restraint was a very slight one , we merely turned her empty boast about knowing the secret into a fixed delusion . having first spoken in sheer crazy spitefulness against the man who had offended her . she was cunning enough to see that she had seriously frightened him . and sharp enough afterwards to discover that he was concerned in shutting her up . the consequence was she flamed out into a perfect frenzy of passion against him .
like the bend of a flower most rare the stalk of her graceful throat . like the poise of a flower most dainty the attitude of her beautiful . perfect body sheathed in a garment that outlined each movement . for the instant in suspense , like a mist the glimmering of her skin . the shining of her hair , the elusive moonlike quality of her whole personality as she stood there in the ghost like clearing listening .
mrs [female] had read the letter . with quick , glancing eyes , she had made herself [female] of its whole contents . and was already aware of the nature and extent of the sorrow which had come upon them . it was a sorrow that admitted of no hope . the man who had written that letter could never return again ; nor if he should return could he be welcomed back to them .
there was a big window overlooking the sea towards genoa . and a glass door through which she could proceed out on to the battlements and walk along past the quaint and attractive watch tower . in itself a room with chairs and a writing table . to where on the other side of the tower the battlements ended in a marble seat . and one could see [location] and the point round which began the gulf of spezia .
there is nothing that people wo not say ; -- nothing on earth , ', said [male] . then he got up and took his leave of her , he also wanted to part from her with some special expression of affection . but he did not know how to choose his words , he had wished that some allusion should be made . not to the braes of linter , but to the close confidence which had so long existed between them . but he found that the language to do this properly was wanting to him .
i did not answer , and , turning , he went down the steps and i into the house . for the past ten days i have been a very restless person . mrs. [female] looks at me out of the corners of her kind and keen and cheery little eyes when she does not think i am noticing . but she asks me nothing . mrs. [female] is the wisest woman i know .
no penitence and no confessional , no priest ordains it . yet they are forced to sit amid deep ashes of their vanished years . imagine a rambling , patchy house . the best part built of gray stone . and red tiled , a round tower jutting at one of the corners .
he responded by doing it so swiftly that she gasped with surprise . pausing momentarily within a yard of the wall . he gathered himself together , shot lithely into the air . caught the top curbing with both hands , and ... she heard the soft thud of his feet on the earth of the enclosure . the latch grated behind her ; the door opened .
the ride home through the sunset was a quiet one . to me it was one of the happiest hours of my life . dicky , fussing over me as if i were a fragile piece of [location] . sat in the most sheltered corner of the boat , and held me securely against him . protecting me with his arm from any sudden lurch or jolt the boat might give .
there were many domestic arrangements to be made in connection with the new commercial ones which affected hepburn and coulson . the fosters , with something of the busybodiness which is apt to mingle itself with kindly patronage . had planned in their own minds that the rose household should be removed altogether to the house belonging to the shop . and that [female] , with the assistance of the capable servant . who , at present , managed all [female] 's domestic affairs , should continue as [female] of the house .
as he walked on , thinking of his project , he strove hard to cheat himself into a belief that he would do a good thing in carrying lady [female] away from her husband . bad as had been his life he had never before done aught so bad as that . the more fixed his intention became , the more thoroughly he came to perceive how great and grievous was the crime which he contemplated . to elope with another man 's wife no longer appeared to him to be a joke at which such men as he might smile . but he tried to think that in this case there would be special circumstances which would almost justify him .
[female] 's book was the pride of her heart . and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise . it was only half a dozen little fairy tales . but [female] had worked over them patiently , putting her whole heart into her work . hoping to make something good enough to print , she had just copied them with great care .
the house in portman square had been practically given up by lord brentford to his son . but nevertheless the old earl and lady [male] had returned to it when they reached england from dresden . it was , however , large , and now the two families , -- if the earl and his daughter can be called a family . were lodging there together , the earl troubled them but little , living mostly in his own rooms . and lady [male] never went out with them , but there was something in the presence of the old man and the widow which prevented the house from being gay as it might have been .
she hesitated for a minute , but ultimately obeyed , going slowly down the garden to the house . where he heard the door latch click behind her . [female] was incensed beyond measure , his marriage had so far been a total failure . a source of bitter regret ; and the only course for improving his case . that of leaving the country , was a sorry , and possibly might not be a very effectual one .
[female] , on the contrary , found the house and grounds all that she could wish . the dark book shelves in the long library , the carpets and curtains with colors subdued by time . the curious old maps and bird's eye views on the walls of the corridor . with here and there an old vase below , had no oppression for her , and seemed more cheerful than the easts and pictures at the grange . which her uncle had long ago brought home from his travels .
cried many a shrill feminine voice , `` do not push , '' `` let me out ! '' `` you brute , '' `` save me , save me ! '' many ladies fainted , whilst their escorts , supporting them and protecting them as best they could . peered over the heads of their fellows for one glimpse of the divine miss [female] . yet for her and the duke , in the midst of the terrific compress .
for weeks , [male] had been thinking about these things . his bed stood in the sitting room , next to the kitchen . through the day , while the baking and washing and ironing were going on . the father lay and looked up at the roof beams that he himself had hewn . or out at the cattle in the corral , he counted the cattle over and over .
our eyes met , i shall never forget that glance , it had the concentrated patience . love , and pride , and loyalty . of all the years of suffering past and -- to come , at last we understood each other . at last our hands clasped and our lips met upon the perfect union of feeling and purpose for all our future lives . all was clear between us , bright , calm ; and i , at least .
listening to her i was no longer the enlightened , the creedless man . she herself was so near to the supernatural that it seemed brought near me . indefinable feelings , which had been latent in me , stirred into life . and following the direction of her divine , lustrous eyes . fixed on the blue sky above , i seemed to see there another being like herself .
i began to be a little surly with him , and told him i hoped he would not take it ill if i made myself amends upon him in a more legal way another time . and desired i might send for friends to see me have right done me . no , he said , he could give no such liberty . i might ask it when i came before the justice of [male] . and seeing i threatened him , he would take care of me in the meantime .
it was strange to robin to walk about the city , and to view all that he saw from his new interior position . the last time that he had been in his own country on that short visit with `` captain fortescue , '' he had been innocent in the eyes of the law . or , at least , no more guilty than any one of the hundreds of young men who . in spite of the regulations , were sent abroad to finish their education amid catholic surroundings .
carefully , on his knees , supporting himself by one hand . he crawled up the incline until the floor became level and then he stood upright . for a moment he halted there , trying to peer into the inky darkness . he seemed to be looking into a wide , open space ; a peculiar odor tainted the air . he took a few steps and paused again , then he turned one of his torches down inward to increase the flame .
all , oh , it 's simply uncanny , his power prophetic . it 's perfectly right -- we were going to say , by a pushing , etc . [male] . this very afternoon -- at two -- the court appointments will be given out . to each and all according to professional position , song -- [male] . ah . pity me , my comrades true .
the house was oddly different without her , [location] found the maids already in possession of her room . which they meant to clean thoroughly during her absence , to [location] it seemed as if they had brushed away sixty years or so with the first flick of their damp dusters . it seemed to her that the work she had tried to do in that room was being swept into a very insignificant heap of dust . the [location] shepherdesses were already shining from a bath of hot water . the writing table might have belonged to a professional man of methodical habits , gathering together a few papers upon which she was at work .
it was a flaw upon that project . she had to explain about and pay off that forty pounds ... then , quite insensibly , her queenliness had declined , she was never able to trace the changes her attitude had undergone . from the time when she believed herself to be the pampered queen of fortune . the crown of a good man 's love ( and secretly .
once so much to each other , now nothing , there had been a time . when of all the large party now filling the drawing room at uppercross . they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another , with the exception . perhaps , of admiral and mrs croft , who seemed particularly attached and happy , ( [female] could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples ) . there could have been no two hearts so open , no tastes so similar , no feelings so in unison .
armand certainly was still in danger , but [male] had pledged his word that armand would be safe . and somehow , as marguerite had seen him riding away , the possibility that he could fail in whatever he undertook never even remotely crossed her mind . when armand was safely over in england she would not allow him to go back to [location] . she felt almost happy now , and , drawing the curtains closely together again to shut out the piercing sun . she went to bed at last , laid her head upon the pillow .
even in bed he inquired daily about his money . and knew accurately the sum lying at his banker 's ; but he could be persuaded to disgorge nothing . he postponed from day to day the signing of certain cheques that were brought to him . and alleged very freely that an attempt was being made to rob him , during all his life he had been very generous in subscribing to public charities . but now he stopped all his subscriptions , the [male] had to provide even for the payment of wages .
to read between the lines was easier than to follow the text , and to suppose that miss stackpole wished the gentleman invited to gardencourt on her own account was the sign not so much of a vulgar as of an embarrassed mind . even from this venial act of vulgarity , however , [male] was saved . and saved by a force that i can only speak of as inspiration . with no more outward light on the subject than he already possessed he suddenly acquired the conviction that it would be a sovereign injustice to the correspondent of the interviewer to assign a dishonourable motive to any act of hers . this conviction passed into his mind with extreme rapidity .
all day long the turreted fargo mansion gleamed brightly in the glancing sunlight . giving no hint of the battle for a life going on within . mrs. [female] knew when her husband sent for the most celebrated doctor for throat diseases . knew when he came ; and knew also when each hour those who were fighting the foe . were driven back baffled , and several times she attempted to tell phronsie something of the shadow hanging over the little playmate 's home .
when to these recollections was added the development of wickham 's character . it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before . were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . when they parted , lady [female] , with great condescension . wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year .
`` oh , my bower new ... , '' chimed in twenty voices , and the castanet player . in spite of the burden of his equipment . rushed out to the front and , walking backwards before the company . jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone . the soldiers , swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously .
but atheism , although a very [male] theme for a critical and argumentative discussion after a lobster supper and unlimited champagne . is but a poor staff to lean upon when the worn-out traveller approaches the mysterious portals of the unknown land . the artist had boasted of his belief in annihilation . and had declared himself perfectly satisfied with a materialistic or pantheistic arrangement of the universe . and very indifferent as to whether he cropped up in future years as a summer cabbage .
he recovered , but lady elmwood fell sick and languished -- possessed of youth to struggle with her woes . she lingered on , till ten years decline brought her to that period . with which the reader is now going to be presented , in a lonely country on the borders of [location] . a single house by the side of a dreary heath . was the residence of the once gay , volatile miss milner .
whatever were her apprehensions , she would not turn back . it might be -- and the solace would be worth a world . that hilda , knowing nothing of the past night 's calamity . would greet her friend with a sunny smile , and so restore a portion of the vital warmth . for lack of which her soul was frozen , but could miriam , guilty as she was .
within , the church murmured with low talking , already two thirds of it was full . and all faces turned and re turned to the door at every footstep or sound . as the bells ceased a sigh went up , as if a giant drew breath . then , once again , the murmuring began , then , without sound or warning . except for the footsteps on the paving stones and the sudden darkening of the [male] on the floor .
seryozha , with radiant eyes and smiles . holding his mother by one hand and his nurse by the other . pattered on the rug with his fat little bare feet , the tenderness shown by his beloved nurse to his mother threw him into an ecstasy , mother ! she often comes to see me , and when she comes ... he was beginning , but he stopped , noticing that the nurse was saying something in a whisper to his mother .
as soon as i came into the room i saw that she had drawn this inference . but i also saw something which had not been in my forecast . poor miss tita 's sense of her failure had produced an extraordinary alteration in her . but i had been too full of my literary concupiscence to think of that , now i perceived it . i can scarcely tell how it startled me , she stood in the middle of the room with a face of mildness bent upon me .
fanny , rejoicing in her escape , and proud of the ready wit that had procured it . wrote the next morning to [female] , to request her company and her sister 's . for some days , in [female] street . as soon as lady [female] could spare them , this was enough to make [female] really and reasonably happy . mrs. [female] seemed actually working for her , herself .
when they first began to speak , the first name they learned to give each other were those of brother and sister . and childhood knows no softer appellation , their education . by directing them ever to consider each other 's wants , tended greatly to increase their affection . in a short time , all the household economy . the care of preparing their rural repasts , became the task of virginia .
for when all had been said on both sides , and much of it said over oftener than once . our senior , being well and ripely advised , pronounced the moderate and healing judgment . that the disputed cast was a drawn one , and should therefore count to neither party . this judicious decision restored concord to the field of players . they began anew to arrange their match and their bets .
when mrs. rivers left , esther consulted with mrs. [female] . the difficulty was now where she should put the child out at nurse . it was now just after two o'clock , the baby was fast asleep . and would want nothing for three or four hours , it would be well for esther to put on her hat and jacket and go off at once . mrs. [female] gave her the address of a respectable woman who used to take charge of children .
how beautiful had been those clouds , as soon as she was beyond the church wall . so that she could look again to the west , she gazed with all her eyes to see if there were still a remnant left of that arm , no . it had all melted into a monstrous shape , [organization] and gloomy . partaking of the darkness of night . the brightness of the vision was gone , but he bade her look into the clouds for new worlds .
throughout the autumn months he was busy helping his uncle with the plowing . the potatoes , and the fall work . soon the air began to nip , and the night 's frost to last throughout the shortening day . and then macdonald bhain began to prepare wood for the winter . and to make all things snug about the house and barn .
any young girl can imagine [female] 's state of mind when she `` took the stage '' that night , leaning on laurie 's arm . she knew she looked well , she loved to dance . she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ballroom . and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty .
what would alone have set a division between that man and us . if there had been no other dividing circumstance , was his triumph in my story . saving his troublesome sense of having been `` low '' on one occasion since his return . on which point he began to hold forth to [male] . the moment my revelation was finished , -- he had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune .
[female] was surprised , but agreed to it immediately , [female] succeeded no less in the real object of her civility . mr. [male] looked up , he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as [female] herself could be . and unconsciously closed his book , he was directly invited to join their party . but he declined it , observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together . with either of which motives his joining them would interfere , what could he mean ?
she caught bower and spencer exchanging a strange look , these men shared some secret that they sedulously kept from her . perhaps the [female] meant to enlighten her during their projected walk to vicosoprano . [location] and the others approached , together they climbed the little hill leading to the summit of the pass . in the village they said `` good night '' to the two guides and [female] , `` millicent ! you here ! ''
the last words were lost in a sob , and coming close to her i sat beside her . and , putting my hand on her face , turned it slightly that i might better see the big . [female] bruise on her forehead . partly hidden by the loose , dark curls which fell across it , her hair was short and thick and parted on the side . giving her a youthful , boyish look that was in odd contrast to the sudden terror in her eyes .
many days had passed since the hut was made -- how many may not be known . since i notched no stick and knotted no cord . yet never in my rambles in the wood had i seen that desolate ash heap where the fire had done its work . nor had i looked for it , on the contrary , my wish was never to see it . and the fear of coming accidentally upon it made me keep to the old familiar paths .
but those two men were hundred armed giants ; the swords flew about in their hands like the burning glaive of the archangel . they pierce with its point , strike with the flat . cut with the edge ; every stroke brings down a man . `` for the king , '' cried [male] , to every man he struck at . that is to say , to every man that fell , this cry became the charging word for the musketeers .
to olivia that long night seemed all glare and noise and confusion . she did the honours of the ballroom . she received her guests . she meted out due attention to all ; for she had been accustomed from her earliest girlhood to the stereotyped round of country society . she neglected no duty ; but she did all mechanically .
between the park and the transcontinental road there are many climbs short but severely steep . up shoots like the humps on a scenic railway , to tackle them with her uncertain motor was like charging a machine gun nest . she spent her nerve force lavishly , and after every wild rush to make a climb . she had to rest , to rub the suddenly aching back of her neck , because she was so tired . she did not take the trouble to save her brakes by going down in gear .
yet , to her guests she was bright and entertaining , not one of them had a suspicion that her life was not one of pure [male] . [male] , i am happy to say , was thoroughly miserable , the little brute was suffering torments . he was showering anonymous advice to the lovelorn on reggie byng . excellent stuff , culled from the pages of weekly papers . of which there was a pile in the housekeeper 's room .
he recollected that his light might betray him . and horrible as was the alternative , he was compelled to extinguish it . he now attempted to climb to the grate , through which he might obtain a view of what was passing without . this at length he effected , for the ruggedness of the wall afforded him a footing . he beheld in a ruinous court , which was partially illuminated by the glare of torches .
when [female] 's galliot came alongside , that brief encounter was at an end . and one of his corsairs was aloft , hacking from the mainmast the standard of [male] and the wooden crucifix that was nailed below it . a moment later and to a thundering roar of `` al hamdolliah , '' the green crescent floated out upon the breeze . [male] thrust his way through the press in the galleon 's waist . his corsairs fell back before him , making way .
not another word did they speak , neither looked into the other 's eyes . their entwined arms slackened a little in a passionless asundering . yet both felt that they must hold tight or they would fall , it was almost as if [male] 's parting taunt had uncovered their hearts to each other . and revealed to themselves their secret , they were like other children of the garden of eden . driven out and stripped naked , at the bridge they met casar .
in this way there had grown up an intimacy between bell and [female] and the young eames . and either of the girls was prepared to declare that [female] was her own and well loved friend . nevertheless , they spoke of him occasionally with some little dash of merriment . as is not unusual with pretty girls who have hobbledehoys among their intimate friends . and who are not themselves unaccustomed to the [male] of an [male] .
enscombe however was gracious , gracious in fact , if not in word . his wish of staying longer evidently did not please ; but it was not opposed . all was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another . emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation mr. [male] 's provoking indifference about it . either because he did not dance himself , or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted .
i feel today that man is at times attacked with evil as with the plague . some germ finds its way in from somewhere , and then in the space of one night death stalks in . why can not the stricken one be kept far away from the rest of the world ? i , at least , have realized how terrible is the contagion -- like a fiery torch which burns that it may set the world on fire . it struck nine , i could not get rid of the idea that amulya was in trouble .
the curious visitor , in these days , would seek in vain in the little bay of houmet for the house in which [male] lived . or for his garden , or the creek in which he sheltered the dutch sloop . the bû [male] rue no longer exists , even the little peninsula on which his house stood has vanished . levelled by the pickaxe of the quarryman , and carried away , cart load by cart load . by dealers in rock and granite .
chapter x , how sir [male] won the degree at a tournament in [location] . and there made palamides to bear no more harness in a year . then sir [male] asked him what he did in those countries . sir , he said , i came hither with sir gawaine for to be made knight . and if it please you , of your hands that i may be made knight .
in october [female] took charge again of the little house . mrs. [female] went back to england , but not until the traverses plan had been revealed , they would support the little house . as a memorial to the son who had died , it was . mrs. travers wrote , the finest tribute they could offer to his memory .
in them -- death , a more charming creature . with that one sad drawback -- i never saw , there was no other personal defect in her . she had the fine height , the well balanced figure . and the length of the lower limbs , which make all a woman 's movements graceful of themselves . her voice was delicious -- clear , cheerful , sympathetic , this , and her smile .
but what was [female] to do now with [female] ? she was little more than a baby yet . not silly from youth , but young from silliness , children must learn to walk . but not by being turned out alone in cheapside , she was relieved from some perplexity for the present . however , by the arrival of a letter from mrs. wardour to [female] . written in a tone of stiffly condescendent compassion -- not so unpleasant to [female] as to her friend .
it has been said that the doctor had managed to endear himself to the new squire before the old squire 's death . and that , therefore , the change at greshamsbury had had no professional ill effects upon him . such was the case at the time ; but , nevertheless , all did not go smoothly in the greshamsbury medical department . there was six or seven years difference in age between mr gresham and the doctor . and , moreover , mr gresham was young for his age , and the doctor old .
necessity excused stratagem , but stratagem was limited by the dread of offending [male] . he found out at last that he wanted to take a particular sketch at [male] . and one morning when mr. [male] had to drive along the [male] road on his way to the county town . will asked to be set down with his sketch book and camp stool at [male] . and without announcing himself at the manor settled himself to sketch in a position where he must see [female] if she came out to walk .
`` very willingly , '' he rejoined ; and rising , he strode a little distance up the pass . threw himself down on a swell of heath . and there lay still , i can do what he wants me to do . i am forced to see and acknowledge that , i meditated , -- that is . if life be spared me , but i feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an indian sun , what then ?
that day after school she started out for the purpose of laying the foundation for the fulfillment of a part of her plans . there was in the post office a clerk whose name was [male] . he was an awkward , rawboned young man . about six feet two inches high , until within a few months he had lived near mr. [male] . he had a yellow face , yellow hair and yellow teeth .
the living roll over upon the dead as they wound and kill each other . they work dreadful destruction upon each other ; and meanwhile the count flees with my lord yvain after him . until he comes up with him at the foot of a steep ascent . near the entrance of a strong place which belonged to the count . there the count was stopped , with no one near to lend him aid .
they should then carry on an amusing conversation on various subjects . and may also talk suggestively of things which would be considered as coarse , or not to be mentioned generally in society . they may then sing , either with or without gesticulations , and play on musical instruments . talk about the arts , and persuade each other to drink , at last when the woman is overcome with love and desire . the citizen should dismiss the people that may be with him .
for , at the same instant , the hakim seized the rein of his steed . and putting his own to its mettle , both sprung forth at once with the suddenness of light . and at a pitch of velocity which almost deprived the scottish knight of the power of respiration . and left him absolutely incapable , had he been desirous , to have checked the career of his guide . practised as sir [male] was in horsemanship from his earliest youth .
her back was toward me as i drew near . her hands were thrust into her pockets , she was evidently enjoying the soft mingling of the snow with the still . blue waters of the lake , and a girl and a snow storm are . if you ask my opinion , a pretty combination . the fact of a girl 's facing a winter storm argues mightily in her favor .
chapter xi , how the queen espied that sir [male] had slain her brother sir [male] by his sword . and in what jeopardy he was , anon therewithal the queen went unto her own chamber . and sought her coffer , and there she took out the piece or the sword that was pulled out of sir [male] head after that he was dead , and then she ran with that piece of iron to the sword that lay upon the bed . and when she put that piece of steel and iron unto the sword .
is there anything sadder in the world than the old age of vice . especially in woman ? she preserves no dignity . she inspires no interest , the everlasting repentance . not of the evil ways followed , but of the plans that have miscarried , the money that has been spent in vain . is as saddening a thing as one can well meet with , i knew an aged woman who had once been `` gay , ''
its escarpment , completely perpendicular at the southern extremity , curved a little towards the north . like a bent sheet of iron , presenting the steep slippery face of an inclined plane . the dark wall enlarged and grew ; but its entablature never ceased for a moment to be parallel with the horizon line . which was almost indistinguishable in the gathering darkness , silently , and altogether , the airy battlements ascended . no undulation , no wrinkle , no projection changed its shape or moved its place .
everything looked blooming and joyous except miss [female] . who was brown , dull , and resigned , and altogether , as mrs. [female] often said . just the sort of person for a governess . [male] did not mean to pay many such visits himself . they were a wretched waste of the evenings .
[male] shut the trap , the roar ceased . and they went on to the inner part of the mill . where the air was warm and nutty , and pervaded by a fog of flour . then they ascended the stairs , and saw the stones lumbering round and round . and the yellow corn running down through the hopper , they climbed yet further to the top stage .
to rectify the fault , thorpe dug his cant hook into the timber and threw his weight on the stock . he hoped in this manner to check correspondingly the ascent of his end . in other words , he took the place . on his side , of the preventing sliver . so equalizing the pressure and forcing the timber to its proper position .
the sight of her photograph quickened glennard 's exasperation . he was sick and ashamed of the part he was playing . he had loved her now for two years , with the tranquil tenderness that gathers depth and volume as it nears fulfilment . he knew that she would wait for him . but the certitude was an added pang , there are times when the constancy of the woman one can not marry is almost as trying as that of the woman one does not want to .
then these two brethren made a plot for taking sir [male] when in the queen 's presence . and bringing him dead or quick to king [male] . so on the morn sir agravaine and sir mordred gat to them twelve knights and hid themselves in a chamber in the castle of carlisle . where queen guenever was ; thus they plotted to take sir [female] by force . if she should have speech with him , sir [female] was no coward .
but his countenance was broad browed and intelligently formed , [male] , i later learned . was his name -- [male] spink , an englishman . he was blue eyed , fair-skinned , well grizzled , and , to the eye , a [male] fifty years of age . his reply of `` good morning , sir '' was cheery . and he smiled as he uttered the simple phrase .
i know , at any rate , that many sage matrons hold very strongly to that opinion . thinking , no doubt , that doctors ought to get themselves married before they venture to begin working for a living . mrs [female] , perhaps , regarded her own girls as still merely children . for bell , the elder , was then hardly eighteen ; or perhaps she held imprudent and heterodox opinions on this subject . or it may be that she selfishly preferred dr crofts .
as [female] always paid for the slaves he purchased of the coast tribes in hard spanish dollar . they believed him to possess an inexhaustible supply of specie . and the idea of robbing him had more than once been broached among them in their counsels . but feat and want of tact as to proper management in conducting an assault . they felt would insure the defeat of such a purpose .
`` dearest [male] , i am so glad to come to you , '' said the husband , walking up to his wife in their bed room . and taking her in his arms , `` i have been very unhappy , [female] , for the last two days , '' said she , very gravely , -- returning his kiss , but returning it somewhat coldly . `` we have both been unhappy , i am sure , '' said he , then he paused that the promise might be made to him .
now it was not shame that had held him from telling her , but rather a kind of bewilderment . the affair might hold shame , indeed , or anger . or sorrow , or complacence , but he did not know ; and he wished . as young men of decent birth should wish , to present the proper emotion on its right occasion . he had pondered on the matter continually since his father had spoken to him on saint [male] 's night .
when , however , the russians occupied buda pest , and the rigorous order was issued that all arms . uniforms , and hungarian bank notes were to be given up , whilst every one in possession of a prohibited object or a revolutionary proclamation was to be tried by court martial and shot . then indeed the good old dame ransacked all the drawers of my writing table , and crumpling up into a heap all she found there . including petöfi 's correspondence , a letter of klapka 's . the whole of my diary which i had written during the revolution .
who maketh his sun to rise upon both the just and the unjust , and surely but for the saving clause . doone glen had been in darkness . now , as i stood with scanty breath -- for few men could have won that climb . at the top of the long defile , and the bottom of the mountain gorge all of myself . and the pain of it , and the cark of my discontent fell away into wonder and rapture .
next day i set myself to get the boat . it was soon done , and the boat was brought round to the temple stairs . and lay where i could reach her within a minute or two . then , i began to go out as for training and practice : sometimes alone . sometimes with [female] , i was often out in cold .
the reader will hardly require to be told that the him in question was [male] . and that [female] 's letter was one instigating her brother to renew his love affair with [male] . and vavasor was in truth well inclined to renew it . and would have begun the renewing it at once , had he not doubted his power with his [male] . indeed it has been seen that he had already attempted some commencement of such renewal at basle .
it must have been hours later when it struck me that the sun was getting low and that by now we should be nearing the house in the woods . i said as much to [male] , he looked perplexed and agreed . we had reached a comparatively level place , the trail faint but apparent . and it surprised me that we heard no sound of life from the dense wood where our goal must be . we cast back and could see no trail forking from the one we were on .
[female] started on his day to atwater with joyful anticipation . but he jumped from [male] car and ran up the [male] front walk at three o'clock . his face anxious , he saw the [male] car at the gate . and wondered at [male] sitting dressed for leisure on the veranda . [male] opened his lips , but no word came .
in his last year at college [male] 's father . a well-known railroad magnate , had come a disastrous cropper in the stock market . thus throwing buck upon his own resources and cutting short his college career . which was probably the very best thing that could happen to his father 's son . for a brief period -- perhaps five minutes -- buck had staggered under the blow .
they might , perhaps , be servants of mr. [male] . yet that did not seem probable as there was no sign of a following party . the landlord came out on to the steps beneath . and after a word or two , they slipped off their horses wearily . and led them round into the court of the inn .
nevertheless , for an instant , he was prudent , he had just escaped neatly . he had been , as the reader is aware , picked up in jondrette 's garret in company with the other ruffians . utility of a vice : his drunkenness had been his salvation . the authorities had never been able to make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber or a man who had been robbed . an order of nolle prosequi , founded on his well authenticated state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush .
mary was delighted to see more of her country , she had traveled very little . but was capable of gathering ten times more from a journey to cornwall than most travelers from one through [location] itself . the place to which they went was lonely and lovely , and [male] . for the first few days , enjoyed it unspeakably , but then , suddenly , as was not unusual . mr. [male] was taken ill. for some reason or other .
with its end she saw what it had been made of . the ascendency of youth and sex over his subjugated judgment . her first impulse was to try and maintain it -- why not use the protective arts with which love inspired her ? she who lived so keenly in the brain could live as intensely in her feelings . her quick imagination tutored her looks and words .
also , this evening , after dark , mr. [male] put block and tackle on the first section of the bridge . heaved it out of place , and lowered it upon the poop . likewise he hoisted in the ladder at the break of the poop that leads down to the main deck . the men will have to do some climbing if they ever elect to rush us . i am writing this in my watch below , i came off duty at eight o'clock .
stupid as i always have been , and must ever be no doubt , i could well have told uncle reuben that his journey was no wiser than that of the men of gotham . that he never would get from hugh [male] whichehalse a warrant against the doones . moreover , that if he did get one , his own wig would be singed with it . but for divers reasons i held my [male] . partly from youth and modesty , partly from desire to see whatever please god i should see .
theo found herself saying it after marguerite to the beating of her heart . er [location] , er [location] nicht . er [location] , -- and there she stopped . breathlessly , for the box door opened , and [female] oglethorpe entered . it was fully a quarter of an hour before he left lady [male] and came to her side .
this she had been prepared for when she entered the house . but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic . and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury . and their card parties , she had not been prepared to have [male] succeed mr. [male] . but he was actually hurried off by miss bates .
she had written her letter with great care . when the offer was made to her , she could not bring herself to throw lady [female] to the winds and marry the man . as it were , out of her own head , lady [female] had been the tyrant of her life . and so she strove hard to obtain her tyrant 's permission . she used all her little cunning in showing that , after all , mr gazebee was not so very plebeian .
i will turn to a fresh page and give you the answer immediately . but you must excuse one thing -- you must excuse my beginning . mr. [male] , with an expression of surprise at the interest which you appear to have felt in my late daughter . it is quite unaccountable to me , if that interest makes you anxious for any particulars of her early life . i must refer you to mrs. [female] , who knows more of the subject than i do .
he took off his robe now , and rolling it up . tied it across his back with the cord he had worn around his waist . aura 's tunic was too short to impede her swimming and when the very young man was ready . they waded out into the water together , they found the lake no deeper than to aura 's shoulders . but as it was easier to swim than to [female] , they began swimming .
thus did the view appear , seen through the enchantment of distance . but there came a time when distance was to melt for me . when i was to be called down from my watch tower of the nursery . whence i had hitherto made my observations . and was to be compelled into closer intercourse with this little world of the rue fossette .
her very daintiness and preciosity of speech indicated it . for where a man becomes stupid and silent , a woman covers her emotions with words and a clever speech . not in vain is a proud spirited girl stared down in such a contest of looks . brave deeds simply told by a friend are potent to win interest in advance . a straight , muscular figure , a brown skin , a clear , direct eye .
a word too must be said of [female] before we begin our story . [female] is the heroine of this little tale . and the reader must be made to have some idea of her as she would have appeared before him had he seen her standing near her uncle in the long room upstairs of the hotel at granpere . [female] had been fifteen when she was brought from epinal to granpere , and had then been a child . but she had now reached her twentieth birthday .
a demure little jersey cow came scuttling down the lane and five seconds later mr. [male] arrived . if `` arrived '' be not too mild a term to describe the manner of his irruption into the yard . he bounced over the fence without waiting to open the gate . and angrily confronted astonished [female] , who had risen to her feet and stood looking at him in some bewilderment . mr. [male] was their new righthand neighbor and she had never met him before .
closer to him pressed the mystery . until the beating of her heart was a living pulse against him . and then -- suddenly , as an irresistible impulse closed his arms to hold the spirit to him . his eyes were drawn to the heart of the fire . and he saw there for an instant , wide-eyed and speaking to him , the face of yellow bird the indian sorceress .
at last she saw [female] coming , and she ran downstairs to warn her father and [female] . they , laughing at her anxiety and gravity . came with her into the hall , the man servant came hastening to the door . and there he was , relieving [female] of her umbrella . and then of her raincoat , the welcoming party hung back till their visitor entered the hall .
[male] and [male] lynn are very dashing sparks indeed . and colonel dent is a fine soldierly man , mr. [male] . the magistrate of the district , is gentleman like : his hair is quite white . his eyebrows and whiskers still dark , which gives him something of the appearance of a `` pere noble [male] theatre . '' lord ingram , like his sisters .
i was surprised , and joyfully , that she was so much the woman . and the display of each trait and mannerism that was characteristically feminine gave me keener joy . for i had been elevating her too highly in my concepts of her . removing her too far from the plane of the human , and too far from me . i had been making of her a creature goddess like and unapproachable .
as opposed to the maternal ideas , he had a certain virile idea of childhood on which he sought to mould his son . wishing him to be brought up hardily , like a spartan , to give him a strong constitution . he sent him to bed without any fire . taught him to drink off large draughts of rum and to jeer at religious processions . but , peaceable by nature , the lad answered only poorly to his notions .
[male] opened the screen door diffidently , speculating as to whom he would confront in the kitchen . then he stopped , arrested on the doorsill , at the wooden table near the pantry window stood delight hathaway . her sleeves rolled to the elbow , and her slender figure enveloped in a voluminous gingham pinafore that covered her from chin to ankle and was tied in place at the back by a pert bow . she was sifting flour into a mammoth yellow bowl . and as she stirred the mixture the sweep of her round white arm brought a flood of color into her cheeks and wreathed her brow with tiny , damp ringlets .
the last of the patriarchs had been so seized by assault , and required so much room to catch an idea in . an so much more room to turn it in , that he had not a word to offer in reply . he appeared to be meditating some patriarchal way out of his delicate position . when mr [male] , once more suddenly applying the trigger to his hat . shot it off again with his former dexterity , on the preceding occasion .
i saw the marble cup ; the tea . hung on the air , an amber stream . i saw the fire 's unglittering gleam , the painted flame . the frozen smoke , no more the flooding lamplight broke on flying eyes and lips and hair . but lay , but slept unbroken there , on stiller flesh , and body breathless .
what scorn had there been upon her face when she spoke of the beginning of their married miseries . with what eloquence of expression had she pronounced him to be vile . worthless , unmanly ; a thing from which a woman must turn with speechless contempt . she had now his name , his rank . and his money , but she was friendless and alone , [male] clavering declared to himself that she had deserved it and .
louis trevelyan felt that he had disgraced himself . he had meant to have been strong , and he had , as he knew . been very weak , he had meant to have acted in a high minded , honest , manly manner . but circumstances had been so untoward with him , that on looking at his own conduct . it seemed to him to have been mean , and almost false and cowardly , as the order for the exclusion of this hated man from his house had been given .
she had brought with her various cheques . all drawn by [male] on his banker , -- amounting altogether to many hundreds of pounds . which it was intended that [male] should use from time to time for the necessities of his trial . [male] explained that the money was in fact to be a loan from lady [male] 's father . and was simply passed through his banker 's account , but [male] knew that the loan must come from lady [male] .
she had created a shipwreck which she did regret most bitterly . but the sorrow and the regret were not humiliating , as they would have been had they been caused by failure on her own part . and then she had behind her the strong comfort of her own rock . of which nothing should now rob her , -- which should be a rock for rest and safety . and not a rock for shipwreck , and as to the disposition of which aunt [female] 's present ideas were so very erroneous !
with the sun hanging low on its western limit , the expanse of the grass lands framed in the counter scarps of the rising ground took on a gorgeous and sombre aspect . a sense of penetrating sadness , like that inspired by a grave strain of music . disengaged itself from the silence of the fields . the men we met walked past slow . unsmiling , with downcast eyes , as if the melancholy of an over burdened earth had weighted their feet .
when i consider every thing that grows holds in perfection but a little moment . that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment . when i perceive that men as plants increase . cheered and checked even by the self same sky , vaunt in their youthful sap . at height decrease , and wear their brave state out of memory .
with much surprise in his face , the man departed and a few moments after the door noiselessly opened and miss muir came in . it had been a very warm day , and for the first time she had left off her plain [female] dress . all in white , with no ornament but her fair hair , and a fragrant posy of violets in her belt . she looked a different woman from the meek . nunlike creature one usually saw about the house , her face was as altered as her dress .
captain [male] put away the fishing net upon which he was working . and welcomed them joyfully , in the searching light of the spring evening he looked older than [male] had ever seen him . his hair had grown much grayer , and the strong old hand shook a little . but his blue eyes were clear and steady , and the staunch soul looked out through them gallant and unafraid . captain [male] listened in amazed silence while [male] said what he had come to say .
little may had never known a sorrow , and in fact existence had but one bugbear for her . that was , the fates in the shape of her parents . had decreed that she should not marry , nor engage herself positively , until she had met a certain young gentleman . upon whom like commands had been imposed by his equally solicitous parents , the name . it must be confessed , impressed may favorably -- [female] ; there was something manly about it .
her face was , however , so full of love and confidence . that [female] felt no uneasiness at the state of silent abstraction into which she often fell . if she did but love him , all would yet go right ; and it was better not to press for confidence on that one subject which must be painful to both . there came a fine , bright , balmy day , and [male] tottered once more out into the open air . leaning on [male] 's arm , and close to his beating heart .
the elder mrs. [female] appeared at the door of her room . curiosity and disapproval struggling with each other in her face . but curiosity triumphed , with a protesting snort she followed [female] to the door of the locked room . dicky unlocked the door with a flourish and stood aside for [female] to enter , i gasped as i caught my first sight of the transformed room . dicky had not exaggerated -- it was wonderful , the paper had been taken from the walls .
i prescribed to her a course of reading . she had a little selection of english classics . a few of which had been left her by her mother , and the others she had purchased with her own penny fee . i lent her some more modern works ; all these she read with avidity . giving me , in writing , a clear summary of each work when she had perused it .
gabriel , seeing that neither of the three was in a fit state to take charge of the waggon for the remainder of the journey . made no reply , but , closing the door again upon them . went across to where the vehicle stood , now getting indistinct in the fog and gloom of this mildewy time . he pulled the horse 's head from the large patch of turf it had eaten bare . readjusted the boughs over the coffin , and drove along through the unwholesome night .
the merriment increased from that moment , and when the general surprised my lady by gallantly saluting her as she unconsciously stood under the mistletoe . the applause was immense , everyone followed the old gentleman 's example as fast as opportunities occurred . and the young ladies soon had as fine a color as the housemaids . more dancing , games , songs , and all manner of festival devices filled the evening . yet under cover of the gaiety more than one little scene was enacted that night .
it tasted very much like warm sweet milk , it quenched my thirst and made me feel strong . when i had eaten all i could , i cut off two large chunks of the meat and tied them to my saddle . then again shouldering the whole thing i started on my way feeling almost as satisfied as if i had my horse with me . i was lost two days , and two nights . after my horse left me and all that time i kept walking packing my 40 pounds saddle and my winchester and two cattle pistols .
gwendolen turned pink and pale during this speech , her pride had felt a terrible knife edge . and the last sentence only made the smart keener , she was conscious of appearing moved . and tried to escape from her weakness by suddenly walking to a seat and pointing out a chair to [male] . he did not take it , but turned a little in order to face her and leaned against the piano . at that moment she wished that she had not sent for him .
at a sudden impulse , he turned again towards the shore when he had crossed the bridge . and almost ran towards the verge of the land . then he threw himself down on the soft fine turf that grew on the margin of the cliffs overhanging the sea . and commanding an extent of view towards the north . his face supported by his hands , he looked down upon the blue rippling ocean .
but he had not calculated on precisely the exact kind of accident which had befallen him . and when he found himself thrown violently from his pony . in the middle of a road at once hard , [male] , and newly repaired with very sharp stones . he was both hurt and angry , it did not take him a great deal of time to get the pony on its legs . and shake himself to rights again ; but the delay .
this was all the preparation i received for that visit . or for others like it ; miss havisham never wrote to me . nor had i ever so much as seen her handwriting , we went down on the next day but one . and we found her in the room where i had first beheld her . and it is needless to add that there was no change in satis house .
the colonel made no mistake in deciding for ranald 's quarters . they consisted of two rooms that formed one corner of a long . wooden , single story building in the shape of an l. one of these rooms ranald made his dining room and bedroom . the other was his office , the rest of the building was divided into three sections . and constituted a dining room , reading room , and bunk room for the men .
when a chap has got money , he may do what he likes . [male] has got lots of money , you know . the young clerk in question was by no means on intimate terms with mr. [male] . but there had grown up in the office a way of calling him [male] behind his back . which had probably come down from the early days of his scrapes and his poverty .
the next that was known of him was in a low drinking place , where he was seen lying on the floor , dead drunk . and from that day he sank lower and lower , till one of the commonest sights to be seen in santa [male] was angus phail reeling about . tipsy , coarse , loud , profane , dangerous . in the rare intervals when he was partially sober , he sold all he possessed . ship after ship sold for a song .
[female] did not care for her [female] , but hated the discomfort of having her father displeased . so she took up her tale of adventure . and told her father and mother of her afternoon 's proceedings . [male] pretended not to listen at first , and made ostentatious noises with his spoon and glass . but by and by he got quite warm and excited about the doings of the press gang .
he opened his eyes wide at that , and there was the face of one of the ministers bobbing against the sky . flushed and breathless , yet indomitable , bawling aloud as he trotted along to keep pace with the horse . `` good people '' -- ( at the sound of his voice . high and broken , the silence became absolute , a thin crowing of a cock from far off in the country came like a thread and ceased ) , good people : i die here as a catholic man .
he had won her , against that penniless young jackanapes . lawyer [male] 's son . who had treated him with marked contempt on more than one occasion when they happened to come across each other in malsham corn exchange . which was held in the great covered quadrangular courtyard of the chief inn at malsham . and was a popular lounge for the inhabitants of that town .
indeed they are very delightful apples , and mrs. [male] does them full justice . only we do not have them baked more than twice , and mr. [female] made [female] promise to have them done three times . but miss [female] will be so good as not to mention it , the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking . beyond a doubt ; all from donwell -- some of mr. [male] 's most liberal supply . he sends [male] a sack every year .
even [female] 's anger lost its importance . she leaned her head against the window sill . and gave herself up to the flood of tender old recollections that swept over her . memory went back to the years of her childhood when she had sat in this pew every sunday with her mother . [female] had come then , too , always seeming grown up to salome by reason of her ten years ', seniority .
and she bestowed on him a parting shot in the shape of one of her prettiest young fop waves of the hand . and was gone from him , when the door closed behind her and sir [male] returned to the table . for a while a sort of dulness fell upon the party . not being of quick minds or sentiments , these country roisterers failed to understand the heavy cloud of spleen and lack of spirit they experienced . and as they filled their glasses and tossed off one bumper after another to cure it .
[female] -- trying to see me ? she lowered her hands to the desk . and sat looking at him with open wonder , he saw the irrelevance of his question . and burst , in spite of himself , into youthful laughter . a silence fell between them , [female] rose slowly . her eyes screened under the veil she had lowered .
it communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable and extraordinary power . it fills the first comer with the force of events . it converts everything into projectiles . it makes a cannon ball of a rough stone . and a general of a porter , if we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views .
one would describe then what , at a given time , had extraordinarily happened to it . and one would so , for instance , be in a position to tell , with an approach to clearness . how , under favour of occasion , it had been able to take over such and such a constituted . animated figure or form , the figure has to that extent . as you see , been placed -- placed in the imagination that detains it .
so i hailed with delight the little traits that proclaimed her only woman after all . such as the toss of the head which flung back the cloud of hair . and the search for the pin , she was woman . my kind , on my plane , and the delightful intimacy of kind . of man and woman , was possible , as well as the reverence and awe in which i knew i should always hold her .
if life be a war , it seemed my destiny to conduct it single handed . i pondered now how to break up my winter quarters -- to leave an encampment where food and forage failed . perhaps , to effect this change , another pitched battle must be fought with fortune . if so , i had a mind to the encounter . too poor to lose , god might destine me to gain , but what road was open ?
the soldier stood , mute and confounded , with his mother 's letter in his hand . it seemed as if every creature had been against the helpless girl whom he had made his wife . every hand had been lifted to drive her from the house that was her own . to drive her out upon the world , of which she was ignorant . a wanderer and an outcast ; perhaps to drive her to a cruel death .
enough to let out a `` yes '' and `` no , '' and `` a not please you , sir . '' but the wide mouth was one soft curve of rich red lips . and the skin , if not white and fair , was of an ivory smoothness and delicacy . if the look on her face was , in general , too dignified and reserved for one so young . now , talking to her father , it was bright as the morning .
not exactly his servants , nor yet his equals ; bold in his defence . first in the breach , covering all retreats , busy with his business . and devoted to him just so long as their illusions last , or until the moment when they have got all they wanted . some of these satellites perceive the ingratitude of their great man . others feel that they are simply made tools of .
mexico saved much by her treaty , spite of having to acknowledge herself beaten . but [location] lost all , words can not tell the sting of such a transfer . it is a marvel that a mexican remained in the country . probably none did , except those who were absolutely forced to it , it gave her unspeakable satisfaction . when the commissioners , laying out a road down the valley .
`` and never will , i hope , i always told papa that you would certainly be one of us . '' all this took place in the drawing room of lord [female] 's house . there was no lady [female] alive , but there lived with the earl a certain elderly lady . reported to be in some distant way a [female] of the family . named miss [female] , who , in the matter of looking after lady [female] .
raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes . who by a strange fancy , although she bore no resemblance . reminded him of his poor little [male] , whom he had left in the chateau [male] valliere and whom . in the midst of all the party , he had never for one moment quite forgotten . meantime [male] had drawn near to the coadjutor .
`` my lord , '' said the parson of [male] . plucking up something of his past energy , as the color rose to his face . i think you are wrong in this , i think you are especially wrong to interfere with me in this way on your first coming among us . you feel it to be your duty no doubt . but to me it seems that you mistake your duty .
as this conversation passed but a few hours before [location] took leave of his father . it was deeply impressed on his mind : when , therefore , belcour came with him to the place of assignation with [male] . he directed him to enquire of the french woman what were miss temple 's expectations in regard to fortune . [location] therefore concluded it was impossible he should ever marry [male] temple . and what end he proposed to himself by continuing the acquaintance he had commenced with her .
[female] had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the prince [male] conde . who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of saint [male] with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from rueil . in whatsoever direction it might be , now , since [male] did not constitute a body of horsemen . since he was alone , since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint [male] . no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way .
i will not say to you a word as to the injury in a worldly point of view which would come to you from any rupture with your husband . i believe that you can see what would be the effect of so terrible a step quite as plainly as i can show it you . you would break the heart of your father . and send your mother to her grave ; -- but it is not even on that that i may most insist . it is this , -- that you would offend your god by the worst sin that a woman can commit .
the scots , their distribution of barley being made . cared very little whether there was or was not any meat in coldstream , monk , little accustomed to barley cakes . was hungry , and his staff , at least as hungry as himself , looked with anxiety right and left . to know what was being prepared for supper , monk ordered search to be made . his scouts had on arriving in the place found it deserted and the cupboards empty .
have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead . think not of that which perishes , gaze steadily , you will perceive the living light of your well beloved dead in the depths of heaven . he knew that faith is wholesome , he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man . by pointing out to him the resigned man , and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star . like all old men , and like the majority of thinkers .
when at last , late that evening , i managed to get [female] alone for a moment . she could no more be induced to talk of herself than if she had been a ghost without visible existence . a mere voice , to speak of others , [female] by preference . what a heroine [female] had been from first to last , and what did i think now about the foolishness of that theory . the theory that [male] was a spy .
as her own voice rang out , [female] 's screams ceased . and then she saw [male] dragging himself to his knees . at her calls there came a sudden surge in the pack . and those who could not get at [female] leaped upon the remaining three , with a cry [female] fell upon her knees beside [male] . clasping his head in her arms , holding him in the protection of her own breast as they looked upon the terrible scene .
if i were being forced into such a marriage as poor little jean 's . i would kill myself , but in the eyes of god . who made love , no matter how i may appear in the eyes of man . who made marriage , i know that i am doing right . say that to [male] and [male] , say that to my wife .
inside that rolling box , turning towards that recovered presence with her heart too full for words she felt the desire of tears she had managed to keep down abandon her suddenly . her half mournful , half triumphant exultation subside . every fibre of her body , relaxed in tenderness . go stiff in the close look she took at his face . he was different , there was something , yes , there was something between them .
such sailing , it was a madness of speed and motion . for the elsinore drove over and through and under those huge graybeards that thundered shore ward . there were times , when rolls and gusts worked against her at the same moment . when i could have sworn the ends of her lower yardarms swept the sea . one chance in ten ? it was one in a hundred as we fought to weather the last bold tooth of rock that gashed into sea and [female] between [female] and open ocean .
[female] tried , but her fierce and heavy temper held her back . she could not go to her father for reconciliation . and the matter might have ended quite differently , but suddenly , without another word . [male] put on his hat and went out to join `` his chaps '' who were waiting for him about the public house , close to the cab rank in the vauxhall bridge road .
that movement from the nizhni to the ryazan . tula , and kaluga roads was so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that direction . and demands were sent from petersburg for kutuzov to take his army that way . at tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a reprimand from the emperor for having moved his army along the ryazan road . and the emperor 's letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied near kaluga .
ah , well , it was immense ; yes , it was a daisy . i do not know that i ever put a situation together better , or got happier spectacular effects out of the materials available . the blacksmith -- well , he was simply mashed , land ! i would not have felt what that man was feeling . for anything in the world , here he had been blowing and bragging about his grand meat feast twice a year . and his fresh meat twice a month , and his salt meat twice a week .
it had not even paid to vanquished royalty the honor of treating it as an enemy . and of shedding its blood , in the eyes of despotic governments . who are always interested in having liberty calumniate itself . the revolution of july committed the fault of being formidable and of remaining gentle . nothing , however , was attempted or plotted against it , the most discontented , the most irritated .
how could [male] help himself ? it is offensive to tell a lady when she is expressing her amazement at your skill . that she is altogether mistaken and rather foolish in her amazement , and to have entered into the nature of diseases would only have added to his breaches of medical propriety . thus he had to wince under a promise of success given by that ignorant praise which misses every valid quality . mr. [male] acquiesced at once , and entered strongly into the view that an illness of his was no ordinary occasion for medical science . `` never fear , sir ; you are not speaking to one who is altogether ignorant of the vis medicatrix , ''
`` i think i will go up stairs , '' said [female] . `` are you afraid of me , flo ? '' [female] answered reproachfully . `` let me see the outside of them . '' then [female] brought them round the table . and put them into her sister 's hands .
what had i to reproach in her ? nothing , she had written to say she was unwell . when she might have said to me quite crudely , with the hideous frankness of certain women . that she had to see a lover ; and , instead of believing her letter . instead of going to any street in [location] except the rue d'antin . instead of spending the evening with my friends , and presenting myself next day at the appointed hour .
give me good news of your foot and all that is above it . i am so doubtful of its being really strong yet ; and its willing spirits will overcome it some day and do it an injury . and hurt my feelings dreadfully at the same time , my dearest . [female] is still eating up all my time and energies . i promised you there should be austerity and self denial in the matter of letter writing .
out of its insularity it made occasional excursions to dinners and week ends . even into marriage , now and then with an outlander , but almost always it went back . eager for its home of dressing room and footlights . of stage entrances up dirty alleys . of door keepers and managers and parts and costumes .
after [female] had gone with the breakfast things and the money . kent recalled a number of his species . and he knew that under their veneer of apparent servility was a thing of courage and daring which needed only the right kind of incentive to rouse it . and when roused , it was peculiarly efficient in a secretive , artful dodger sort of way . it would not stand up before a gun , but it would creep under the mouths of guns on a [male] night .
[female] , i am sending a slight token , too , do you think you would like her if you knew her ? i meant to write to you from the city . daddy , but [location] is an engrossing place . i had an interesting -- and illuminating -- time , but i am glad i do not belong to such a family ! i should truly rather have the [female] grier home for a background .
here i was prevented from hearing the remainder of her speech . by the appearance of a very handsome young woman , who was ushured into the room at the door of which i had been listening . on hearing her announced by the name of `` lady [female] , '' i instantly quitted my post and followed her into the parlour . for i well remembered that she was the lady . proposed as a wife for my [female] by the cruel and unrelenting baronet .
it let me into a six feet wide strip between a long counter and the wall . taken off a spacious , vaulted room with a grated window and a glazed door giving daylight to the further end . the first thing i saw right in front of me were three middle-aged men having a sort of romp together round about another fellow with a thin . long neck and sloping shoulders who stood up at a desk writing on a large sheet of paper and taking no notice except that he grinned quietly to himself . they turned very sour at once when they saw me .
to make [female] stand well with [female] was an aim that had no rival but one in pete 's reckoning . to make [male] stand well with [male] . out of the shadow land of his memory of the awful night of his bereavement . a recollection , which had been lying dead until then , came back now in its grave clothes to torture him . it was what casar had said of [male] 's fight with ross [male] .
[female] , the next day , woke to a humiliated memory of the previous evening . darrow had been right in saying that their sacrifice would benefit no one . yet she seemed dimly to discern that there were obligations not to be tested by that standard . she owed it , at any rate . as much to his pride as to hers to abstain from the repetition of such scenes .
we camped that night at the foot of the hills we had been approaching for two days and which marked the southern boundary of this particular sea . our animals had been two days without drink . nor had they had water for nearly two months . not since shortly after leaving thark ; but , as tars tarkas explained to me . they require but little and can live almost indefinitely upon the moss which covers barsoom .
durrance fetched up his luggage from rathmullen the next day . and stayed at the farm for a week , but up to the last hour of his visit no further reference was made to [female] feversham by either ethne or durrance . although they were thrown much into each other 's company , for dermod was even more broken than mrs. [female] 's description had led durrance to expect . his speech was all dwindled to monosyllables ; his frame was shrunken . and his clothes bagged upon his limbs ; his very stature seemed lessened .
and he brought [male] safe through our time of anguish . he left [male] every one of our little ones . one november sunday , when all the fields were in a mist . and the rain came pouring softly and incessantly upon the patient earth which had been so torn and dried up by east winds . that she seemed glad enough to put aside the mockery of [female] and melt in quiet tears .
but one morning she received a letter . saying that next week he meant to come up to town . he wanted to see her about a plan which he had in his head . and , moreover , he intended to treat himself to a little doctoring . as he had begun to come round to her opinion .
houses have their own ways of dying . falling as variously as the generations of men , some with a tragic roar . some quietly , but to an after life in the city of ghosts . while from others -- and thus was the death of wickham place . the spirit slips before the body perishes , it had decayed in the spring .
after explaining these particulars to me at a private interview yesterday . mr. [male] suggested , in his most amiable manner . that i should open the necessary negotiations today . feeling that resistance was useless , unless i could first obtain [female] 's authority to make it . i consented to speak to her , but declared , at the same time , that i would on no consideration undertake to gain her consent to sir [male] 's wishes .
when he reached the stud farm a glance showed him that the horse was not what he wanted . nevertheless he took a turn behind it in order to prove to himself that he was not in a hurry . but at three o'clock he shook out the reins over the trotters and turned into the by roads leading to portsmouth . the wind had dropped and a faint haze on the horizon showed that a fog was waiting to steal up the saconnet on the turn of the tide . but all about him fields and woods were steeped in golden light .
when phillotson got back into the house he went upstairs and opened the window in the direction the omnibus had taken . soon the noise of its wheels died away , he came down then . his face compressed like that of one bearing pain . he put on his hat and went out , following by the same route for nearly a mile . suddenly turning round he came home .
but presently i flung myself down again on the warm sand , in the breeze . on the coarse dry grass , it took it out of me to think i had been so much at fault . that i had unwittingly but nonetheless deplorably trifled , but i had not given her cause . distinctly i had not , i had said to mrs. prest that i would make love to her . but it had been a joke without consequences and i had never said it to tita bordereau .
they all joined in lamenting his danger and deprecating his exile . and the princess was so much [female] with the tumult of grief and indignation that she retired to her apartment . they continued with their kind inviter a few days longer . and then went to find the hermit , they came on the third day . by the direction of the peasants , to the hermit 's cell .
`` come with me , mctavish , '' he said to his woods boss . they passed through a narrow gap between two low hills and emerged in a long narrow valley where the redwood grew thickly and where the smallest tree was not less than fifteen feet in diameter and two hundred and fifty feet tall . mctavish followed at the master 's heels as they penetrated this grove . making their way with difficulty through the underbrush until they came at length to a little amphitheatre . a clearing perhaps a hundred feet in diameter .
( we forgot to mention that at the door they wanted to put off [male] like the rest . but [male] , showing himself , pronounced merely these words . `` the king 's order , '' and was let in with his friend . ) the poor fellows had enough to do , and did their best , to reply to the demands of the customers in the absence of their master . leaving off drawing a stitch to knit a sentence ; and when wounded pride .
under these circumstances i remained solitary , i smelt the rich scent of the heating spices . and admired the shining kitchen utensils , the polished clock . decked in holly , the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper . and above all , the speckless purity of my particular care -- the scoured and well swept floor . i gave due inward applause to every object .
with an outburst of weeping she buried her head on her knees . he hoped that this passionate weeping might relieve her excitement . meanwhile he was inwardly picturing in much embarrassment how he should present himself with her in park lane . the course which he had at first unreflectingly determined on , no one kinder and more gentle than lady [female] . but it was hardly probable that she would be at home .
she had the very air of a competent housekeeper . her clothes were the clothes of a housekeeper . and so was the way she did her hair . having delivered herself of her ultimatum with an acerbity that turned sweet on the way . and accompanied it by a peremptory gesture of dismissal that had the [female] and loving kindness of a benediction .
in the fifteenth century , the seine bathed five islands within the walls of [location] . louviers island , where there were then trees , and where there is no longer anything but wood . l'ile aux vaches , and l'ile notre dame , both deserted , with the exception of one house . both fiefs of the bishop -- in the seventeenth century . a single island was formed out of these two , which was built upon and named l'ile [male] .
fish say , they have their stream and pond . but is there anything beyond ? this life can not be all , they swear . for how unpleasant , if it were , one may not doubt that , somehow , good shall come of water and of mud . and , sure , the reverent eye must see a purpose in liquidity . we darkly know , by faith we cry .
a rich young nobleman at [organization] , who , having all the resources of wealth and rank at his disposal . chose in these times to devote himself to scholarly pursuits . made in the minds of his fellow collegians a singular and eccentric figure . but that one , more splendidly endowed by fortune than any other , should so comport himself . and yet no man find it possible to deride or make coarse jokes on him .
she was the governess of little [female] meryon . whose father held the august position of general commanding the frontier forces . and her mother the more commanding position of the reigning beauty of northern [location] , generally speaking . no one disputed that , she was as pretty as a picture . and her charming photograph had graced as many illustrated papers as there were illustrated papers to [female] .
under a white mulberry tree there was an old wagon seat . beside it lay a book and a workbasket . `` you must have the seat , alexandra . the grass would stain your dress , '' the hostess insisted , she dropped down on the ground at alexandra 's side and tucked her feet under her . [female] sat at a little distance from the two women .
now i had enough of that underground work . as before related , to last me for a year to come ; neither would i . for sake of gold , have ever stepped into that bucket . of my own goodwill again , but when i told lorna -- whom i could trust in any matter of secrecy . as if she had never been a woman -- all about my great descent .
ogilvy had carried a small leather bag to and from [female] poundstone 's office . that bag was readily explained , it had contained a bribe in gold coin and young [male] had been selected as the go between . that meant that mayor poundstone had agreed to deliver the franchise . for a consideration ; and like the smooth scoundrel he was . he wanted his bit in gold coin .
it amused her considerably to notice how mademoiselle therèse flew from one party to another . during the whole of the walk , evidently feeling that she was the chaperon of each individual . she started out beside the widower , but soon interrupted his conversation by dashing off to give a word of warning to the boys . and what was supposed to be a word of encouragement to [male] . who was walking with [male] , the niece , and the widower 's eldest son .
he said with the deliberate intonation of a man who does not expect that his request will be granted . besides the beans were fried salt pork . boiled potatoes , canned corn , mince pie . a variety of cookies and doughnuts . and strong green tea , [male] found himself eating ravenously of the crude fare .
these , indeed , were so obvious that he could not very well miss them . the boy 's essential childishness , the thing that had added an aspect of horror to his habits of stealth and cruelty , gradually disappeared . he began to grow up , i mean that his mind grew up , for he had already shown a premature physical development . practically the space of a single term had changed him from a child into a man . considine , seeing this , innocently flattered himself upon the admirable results of his educational system .
i suppose , madam , your consent is not requisite in this case . nor , mr. [male] , your resignation ; nor , sir wilfull , your right . you may draw your fox if you please . sir , and make a bear garden flourish somewhere else ; for here it will not avail . this , my lady wishfort , must be subscribed , or your [female] daughter 's turned adrift .
lord [male] courcy had raised certain moneys on the family property . which he could not have raised without the co operation of his heir . and had bound himself , in return for that co operation . to pay a certain fixed income to his eldest son , this he regarded as an allowance from himself . but lord porlock regarded it as his own , by lawful claim .
[male] and [male] were married before the leaves fell in that same year . by the minister of the next village , who rode over in his chaise . and brought his wife , who was also a bride , and wore her wedding dress of a pink and pearl shot silk . but young [female] wore the blue bridal array which had been worn by old squire adams 's bride . all remodelled daintily to suit the fashion of the times ; and as she moved .
this marring of the [female] of home . by long hours of discontent , was what [female] was unprepared for . she knew , and had rather revelled in the idea , that she should have to give up many luxuries . which had only been troubles and trammels to her freedom in [female] street . her keen enjoyment of every sensuous pleasure , was balanced finely , if not overbalanced .
aunt maud 's intervention was all sharp now . and the other point , the great one , was that it was to be . in this light , either all put up with or all declined , yet at the winter 's end . nevertheless , she could scarce have said what stand she conceived she had taken . it would not be the first time she had seen herself obliged to accept with smothered irony other people 's interpretation of her conduct .
a queer greeting , certainly , but when i strove to question him as to its meaning . his voice returned to me from such a distance that i doubted if my words had reached him with any more distinctness than his answer reached me . though the open door made a draft which was anything but [male] . i did not feel like closing it , and was astonished to observe the effect of the mist through the square thus left open to the night . it was not an agreeable one , and , instinctively turning my back upon that quarter of the room .
to pete , building the gallery was a more serious business , he had not bannon 's years of experience at bridge repairing . it had happened that he had never been called upon to put up a belt gallery before . and this idea of building a wooden box one hundred and fifty feet long and holding it up . thirty feet in air , on three trestles , was formidable . bannon 's nonchalant air of setting about it seemed almost an affectation .
he , too , had discussed with his friends the condition of the coalition . and had come to conclusions rather adverse to sir [male] than otherwise , when , therefore , the first secretary sounded him as to the expediency of some step in the direction of a firmer political combination than that at present existing . by which of course was meant the dethronement of the present prime minister . mr. [male] had snubbed him ! then there had been slight official criminations and recriminations , till a state of things had come to pass which almost justified the statement made by the duchess to mrs. finn .
i turned and looked at my father in law . his expression was that of a schoolboy begging for a holiday . his head was a little on one side , his lips were parted in an insinuating smile . it was a weak moment with me . so far as such a term can be applied to such an event , the wedding ceremony .
the arrangements completed , [male] returned at the first opportunity to [male] to take [male] away . gerhardt , who had been brooding over his approaching loss , appeared most solicitous about her future . `` she should grow up to be a fine girl , '' he said . you should give her a good education . she is so smart , he spoke of the advisability of sending her to a lutheran school and church .
then by degrees she told it all . and [female] was there for hours listening to her story . the reader will not care to hear more of it than he has heard . nor would [male] have desired any closer revelation ; but as it is often difficult to obtain a confidence . so is it impossible to stop it in the midst of its effusion .
`` you might give an `` overflow '' performance out here afterwards , '' suggested the duke , grimly , this idea flashed on her a better . why not give her performance here and now ? -- now , so eager was she for contact . as it were , with this crowd ; here , by moonlight . in the pretty glow of these paper lanterns , yes , she said .
he was not quite sure whether she heard this latter sentence before she went to the brook to wash her palette . she came back rather flushed , but looking perfectly innocent and unconscious , he was glad of it . for the speech had slipped from him unawares . a rare thing in the case of a man who premeditated his actions so much as [male] . the aspect of home was all right and bright when they reached it .
`` god knows , '' [male] answered , but his tone expressed a meaning different from that generally conveyed in the words . a meaning which the mother caught at once , and rested on , `` ay -- you are right , he knows ! '' and so they went away together , almost content , next morning . i woke late ; the [male] falling across my bed , and the sparrows chattering loud in the ivy . i had been dreaming , with a curious pertinacity , of the old days at rose cottage .
he wrote [male] address upon one of his own cards . and gave it to [male] ; and then prepared to take his departure . he had an idea that the bailiff 's daughter would conduct him to the gate . and that he would be able to make some inquiries about mr. [male] on his way . it is possible that [male] guessed his intentions in this respect .
he remembered lady treherne 's words . `` if you were well , i would gladly give my girl to you . '' this inspired him with strength , endurance , and a happiness which could not be concealed . it overflowed in looks , words , and acts . it infected everyone , and made these holidays the blithest the old abbey had seen for many a day .
d'artagnan was known to this valet de chambre , who was no other than bernouin , and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the gascon a dozen times to the cardinal . the gascon , therefore , instead of answering , growled out `` ja , ja ! '' in the most german and the least gascon accent possible , as for [male] , on whom [male] had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend . which was to follow [male] in his visit to [male] . he was simply mute , all that he was allowed to say , in case of emergencies .
when the girl accepts the embrace , the man should put a `` tambula '' or screw of betel [female] and betel leaves in her mouth . and if she will not take it , he should induce her to do so by conciliatory words . entreaties , oaths , and kneeling at her feet . for it is an universal rule that however bashful or angry a woman may be . she never disregards a man kneeling at her feet .
a woman , in oscar 's position . would have been able to relate to us , not only the whole conversation with the rector . but every little trifling incident which had noticeably illustrated it . as things were , we could only extract from our unsatisfactory man the barest outline of the interview . the coloring and the filling in we were left to do for ourselves .
then in a sudden motion , she lifted her arms and rushed sheer upon the long horned bullocks . in shuddering irregular runs , pausing for a second and looking at them , then lifting her hands and running forward with a flash . till they ceased pawing the ground , and gave way . snorting with terror , lifting their heads from the ground and flinging themselves away . galloping off into the evening , becoming tiny in the distance , and still not stopping .
he had been informed at seven o'clock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle . he had hastened to [male] 's chamber . had found it empty , the window open , and the bars filed . had remembered the verbal caution [male] had transmitted to him by his messenger . had trembled for the duke , and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled .
the wheeled chair had its associated remembrances and reveries . one may suppose , as every place that is made the station of a human being has . pictures of demolished streets and altered houses . as they formerly were when the occupant of the chair was familiar with them . images of people as they too used to be .
after that she left [female] to manage the `` retreat , '' and devoted her energies to the little folks , always so ready to receive the smallest gift and repay the giver with their artless thanks . here she found plenty to do , and did it with such sweet goodwill that she won her way like [female] . making many a little heart dance over splendid dolls . gay picture books , and pots of flowers .
will [male] was struck mute for a few moments . he had never been fond of mr. [male] . and if it had not been for the sense of obligation . would have laughed at him as a bat of erudition . but the idea of this dried up pedant , this elaborator of small explanations about as important as the surplus stock of false antiquities kept in a vendor 's back chamber .
the scene was the corner of [male] street in budmouth regis . near the king 's statue , at which point the white angle of the last house in the row cut perpendicularly an embayed and nearly motionless expanse of salt water projected from the outer ocean . today lit in bright tones of green and opal , [female] and smart had just emerged from the street . and there on the right , against the brilliant sheet of liquid colour . stood fancy day ; and she turned and recognized him .
meanwhile she , using her liberty , as i said . to the utmost extent , had soon plunged into the midst of the fastest set in [female] . this set into which [female] had thrown herself was the fast one . a coterie of officers , artists , the richer merchants and bankers . medical men , literati , and the young wives .
`` thank god , '' he murmured , and sank back in his chair . i guessed what his fear had been -- that [male] was no longer among the living . looking at him closely , i was shocked at the change a single day had wrought in him . his eyes were bloodshot from want of sleep . his face pale and drawn .
he came home late -- at ten o'clock , at midnight sometimes . then he asked for something to eat , and as the servant had gone to bed . emma waited on him , he took off his coat to dine more at his ease . he told her , one after the other , the people he had met . the villages where he had been , the prescriptions he had written .
so taught by love and sorrow , jo wrote her little stories . and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her . finding it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers . for they were kindly welcomed , and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother . like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes .
then , with a yell , the boys leap up , or break away from their standing . they toss their caps to the black beamed roof . and haply the very books after them ; and the great boys vex no more the small ones . and the small boys stick up to the great ones , one with another , hard they go . to see the gain of the waters , and the tribulation of cop .
some wheeled to the right and some to the left , and some obliging men . including cripplestraw , tried to wheel both ways , many of the company who had been drilled preferred to go off and spend their shillings instead of entering the church . but [male] and captain [male] passed in , even the interior of the sacred edifice was affected by the agitation of the times . the religion of the country had , in fact . changed from love of god to hatred of [male] .
when she sat down in the parlour , after doing scant justice to hepsey 's cooking . it was with a grim resignation , of the puritan sort which . supposedly , went with the house , there was but one place in all the world where she would like to be . and she was afraid to trust herself in the attic , by an elaborate mental process . she convinced herself that the cedar chest and the old trunks did not concern her in the least .
two years earlier , a naturalist in the highlands had engaged [male] to classify his collection . and [male] had gone to inverness with the professor 's family . she saw something then of the glories of [location] . and her memories of the purple hills . the silvery lakes , the joyous burns tumbling headlong through woodland and pasture .
having thrown a little balm upon the wound of the paternal heart . he pulled the ear of [male] . whose eyes sparkled more than usual , and regained his escort in the parterre . the horses , rested and refreshed , set off with spirit through the lovely night . and soon placed a considerable distance between their master and the chateau .
such and such like were the reasonings of sir [male] . happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture , the wonder . the reflections , the reproach that must attend it . happy to secure a marriage which would bring him such an addition of respectability and influence . and very happy to think anything of his daughter 's disposition that was most favourable for the purpose .
it needed no very subtle psychologist to read aright those separate tokens of a disordered mind . of a weary spirit which had sought distraction in a dozen occupations . and had found relief in none , it was some vague sense of this that caused [female] 's anxiety . she wished to keep strangers out of this room . in which her [female] , [female] , haggard , and weary looking .
it was a very great relief to emma to find [female] as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting . their intercourse was painful enough by letter , how much worse , had they been obliged to meet ! [female] expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches . or apparent sense of ill usage ; and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment . a something bordering on it in her style .
he put his strong arm about her body . and lifted her as if she had been a child . and finding she was so trembling that she had not strength to support herself . he even carried her to the grass and laid her down upon it . she had a lovely gipsy face which should have been brilliant with beauty .
the panther turned aside from the trail and with silent [female] leaped to the ledge . gaining a position on a level with ollie . still unconscious of its presence , a cold sweat broke out on the big man 's forehead . the great hands worked , his breath came in quick gasps . it could not be laid to his door , he had only to withdraw .
if at that supreme hour , the wedded pair , dazzled with voluptuousness and believing themselves alone . were to listen , they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling of wings . perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels . that dark little chamber has all heaven for its ceiling , when two mouths . rendered sacred by love , approach to create , it is impossible that there should not be .
never before had i seen so beautiful a woman , as i was contemplating her . with respect but yet with a masculine intentness i could not quite suppress . two or three other persons came in , and now i began to notice that the eyes of all these people turned mainly one way . and that was toward the clock , another small circumstance likewise drew my attention . whenever any one entered , -- and there were one or two additional arrivals during the five minutes preceding the striking of the hour .
but at this moment the party of the disinherited knight had the worst . the gigantic arm of front de boeuf on the one flank . and the ponderous strength of athelstane on the other , bearing down and dispersing those immediately exposed to them . finding themselves freed from their immediate antagonists , it seems to have occurred to both these knights at the same instant . that they would render the most decisive advantage to their party .
[male] finished lighting his cigarette , then took the letter up and glanced at it carelessly . at sight of the first line his expression changed to one of absolute horror . his face blanched , the perspiration sprang out upon his forehead . and the cigarette dropped from his fingers to the carpet . where it lay smouldering , nor was this wonderful , for the letter was a copy of one of [male] 's most passionate epistles to himself .
as the day was [female] , madame valmonde drove over to l'abri to see desiree and the baby . it made her laugh to think of desiree with a baby . why , it seemed but yesterday that desiree was little more than a baby herself . when [female] in riding through the gateway of valmonde had found her lying asleep in the shadow of the big stone pillar . it was no wonder , when she stood one day against the stone pillar in whose shadow she had lain asleep .
in a minute a third slave was struggling in the air . it was dreadful , i turned away my head a moment . and when i turned back i missed the king ! they were blindfolding him , i was paralyzed . i could not move , i was choking , my tongue was petrified .
[male] , one of their foremost minstrels . celebrated the event by a poem called an immortal . to [location] 's guest , in the shop windows his picture hung alongside that of bismarck . and at the theatres his plays were being produced , about this time he heard of the commotion that `` countess julie '' had created in [location] , where it had been produced by [male] .
so saying , the old gentleman got into the chaise , close to which miss [female] had detained her brother . upon the same principle that the owner of a quarrelsome dog keeps him by his side to prevent his fastening upon another . but [female] contrived to give her precaution the slip . for , as he was on horseback , he lingered behind the carriages until they had fairly turned the corner in the road to knockwinnock . and then , wheeling his horse 's head round .
i am informed by letter from dresden that you are in [location] on your way to that city with the view of spending some days with the earl of brentford . you will , of course , be once more thrown into the society of my wife , lady [female] . i have never understood , and certainly have never sanctioned , that breach of my wife 's marriage vow which has led to her withdrawal from my roof . i never bade her go , and i have bidden her return . whatever may be her feelings , or mine , her duty demands her presence here .
the church was close to the house , and he had gone back to change his coat and hat . and to get his stick , but as he was stealing out of the little side gate . sir [male] was down upon him , if your [male] is going for a walk . and will admit of company , i shall be delighted to attend you , said sir [male] . the duke professed himself to be well pleased , and in truth was pleased .
mr. [male] was better able to accomplish the task . he knew the duke 's mind . a very large discretion had been left in mr. [male] 's hands in regard to moneys which might be needed on behalf of that dangerous heir ! so large that he had been able to tell lord [male] that if the money was in truth lost according to [male] club rules . it should all be forthcoming on the settling day , -- certainly without assistance from messrs .
in the meantime , robin hood had sent off several of his followers in different directions . as if to reconnoitre the enemy ; and when he saw the company effectually broken up . he approached [male] , who was now completely armed , and , kneeling down on one knee . craved pardon of his sovereign , he then rose from his knee . folded his arm on his bosom , and in a manner rather respectful than submissive .
he was sensibly moved with this ; so he sat down again , and said a great many kind things to me . to abate the excess of my passion , but still urged the necessity of what he had proposed . all the while insisting , that if i did refuse . he would notwithstanding provide for me . but letting me plainly see that he would decline me in the main point .
it made no difference , for she was perfectly at home on horseback . and strapped the girths with trembling fingers that were icy cold with excitement . across the saddle bows she hung the two flour sacks containing her provisions . then with added caution she tied some old burlap about each of the horse 's feet . she must make no sound and leave no track as she stole forth into the great world .
it is probable that the greater number of these poems were in ms. before it occurred to [male] 's friend and banker , the honble . [male] , to make him known to [male] . a youthful composer of `` musical farces and operatic works , '' who had been destined by his parents for the hebrew priesthood . but had broken away , and , after some struggles , succeeded in qualifying himself as a musician .
i can not find words to express to you my displeasure . you command only my advance guard . and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order . you are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign . break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy , inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so .
anyone meeting the pair , as they walked with the long swinging stride of the mountaineer up the steep mill road that gray afternoon . would have turned for a second look ; such men are seldom seen , when they reached the big log house that looks down upon the hollow . the boy went at once with his axe to the woodpile . while the older man busied himself with the milking and other chores about the barn . young [male] had not been chopping long when he heard , coming up the hill .
four years afterwards -- long after the fate of [female] thorne had fallen . like a thunderbolt , on the inhabitants of greshamsbury . when [female] was preparing for her second baby , and each of the twins had her accepted lover . mr [male] gazebee went down to courcy castle . of course , on matters of business .
garth was on the step below them . handing pauline 's aunt a letter she had dropped . `` good night , miss champion , '' he said . and for one instant his eyes met hers . but he did not hold out his hand , or appear to see hers half extended .
but in the morning some of this bitterness had worn away , his last resolve overnight had been to go to the brewery before breakfast . at which period of the day mr. [male] was always to be found for half an hour in his counting house . and curtly tell the brewer that all further negotiations between them must be made by their respective lawyers . but as he was dressing , he reflected that mr. [male] 's position was certainly one of difficulty . that amicable arrangements would still be best if amicable arrangements were possible , and that something was due to the man who had for so many years been his uncle 's partner .
it would be futile to attempt to describe her state of mind when she discovered that [female] had not learned of [female] 's presence in the house . but , being quick sighted , and keen of sense , she began to comprehend at last . and it was priscilla gower who assisted her to a clearer state of mind . two days later , when , after a visit to his patient . the little doctor was preparing to take his departure , priscilla gower addressed him suddenly .
it seemed to me that some mysterious adventure might easily be waiting in the ruined and deserted roman town on the desolate moor . or even just round the mossy trunk of the next oak in the forest drive , through which the knight was riding . or that any fair lady or questing dog which he might meet could turn out to be a wizard seeking to work woe upon him . nevertheless , i was always sure that in those bright days when the world was young . whatever evil power might get the mastery for a little while .
on the appointed day mrs. [female] and [female] met me at the station . i politely saw them off , i politely saw madame [female] off by the same train . the last thing at night my wife returned to blackwater . having followed her instructions with the most unimpeachable accuracy , she was accompanied by madame [female] . and she brought me the [location] address of mrs. [female] .
everything about him tended to confirm him in the custom of looking on himself as an elderly man . from whom such aspirations as he had combated in the case of [male] ( though that was not so long ago either . reckoning by months and seasons ) , were finally departed , his relations with her father and mother were like those on which a widower son in law might have stood . if the twin sister who was dead had lived to pass away in the bloom of womanhood . and he had been her husband , the nature of his intercourse with mr and mrs [female] would probably have been just what it was .
[female] morbidly sensitive nature adapted her to all charitable offices . no chance word in her simple talk ever inflicted a wound upon the listener . she had a subtle and intuitive comprehension of other people 's feelings . derived from the extreme susceptibility of her own , she had never been vulgarised by the associations of poverty . for her self contained nature took no colour from the things that surrounded her .
the days went on , [female] was now lady le marchant . she had written to me again , and warned me once more to be careful what i was about . she had said that she liked her life . at least she said so in her first two or three letters , and then there fell a sudden utter silence about herself . which seemed to me ominous , [male] had always acted upon the assumption that sir [male] was a far from strong minded individual .
thus he came to the dread conclusion that in his endeavours to screen himself he had but enmeshed himself the more inextricably . if [male] but spoke he was lost , and back he came to the question . what assurance had he that [male] would not speak ? the fear of this from occurring to him occasionally began to haunt him day and night . and for all that the fever had left him and his wound was entirely healed .
and then , too , there would be the greatest difficulty in wording her request to the doctor . and lady [female] was sufficiently conscious of her own weakness to know that she was not always very good at words . but the doctor , when hard pressed , was never at fault . he could say the bitterest things in the quietest tone . and lady [male] had a great dread of these bitter things .
what bryce could not understand , however , was the stupid brutality of the raiders in felling the tree merely for that section of burl . by permitting the tree to stand and merely building a staging up to the burl . the latter could have been removed without vital injury to the tree . whereas by destroying the tree the wretches had evidenced all too clearly to bryce a wanton desire to add insult to injury . bryce inspected the scars on the stump carefully .
and you never knew ? dearest , i love you for it . you never knew , i believe a man . when he finds he has won , thinks he has taken the city by assault . he does not guess how to the insiders it has been a weary siege . with flags of surrender fluttering themselves to rags from every wall and window !
but no poverty in him , and no coat on him that never was the mode . and no old men 's ward for his dwelling place . could quench his daughter 's admiration , mrs [female] was as proud of her father 's talents as she could possibly have been if they had made him lord chancellor . she had as firm a belief in the sweetness and propriety of his manners as she could possibly have had if he had been lord chamberlain . the poor little old man knew some pale and vapid little songs .
i remained leaning on the window sill for nearly a quarter of an hour . looking out absently into the [male] darkness , and hearing nothing . except now and then the voices of the servants , or the distant sound of a closing door . in the lower part of the house , just as i was turning away wearily from the window to go back to the bedroom and make a second attempt to complete the unfinished entry in my journal . i smelt the odour of tobacco smoke stealing towards me on the heavy night air .
she broke into sobs , and turned her back to him . it would almost have won round any man but angel clare . within the remote depths of his constitution , so gentle and affectionate as he was in general . there lay hidden a hard logical deposit , like a vein of metal in a soft loam . which turned the edge of everything that attempted to traverse it .
the nurse followed mr. [male] to the servants ', hall . there on their dinner table lay the poor dead body , the men who had brought it were sitting near the fire . while several of the servants stood round the table , gazing at the remains . one or two were crying ; one or two were whispering ; awed into a strange stillness of voice and action by the presence of the dead . when mr. [male] came in they all drew back and looked at him with the reverence due to sorrow .
we say to ourselves that we are a wretch and a traitor . but we feel no burden upon our spirit and no fear in our heart . and it seems to [male] that our spirit is clear as a lake troubled by no eyes save those of the sun . and in our heart -- strange are the ways of evil ! in our heart there is the first [male] we have known in twenty years .
at the mention of the home for which means were so quickly forthcoming when thorpe . not she , considered it needful , the girl 's eyes flashed . she stooped and dragged violently from beneath the bed a flat steamer trunk . the lid of which she threw open , a dress lay on the bed . with a fine dramatic gesture she folded the garment and laid it in the bottom of the trunk .
overcombe mill presented at one end the appearance of a hard worked house slipping into the river . and at the other of an idle , genteel place , half cloaked with creepers at this time of the year . and having no visible connexion with flour , it had hips instead of gables . giving it a round shouldered look , four chimneys with no smoke coming out of them . two zigzag cracks in the wall .
an hour later , in the darkness of night . two men and a child presented themselves at no . 62 rue petit picpus , the elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped . fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass words . all the doors opened , thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in .
stephen had never seen anything like that dance . many pretty premières danseuses he had admired and applauded , charming and clever young women of [location] . of [location] , of [location] , and [male] . and they had roused him and all [location] to enthusiasm over dances eccentric . original , exquisite , or wild , but never had there been anything like this .
`` have not a smattering of what they mean , '' laughed leslie . the istics scare me completely , just social ideas are all i have . thinking home better than any other place on earth . the way you can afford to have it . merely being human , kind and interested in what my men are doing and enjoying .
the dinner party , which i arranged for in the [location] restaurant . was , on the whole , a great success , my sister played hostess for me and confessed herself charmed with eve . as indeed was every one else , mr. [male] 's stories kept his end of the table in continual bursts of merriment . one little incident , too , was in its way exceedingly satisfactory , mr. and mrs. [female] were being entertained by some friends close at hand . and they appeared very much gratified at the cordiality of our greeting .
there was some one ; but the person who was there was of those whom the human eye can not see . then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp , which troubled the dreams of the sleeping man beneath him . and awoke him with a start , he now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he had arrived in turn . the two ideas which counselled him appeared to him equally fatal . what a fatality , what conjunction that that champmathieu should have been taken for him .
but half-way up the path , my progress was again stayed by the sight of a man issuing from the house i had so rashly looked upon as devoid of all human presence . he seemed in haste and , at the moment my eye first fell on him . was engaged in replacing his watch in his pocket , as we met . he raised his hat , this likewise struck me as peculiar . for the deference he displayed was more marked than that usually bestowed on strangers .
yet for that very reason think how much i loved doing it ! i am jealous of those days before i knew you . and want to have all their wild honey flavor for myself . do remember more , and tell me , dearest heart , it was to me you were coming through all your scampers and ramblings . no wonder , with that unknown good running parallel .
and this was cause enough , if no other cause existed , for partiality to mr. [male] at framley court . but , as has been partly explained , there existed , if possible , even stronger ground than this for adherence to the [female] cause . the younger lady lufton had known the crawleys intimately , and the elder lady lufton had reckoned them among the neighbouring clerical families of her acquaintance . both these ladies were therefore staunch in their defence of mr. [male] . the archdeacon himself had his own reasons .
he was not like a man to her , he was an incarnation . a great phase of life , she saw him press the water out of his face . and look at the bandage on his hand . and she knew it was all no good , and that she would never go beyond him . he was the final approximation of life to her .
[female] never pretended to bashfulness where [female] was concerned , she was not at all shy of referring to him and his dilatory courtship . indeed , it seemed to amuse her , [female] sat down again and together they watched [male] coming down the lane . gazing calmly about him at the [female] clover fields and the blue loops of the river winding in and out of the misty valley below . [female] looked at [female] 's placid . finely moulded face and tried to imagine what she herself would feel like if she were sitting there .
opening the heavy door he ascended the two or three steps to the level of the ground . and there on the gravel before him lay a white heap . phillotson seized it in his arms . and bringing sue into the hall seated her on a chair . where he gazed at her by the flapping light of the candle which he had set down in the draught on the bottom stair .
in a few hours , the maid who brought her meals . was desired by mr harleigh to inform her . that he had executed her commission at the post office . when the next day , however , and the next , passed without her seeing any of the family . she felt disconcerted and [female] , to be abandoned by [female] .
he opened his eyes , and there was a meaningless green haze through the window where the world should have been . but he heard father layonne 's voice . it seemed a great distance off , but it was very clear . doctor cardigan had made an error . it was saying , and doctor cardigan .
but when the rod in his hand had failed him . when it proved too big for a staff and too rough for a crutch . he did not attempt to break it , either from the instinct of a gentleman . or the pride of a strong man , he continued to shower his favours upon [male] . going to [location] with his wife and daughter at the beginning of the new year .
[male] , who had a general invitation to the house . was with them almost every day ; he came to look at marianne and talk to [male] . who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence . but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister . she feared it was a strengthening regard .
round this corridor i now went . entering all the halls , of which there were twelve , and finding them all similarly constructed . but filled with quite various statues , of what seemed both ancient and modern sculpture . after i had simply walked through them , i found myself sufficiently tired to long for rest . and went to my own room , in the night i dreamed that .
Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1896 to 1901 by [male] at [organization] [male] maud montgomery was born at [organization] . prince [male] island . [location] , on november 30 , 1874 , she achieved international fame in her lifetime . putting prince [female] island and [location] on the world literary map . best known for her [female] of green gables
as for the plain itself , let the reader picture to himself a vast undulating sweep of ground . each rise commands the next rise , and all the undulations mount towards mont saint jean . and there end in the forest , two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers . it is a question of seizing the opponent round the waist . the one seeks to trip up the other , they clutch at everything .
but when her mother was gone , [female] would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening . after tea , mr. [male] retired to the library . as was his custom , and [male] went up stairs to her instrument . two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs. [female] sat looking and winking at [female] and [female] for a considerable time .
at length , from a rising hill , they looked below them on the dell of holywood . the great windows of the forest [male] with torch and candle . its high pinnacles and spires arose very clear and silent , and the gold rood upon the topmost summit glittered brightly in the moon . all about it , in the open glade , camp fires were burning . and the ground was thick with huts ; and across the midst of the picture the frozen river curved .
at the end of january princess [female] left for [location] . and the count insisted on [female] 's going with her to consult the doctors . after the encounter at vyazma , where kutuzov had been unable to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so on . the farther movement of the fleeing french , and of the russians who pursued them . continued as far as [male] without a battle , the flight was so rapid that [organization] pursuing the french could not keep up with them .
theo rose from her knees with the tears scarcely dry in her eyes . she had never seen such dresses in downport before . these things of pamela 's had only come from [location] the day of [female] 's death . and had never been opened for family inspection , some motherly instinct . even in mrs. [female] 's managing economy .
but it was [male] 's now and not the stranger 's . and therefore more nearly their own than formerly , and must look different , more beautiful . with a brighter polish on the metal . and that wonderful enamelled cock on the lid . figured in [location] probably , but just like a cock in guayana .
but we beside the fire sit close to the steaming bowl . we pile the logs up higher , and loud our voices roll . when the yeoman wakes at dawn to begin his round of toil . his garner 's bare , his sheep are gone . and the dragon holds the spoil , all day long through the earth that yeoman makes his moan .
he had told all this as he had seen it for himself . until the sheriff 's men drove them all forth again into the court . and he had told , too , of all that he had heard afterwards . that had happened until my lord shrewsbury 's son had ridden out at a [organization] to take the news to court . and the imprisoned watchers had been allowed to leave the castle ; how the little dog .
[female] had turned , from her smothered lips came a choking cry of agony . [male] had now raised his automatic , it was level with his waistline . from that position he had trained himself to fire with the deadly precision that is a part of the training of the men of the royal northwest mounted . before [location] 's forefinger had pressed the trigger of his rifle a stream of fire shot out from the muzzle of the automatic . [location] did not move , then a shudder passed through him .
`` help , '' shouted the duke ; and at the same time he sprang toward his sword . but [male] did not give him time to draw it . he held the knife with which [female] had stabbed herself . open in his bosom ; at one bound he was upon the duke . at that moment [female] entered the room .
in picking the worms off the plants it is necessary to use the greatest care that the plants are not damaged . but jordan and i were afraid to touch the worms with our fingers . so we took sticks and knocked them off . also a few leaves with each worm , this fact called forth some rather strong language from father . who said we were doing more harm than good , but our aversion to the worms was so strong that we took several thrashings before we could bring ourselves to use our fingers instead of a stick .
the shepherd arranged everything for his friend 's comfort . putting things in readiness for his noonday meal . and showing him the spring , then , taking his own lunch . as his custom was , he went to the corral and released the sheep . the doctor watched until the last of the flock was gone , and he could no longer hear the tinkle of the bells and the bark of the dog .
[female] lady [female] 's visit was nominally to philippa and [female] . yet i have some reason to imagine that ( acquainted with the marriage and arrival of [female] ) . to see me was a principal motive to it . i soon perceived that tho lovely and elegant in her person and tho easy and polite in her address , she was of that inferior order of beings with regard to delicate feeling .
the porter retired into his den to meditate upon his good fortune . it was a rendezvous , of course , cunningly arranged on the day of the painter 's departure . it seemed to him like a leaf out of one of those flabby novels on large paper . with a muddy wood cut on every sixteenth page , which he thumbed and pored over now and then of an evening . [male] went up stairs , how supremely dismal the rooms looked in their emptiness .
he sat there for a long while , heedless of all that was doing about him . turning the situation over and over in his mind , like a good strategist . he was planning grady 's campaign as carefully as his own . finally he was recalled to his material surroundings by a rough voice which commanded . `` get off that keg and clear out , we do not allow no loafers around here . ''
above or love -- hope -- hate -- or fear . it lives all passionless and pure . an age shall fleet like earthly year ; its years as moments shall endure . away -- away -- without a wing , o'er all -- through all -- its thought shall fly . a nameless and eternal thing , forgetting what it was to die .
bower , who owned certain strong qualities , swallowed something . took three strides downward , and said calmly : i was waiting to give [location] a hand . he is lame , you know , [male] , of course . heard all that passed , she had long since abandoned the effort to disentangle the skein of that day 's events . everybody was talking and acting unnaturally , perhaps the ravel of things would clear itself when they regained the commonplace world of the hotel .
she started to her feet in an agony . a horrible fear had taken possession of her , with one arm she held the child fast to her bosom . with the other hand searched in vain to find a match . and still , as she searched , the baby seemed to grow heavier upon her arm . and the fear sickened more and more at her heart , at last she had light !
in one of these hospitals [location] lay for six weeks suffering from a severe concussion of the brain . at the end of the fourth , his fever had broken , but he was pronounced as yet too weak to be moved . his nurse was a red cheeked , blue eyed , homely little irish girl , brimming with motherly good humor . when [location] found strength to talk , the two became friends . through her influence he was moved to a bed about ten feet from the window .
lord [male] winter perceived nothing of this . when he had finished , he went to a table upon which was a salver with spanish wine and glasses . he filled two glasses , and by a sign invited [male] to drink . [male] knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him . he therefore drew near to the table and took the second glass .
she fell into a [female] dream of positions and work . behind every one of these myriad fronts she passed there must be a career or careers . her ideas of women 's employment and a modern woman 's pose in life were based largely on the figure of vivie [female] in mrs. [female] 's profession . she had seen mrs. [female] 's profession furtively with [female] from the gallery of a stage society performance one monday afternoon . most of it had been incomprehensible to her , or comprehensible in a way that checked further curiosity .
she had not spoken again , remaining as if stunned , [female] retreated over the sheaves . and descended the ladder , while the workers below rose and stretched their arms . and shook down the beer they had drunk . then the threshing machine started afresh ; and amid the renewed rustle of the straw tess resumed her position by the buzzing drum as one in a dream . untying sheaf after sheaf in endless succession .
he advanced to the parapet with several others standing respectfully behind him . it was targo -- targo triumphantly standing with uplifted arms before the people he was to rule . when the din that was raised at his appearance had subsided a little he spoke . one short sentence , and then he paused , there was a moment of indecision in the crowd before it broke into tumultuous cheers . `` the king -- he killed , '' oteo said softly .
lord mark had been brought to her before dinner . not by mrs. lowder , but by the handsome girl . that lady 's niece , who was now at the other end and on the same side as susie . he had taken her in , and she meant presently to ask him about miss croy . the handsome girl , actually offered to her sight -- though now in a splendid way .
at times it seemed to the minister that they were spending their strength for naught . and at such times he bitterly grudged , not his own toils . but those of his wife , none knew better than he how well fitted she was . both by the native endowments of her mind and by the graces of her character . to fill the highest sphere , and he sometimes grew impatient that she should spend herself without stint and reap no adequate reward .
i will well , said the knight , and then they laced up their helms . and their pages avoided , and they stepped together and fought freshly ; but the red knight of the red launds awaited him . and at an overthwart smote him within the hand . that his sword fell out of his hand ; and yet he gave him another buffet upon the helm that he fell grovelling to the earth . and the red knight fell over him , for to hold him down .
lucy smiled ; and temple saw it was a smile of approbation . he sought and found a cottage suited to his taste . thither , attended by love and hymen , the happy trio retired . where , during many years of uninterrupted felicity , they cast not a wish beyond the little boundaries of their own tenement . plenty , and her handmaid , prudence , presided at their board .
but my mind lives under the trees in the open , directly receives upon itself the messages borne by the free winds . and responds from the bottom of its heart to all the musical cadences of light and darkness . alas , nikhil , have you for ever parted company with that self of yours who used to be set free under the starlight . to plunge into the infinite depths of the night 's darkness after the day 's work was done ? how terribly alone is he , who misses companionship in the midst of the multitudinousness of life .
room by having a bandage bound over her eyes . my poor lucilla had always the bandage over her eyes . my poor lucilla was never to meet her lover in the light . she had grown up with the passions of a woman . and yet , she had never advanced beyond the fearless and primitive innocence of a child .
mr [male] 's default left a banquo 's chair at the table . but , if he had been there , he would have merely made the difference of banquo in it . and consequently he was no loss , bar , who picked up all sorts of odds and ends about westminster hall . much as a raven would have done if he had passed as much of his time there . had been picking up a great many straws lately and tossing them about , to try which way the [male] wind blew .
gerald had dived in , after sir [male] , and had swum to the end of the pond . there he climbed out and sat on the wall , there was a dive . and the little countess was swimming like a rat , to join him . they both sat in the sun , laughing and crossing their arms on their breasts . sir [male] swam up to them .
[female] jumped onshore , climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff . saluted [male] a last time , and took his course toward the city . at the end of a hundred paces , the ground began to decline . and he could only see the mast of the sloop . he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth .
tea was brought in , [male] poured out for them . it was strange how inviolable was the intimacy which existed between him and [male] . ursula felt that she was an outsider . the very tea cups and the old silver was a bond between [female] and [female] . it seemed to belong to an old , past world which they had inhabited together .
she pushed open the door and entered , followed by ethel . the interior was rough but clean , it was a small room . lighted by one tiny window looking out on the water . in one corner a rough ladder led up to the loft above , the bare lathed walls were hung with fishing jackets . nets , mackerel lines and other shore appurtenances .
the next minute he heard her stepping briskly about the kitchen . shooing out intruding cats , and humming a darky air to herself , he went reluctantly back to the shore and rowed across the river in a brown study . i do not know whether winslow was afflicted with chronic thirst or not , or whether the east side water was not so good as that of the west side . but i do know that he fairly haunted the [female] farmhouse after that . mrs. [female] was home the next time he went .
her fate was decided and happily decided , but what her father had said about mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful . it was untrue to be sure , but still it was terrible , and she could not help thinking of it . she was going straight on through the conservatory . neither seeing nor hearing anything , when suddenly the well-known whispering of mademoiselle bourienne aroused her . she raised her eyes .
hanging over the cook 's arm was a loose and crumpled array of evil looking and sour smelling garments . i had taken a dislike to him at first . and as he helped to dress me this dislike increased . there was something repulsive about his touch , i shrank from his hand . my flesh revolted , and between this and the smells arising from various pots boiling and bubbling on the galley fire .
whether i really had been down in garden court in the dead of the night . groping about for the boat that i supposed to be there ; whether i had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror . not knowing how i had got out of bed ; whether i had found myself lighting the lamp . possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs . and that the lights were blown out ; whether i had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking .
with the next stanza of the chorus , the same rich barytone notes . they seemed to float in under all the rest , and bear them along . as a great wave bears a boat , ramona had never heard such a voice . felipe had a good tenor , and she liked to sing with him . or to hear him ; but this -- this was from another world , this sound .
a great spirit wild and untaught . this rescue of the machinery of the wreck as meditated by [male] was . as we have already said , like the escape of a criminal from a prison . necessitating all the patience and industry recorded of such achievements . industry carried to the point of a miracle .
but wonder not , oh man , if events always turn out different to what we have intended . that malicious power , lurking for our destruction , gladly lulls its chosen victim to sleep with sweet songs and golden delusions . while on the other hand the rescuing messenger from heaven often knocks sharply and alarmingly at our door . scarcely , however , had she closed her eyes than every one in the vessel imagined he saw . in whatever direction he turned , a most horrible human head .
the first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man 's relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to everything coexisting with him . this is what makes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground . and that makes the actions of a man closely connected with others in a thickly populated district . or of one bound by family , official , or business duties . seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and seclusion .
he wished to goodness that she would not fuss over him . being convinced that he himself was an ordinary , plain sailing person who had submitted for long enough to an unreasonable degree of pampering . he did not see any reason why he should not be treated like any other boy of his age . and felt that he had already been cheated of many of the rights of youth . one of the principal reasons why he welcomed the lapton plan was that it would free him from the constant tug of apron strings .
the next two or three days passed uncomfortably enough with will [male] , he made his head quarters at the little inn of redicote . and drove himself backwards and forwards between that place and the estate which was now his own . on each of these days he saw colonel [male] . whom he found to be a civil [male] man . willing enough to rid himself of the unpleasant task he had undertaken .
among the houses where [female] was not quite liked , and yet invited , was quetcham hall . one of her first invitations was to a large dinner party there , which made a sort of general introduction for her to the society of the neighborhood . for in a select party of thirty and of well composed proportions as to age . few visitable families could be entirely left out , no youthful figure there was comparable to [female] 's as she passed through the long suite of rooms adorned with light and flowers . and , visible at first as a slim figure floating along in white drapery , approached through one wide doorway after another into fuller illumination and definiteness .
he spoke of his wife almost with awe . when mr. [male] left him to make this second attack . `` she has never had nothing to say to none sich as that , '' said the farmer , shaking his head , as he alluded both to his wife and to his sister . `` and i ai not sure as she will be first rate civil to any one as mentions sich in her hearing . ''
this care for domestic details in [female] . so opposed to levin 's ideal of exalted happiness , was at first one of the disappointments . and this sweet care of her household , the aim of which he did not understand . but could not help loving , was one of the new happy surprises , another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels . levin could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations could arise other than tender .
i do not deny that in certain moments of loneliness which come to us . widowers and bachelors alike , i had the impulse to tempt again the matrimonial fortune . and counting on my financial standing , together with other attractions , i ran over the eligible ladies of my acquaintance . but one was a little too old , and another was a good deal too flighty . one was too fond of society , and another did not like dogs , a fifth spoiled her chances by an unwomanly ignorance of horticulture .
now in order to bring about a marriage with such a girl as described above . the parents and relations of the man should exert themselves . as also such friends on both sides as may be desired to assist in the matter . these friends should bring to the notice of the girl 's parents . the faults , both present and future , of all the other men that may wish to marry her .
`` ask mr maguire to walk up , '' she said . and then she began to bethink herself how she would behave to him . `` oh , certainly , '' said she ; and then sitting down she waited for him to begin . it would have been clear to any observer , had there been one present . that mr maguire had practised his lesson .
a multitude of small considerations in connection with this subject . trifling enough in themselves , but strikingly important when massed together -- had latterly led my mind to a conclusion which i resolved to verify . i obtained [female] 's permission to write to [female] . of varneck hall ( where mrs. [female] had lived in service for some years previous to her marriage ) . to ask him certain questions , i made the inquiries in [male] 's name .
monsieur lieuvain then sat down ; [male] derozerays got up . beginning another speech , his was not perhaps so florid as that of the councillor . but it recommended itself by a more direct style . that is to say , by more special knowledge and more elevated considerations , thus the praise of the government took up less space in it . religion and agriculture more , he showed in it the relations of these two .
the hymn like and yet fairy like first movement ; the second , that song of universal love . joy , and thanksgiving , with [male] 's masculine hand evident throughout . to the notes there seemed to fall a [male] into the room . and we could see the fields casting their covering of snow . and withered trees bursting into bloom ; [organization] swollen with warm rain .
all at once , while he was scrutinizing the great city with that eye which nature . by a sort of compensation , had made so piercing that it could almost supply the other organs which quasimodo lacked . it seemed to him that there was something singular about the quay [male] vieille pelleterie . that there was a movement at that point , that the line of the parapet . standing out blackly against the whiteness of the water was not straight and tranquil , like that of the other quays .
she would thereby have come into her spiritual property at once , and heaven would have opened to her . a little way at least -- probably to close again for a time , now she felt crushed . the idea of undertaking that for which she knew herself so ill fitted was not merely odious but frightful to her . she was ready enough to work , but it must be real , not sham work . she must see and consult [female] , this was quite another affair from [female] !
mr. [male] had positively refused to move in the matter . and trevelyan , mad as he was , had felt a disinclination to throw his affairs into the hands of a certain mr. [male] . of stamford street , whom [male] had recommended to him as a lawyer . trevelyan had hinted , moreover , that if [male] would make the application in person . that application , if not obeyed , would act with usefulness as a preliminary step for further personal measures to be taken by himself .
out the front door she tottered and over to the stone steps . and there , summoning every fibre of her soul and body for a last effort . swung herself half around -- for a second , as she tried to loose her hold . her numb fingers clung to the rough surface , and in that second she slipped and . losing balance , toppled forward with a despairing cry , her arms still around the bowl , down .
there was no end to it , and it constantly began again . there had never been such a display of pomp , several citizens had scoured their houses the evening before . tri coloured flags hung from half open windows . all the public houses were full ; and in the lovely weather the starched caps , the golden crosses . and the coloured neckerchiefs seemed whiter than snow , shone in the sun .
and here i may remark that when mr. [male] referred to me . he considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into my eyes . i can not conceive why everybody of his standing who visited at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstances . yet i do not call to mind that i was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family circle . but some large handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronize me .
the lady whom they had come to see , if she were the present occupant of the house . appeared to have taken up her quarters there as she might have established herself in an eastern caravanserai . a small square of carpet in the middle of the room . a few articles of furniture that evidently did not belong to the room . and a disorder of trunks and travelling articles .
mrs. [female] will in the future regulate her poultry yard according to your directions . lady [female] , if you will be so condescending as to give them . no , no -- i wish nothing , [ to mr , [male] . ] but you may go . mr. [male] , and see if [male] is walking the horses up and down . i do not trust [female] , yes , your ladyship -- i have .
there ought to be a law against a woman 's making a picture of herself . unless she is willing to allow an artist to `` fix her '' properly in his gallery of types , a black-and-white sketch does not give any definite idea of this charmer 's charms . but sometime i will fill it in -- hair , sweet little hat . gown , and eyes , all in golden brown , a cape of tawny sable slipping off her arm .
son , born of your own sister . [male] , that died in the forest in the birth of me . o jesu , said king mark . ye are welcome fair nephew to me , then in all the haste the king let horse sir [male] . and armed him in the best manner that might be had or gotten for gold or silver .
i knew nothing more ; or , if i did , i had forgot it all when i awoke to consciousness . lying on the floor of the cottage , with my head in the lap of the woman . who was weeping over me , and stroking my hair with both hands . talking to me as a mother might talk to a sick and sleeping . or a dead child , as soon as i looked up and saw her .
the house , was of adobe , low , with a wide veranda on the three sides of the inner court . and a still broader one across the entire front , which looked to the south . these verandas , especially those on the inner court , were supplementary rooms to the house . the greater part of the family life went on in them . nobody stayed inside the walls , except when it was necessary .
but now -- did she know exactly what was the state of the case with regard to mrs. [female] and her children ? she had given a sort of promise . had said , `` i will not interfere with your wishes , '' but would another woman who married [female] be in fact the decisive obstacle to her wishes . or be doing her and her boy any real injury ? might it not be just as well . nay better , that [female] should marry ? for what could not a woman do when she was married .
mrs. [female] was sorry , but resolved to adhere to the arrangement . the night came on ; and it having gone abroad that the king would pass by the road . many of the villagers went out to see the procession , when the two lovedays and mrs. [female] were gone . [female] bolted the door for security . and sat down to think again on her grave responsibilities in the choice of a husband .
both , now tell me pray , and tell me true . what in the world should the do ? both , now tell me pray . and tell me true , what in the world should the do ? from the briny sea comes young [male] , all victorious ! valorous is he -- his achievements all are glorious , let the welkin ring with the news we bring sing it . shout it -- tell about it -- safe and sound returneth he .
[female] had her own opinion about that as she hastened into the house to write a note at [organization] desk . `` it 's so very important , '' [male] assured him anxiously . the mail carrier was a rather grumpy old personage who did not at all look the part of a messenger of cupid . and [male] was none too certain that his memory was to be trusted , but he said he would do his best to remember and she had to be contented with that . charlotta the fourth felt that some mystery pervaded the stone house that afternoon .
then those who still watched , and who spread the tale about afterwards , saw that the squire did not move from his seat to kneel down . he had put off his hat again after the homily . and had so sat ever since ; and now that the minister came to him . still there he sat , now such a manner of receiving was not unknown ; yet it was the sign of a puritan . and , so far from the folk expecting such behaviour in their squire .
i have not been really willing before to write down in this wretched volume that i took that garment to the city with me and what madame rene did to it . remade it into the loveliest thing i ever saw . only i would not let her alter the size one single inch . i am honourable , as all women are at peculiar times , i think she understood . but she seemed not to , and worked a miracle on it with ribbon and lace .
when [male] croy said to him as much he besought her not to insist . declaring that this indeed was what was too much the matter with him , that he had been but too probably spoiled for native . for insular use , on which , not unnaturally , she insisted the more , assuring him . without mitigation , that if he was complicated and brilliant she would not for the world have had him any thing less . so that he was reduced in the end to accusing her of putting the dreadful truth to him in the hollow guise of flattery .
white ruffles at the wrists drooped over her delicately veined hands and showed only the occasional flash of a ring and her perfectly manicured finger tips . summer or winter , fair weather or foul . madam [female] never varied this costume , and it seemed to possess some measure of its owner 's eternal youth . for it was always fresh and its lustrous folds always swept the ground in the same dignified fashion . indeed for those who knew madam [female] to think of her in any other guise would have been impossible .
so off [female] went , she was very much inclined to play some pranks when she was dressed up at such an unusual hour . to make her rich white silk balloon out into a cheese . to retreat backwards from her mother as if she were the queen . but when she found that these freaks of hers were regarded as interruptions to the serious business . and as such annoyed her mother , she became grave and sedate .
there were many other gentlemen in the room , and some who knew mr. [male] with more or less intimacy . he , however , took notice of no one . and when one friend , who had really known him well , came up behind and spoke to him gently leaning over his chair . the poor man hardly recognized his friend , `` i am sure your husband wo not forget me , '' said mr. [male] , the clergyman of framley .
years afterwards , in conversation with [male] . he was startled by a chance expression which dropped from his mother 's lips . it implied a knowledge of [male] crime . it was many a long day since they had seen any manchester people who could have revealed the secret ( if indeed it was known in manchester . against which [male] had guarded in every possible way ) , and he was led to inquire first as to the extent .
just as prince [male] met [male] and zherkov . there came toward them from the other end of the corridor . strauch , an austrian general who on kutuzov 's staff in charge of the provisioning of the russian army . and the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening . there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily .
after all , it had too many associations with license and indulgence . weak things were often beautiful , weak things were never good , and in this new loneness of his that had been selected for what greatness he might achieve . beauty must be relative or , itself a harmony . it would make only a discord , in a sense this gradual renunciation of beauty was the second step after his disillusion had been made complete . he felt that he was leaving behind him his chance of being a certain type of artist .
in discovering [male] sage , mr. [male] had achieved one of his greatest strokes of good fortune . when minister of supply his notice had been attracted to sage . as the man who had been instrumental in bringing to light -- that is official light . for the affair was never made public -- the greatest contracts scandal of the war . it was due entirely to his initiative and unobtrusive enquiries that a gigantic fraud .
as days passed on [female] too heard of the supposed engagement between [female] and [female] . and for once kept silent upon the subject , at least in [female] 's presence . dearly as she loved to discuss such matters , she felt there was something in the character of her new friend which forbade an approach to anything like jesting about so personal an affair as one 's own engagement . she , however , fully believed the report , for everything she saw tended to confirm it . and she was anxious to return home that she might carry the important news to [female] and [female] , poor [female] !
the judicious parent , having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing . had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle , and had informed mr. [male] that his wife was `` a treasure for a prince . '' mr. [male] had invested the prince 's treasure in the ways of the world ever since . and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest . still , mrs. [male] was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity .
`` oh , god save you , '' mrs. meg cried in a pet . and so for [female] 's letter there was no more search . but indeed they would not have found it , when he woke . the world was grey , he could survey himself cynically and wonder why he had been such a fool as to be in a fluster overnight . faith , it was a grand exploit to dabble in conspiracies and come out with your head still on your shoulders .
before christmas [female] had gone to ramage again and accepted this offer she had at first declined . many little things had contributed to that decision , the chief influence was her awakening sense of the need of money . she had been forced to buy herself that pair of boots and a walking skirt . and the pearl necklace at the pawnbrokers had yielded very disappointingly , and , also , she wanted to borrow that money . it did seem in so many ways exactly what ramage said it was .
some minutes after that the funeral company reappeared , it made for the open grave in the corner by the wall . the cover was removed , the coffin was lowered , the policeman half lifted his helmet . and the sexton put a careless hand to his cap . then the curate opened a book and closed it again . the burial service was at an end , half an hour longer the sexton worked alone in the drenching rain .
i was just saying that i have stopped living haphazard . one can not go through a great deal of -- she missed out the noun -- without planning one 's actions in advance , i am going to have a child in june . and in the first place conversations , discussions , excitement . are not good for me , i will go through them if necessary , but only then .
king [male] had hurried up the army business altogether beyond my calculations . i had not supposed he would move in the matter while i was away . and so i had not mapped out a scheme for determining the merits of officers . i had only remarked that it would be wise to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination . and privately i meant to put together a list of military qualifications that nobody could answer to but my west pointers .
presently she heard him send off mrs. [female] for the night . saying he should want no supper , and should be going to bed soon , then the house became quiet . and the smell of tobacco smoke came floating up the stairs . [female] 's hot breath on her hands grew damp against her face . she felt herself swooning , and she caught hold of the mantelpiece .
and the shirts stood out from the chests like cuirasses ! everyone had just had his hair cut . ears stood out from the heads ; they had been close shaved . a few , even , who had had to get up before daybreak , and not been able to see to shave . had diagonal gashes under their noses or cuts the size of a three franc piece along the jaws .
your last letter was quite enough to make me worry about you . it was not a bit like yourself . reading between the lines i should imagine that your engagement to this girl is making you rather unhappy . and i see you have lost all the feeling of romance that you had before the war . you make a great mistake if you think you can be romantic without religion .
[male] , who had not been at all responsive to his discourse . now swayed heavily against him , and looking quickly down he found that she had silently fainted . to support her in his arms was of course the impulse of a moment . there was no water to be had , and he could think of nothing else but to hold her tenderly till she came round again . certainly he desired nothing more , he waited .
the fierce flame fluttered like a silk flag . throwing an angry swaying glare mingled with moving shadows over the poop . lighting up the concave surfaces of the sails . gleaming on the wet paint of the white rails , and young [male] turned his eyes to windward with a catch in his breath . the strange ship , a darker shape in the night .
then in great wrath they drew back with their horses . and rushed together as it had been the thunder , the [male] knight 's spear brake . and fair hands thrust him through both his sides . whereupon his own spear brake also , nevertheless the [male] knight drew his sword and smote many eager strokes of great might . and hurt fair hands full sore , but at the last he fell down off his horse in a swoon .
there was a curious wooden box in front at one side of . the big desk , and a girl sat before it pushing down some [female] and white strips that looked like sticks . and making her feet go , and singing with all her might , the curious box made music . the same music the people were singing , was it a piano , she wondered . she had heard of pianos .
on the next day we left fulham for a quiet town on [location] . at that early season of the year we were the only visitors in the place . the cliffs , the beach , and the walks inland were all in the solitary condition which was most welcome to us . the air was mild -- the prospects over hill and wood and down were beautifully varied by the shifting april light and shade . and the restless sea leapt under our windows .
so when the king came thereas they were , he saw sir gawaine and sir gareth sit upon a little hill side . and then the king avoided his horse , and when he came nigh sir gareth he would have spoken but he might not . and therewith he sank down in a swoon for gladness . and so they stert unto their uncle , and required him of his good [male] to be of good comfort . wit ye well the king made great joy .
she read it very hurriedly twice , and then all at once comprehended that [female] was going away for some years . for ever , -- it was all the same thing ; and that she would never . never , never , never , -- the word seemed to repeat itself in her brain like the dreadful clanging of a bell . never see him again , mr. [male] stood for some moments staring at the doorway through which [male] had disappeared . with the open letter in his hand , and his face a perfect blank in the intensity of his amazement .
how wise was the advice of the old doctor to make short work of the confession to his mother . and to face the matter of his marriage bravely with his august friends and connections . [male] little knew , if his marriage had been rash in its haste . nothing in the future should be done rashly , possibly he might be obliged to return to [male] before he made a full revelation that a wife awaited him in that far and but dimly appreciated land . in his mind the matter resolved itself into a question of time and careful adjustment .
the parlor was a big room , with a dutch stove . and a screen dividing it into two , under the holy pictures stood a table painted in patterns . a bench , and two chairs , near the entrance was a dresser full of crockery . the shutters were closed , there were few flies , and it was so clean that levin was anxious that [female] . who had been running along the road and bathing in puddles .
just at this period [female] would come to her often ; -- sometimes full of a new decision to forget violet effingham altogether . at others minded to continue his siege let the hope of success be ever so small . he had now heard that violet and lord [male] had in truth quarrelled . and was of course anxious to be advised to continue the siege , when he first came in and spoke a word or two . in which there was no reference to violet effingham , there came upon madame goesler a strong wish to decide at once that she would play no longer with the coronet .
without more ado i published it . it was a loyal , patriotic article on purely constitutional lines . showing in the most matter of fact way in the world the justice and the necessity of a constitutional government for [location] . on account of this article , the governor brought both the count who wrote it and the editor who inserted it before a court martial . he signified to the pair of [male] beforehand that he meant to lock [male] up for three months for it .
when coffee was served felicite went away to get ready the room in the new house . and the guests soon raised the siege , madame lefrancois was asleep near the cinders . while the stable boy , lantern in hand , was waiting to show [male] and madame bovary the way home . bits of straw stuck in his red hair , and he limped with his left leg . when he had taken in his other hand the cure 's umbrella , they started .
young as she was , [female] had touched the whole pulse of social england . she had no ideas of rising in the world . she knew , with the perfect cynicism of cruel youth . that to rise in the world meant to have one outside show instead of another . the advance was like having a spurious half crown instead of a spurious penny , the whole coinage of valuation was spurious .
i have once more to acknowledge the generous assistance of the officials of [organization] . and , more especially , of mr. [male] , of the oriental printed books and mss . department , who has afforded me invaluable instruction in the compilation of the notes to the [male] and bride of [male] . i have also to thank mr. [male] . of the department of prints and drawings .
i drew for myself rough outlines of the interior of glenarm house as it had appeared to me . and then i tried to reconcile the little sketch with every part of it . all was quiet in the great cellar ; only here and there an area window rattled dolorously . i carried a tape line with me and made measurements of the length and depth of the corridor and of the chambers that were set off from it . these figures i entered in my note book for further use .
he relapsed again into gloom , i , on the contrary . became more cheerful , and took fresh courage : these last words gave me an insight as to where the difficulty lay . and as it was no difficulty with me . i felt quite relieved from my previous embarrassment , i resumed a livelier vein of conversation . `` it is time some one undertook to rehumanise you , ''
she need hardly have asked , for he had hurried round to the door before she had half finished speaking . and , only murmuring , i am sorry , ', fled precipitately . she was really rather sorry for him . he looked so abjectly miserable , nevertheless , she took the precaution of locking the door and putting the key under the mat . she went downstairs more slowly than she had come up , for the boy 's visit had made her feel rather queer .
nothing very long abides , as the greatest of all writers ( in whose extent i am for ever lost in raptured wonder . and yet for ever quite at home , as if his heart were mine , although his brains so different ) . in a word as mr. [male] . in every one of his works insists , with a humoured melancholy . and if my journey to [location] led to nothing else of advancement .
the picnic seemed quite a tame thing after these reveries in the carriage . the orphans met their uncle at the lodge gate . and they all went across the grass , just as they had gone before . to the little low iron gate which mr. [male] was privileged to open with a special key . and into the grove , where the wonderful beeches and oaks made a faint summer darkness .
philip had not found that way out , yet she did not blame him . she had begun to see that the deepest shame of their relation was not hers but his . since she had lived in [male] 's house the man in him had begun to decay . she could not shut her eyes to this rapid demoralisation . and she knew well that it was the consequence of her presence .
he went to the ground , crushing the human serpent under him . and he continued to strike and choke as he had never struck or choked another man . all other things overwhelmed by his mad desire to tear into pieces this two legged english vermin who was too foul to exist on the face of the earth . and he still continued to strike -- even after the path lay clear once more between him and the river . he heard running feet , he saw figures approaching swiftly through the starlight .
as she raised the letter to the light of the candle . miss [female] turned from the balustrade , looked doubtfully up and down the terrace . advanced a step towards the glass doors . and then stopped , facing us , i started up from the ottoman before miss [female] could pronounce the next words . a thrill of the same feeling which ran through me when the touch was laid upon my shoulder on the lonely high road chilled me again .
nuflo , poor old man , loved a big fire dearly . a big fire and fat meat to eat ( the ranker its flavour . the better he liked it ) were to him the greatest blessings that man could wish for . in me also the prospect of a cheerful blaze put a new heart . and i worked with a will in the rain , which increased in the end to a blinding downpour .
in the vast silence of the wood , the lightest sounds were audible from far . and alicia , who was keen of hearing . held up her finger warningly and stooped to listen , all followed her example ; but besides the groans of the choked brook in the dingle close behind . and the barking of a fox at a distance of many miles among the forest . to [female] 's acutest hearkening , not a breath was audible .
but the old lady got up nevertheless , for she knew crooked [female] would be coming early to finish the garden . she arranged her beautiful . thick , white hair very carefully , and put on her purple silk dress with the little gold spots in it . the old lady always wore silk from motives of economy . it was much cheaper to wear a silk dress that had belonged to her mother than to buy new print at the store .
you can not know how i dreaded appearing in school in those miserable poor box dresses . i was perfectly sure to be put down in class next to the girl who first owned my dress . and she would whisper and giggle and point it out to the others . the bitterness of wearing your enemies cast off clothes eats into your soul . if i wore silk stockings for the rest of my life .
colonel [male] was now as happy , as all those who best loved him . believed he deserved to be ; -- in [male] he was consoled for every past affliction . her regard and her society restored his mind to animation . and his spirits to cheerfulness ; and that [female] found her own happiness in forming his . was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend .
all this made me very uncomfortable , for many and many reasons , the chief and foremost being of course my anxiety about lorna . if the attack succeeded , what was to become of her ? who would rescue her from the brutal soldiers . even supposing that she escaped from the hands of her own people . during the danger and ferocity ? and in smaller ways . i was much put out ; for instance , who would ensure our corn ricks .
but that the sky had never ceased , for more than two days at a time . for full three weeks thereafter , to pour fresh piles of fleecy mantle . neither had the wind relaxed a single day from shaking them . as a rule , it snowed all day . cleared up at night , and froze intensely , with the stars as bright as jewels .
however , i knew one thing for certain , to wit , that the longer i stayed debating the more would the enterprise pall upon me . and the less my relish be , and it struck me that , in times of [male] . the middle way was the likeliest ; and the others diverging right and left in their farther parts might be made to slide into it . at the pleasure of the warders , also i took it for good omen that i remembered a very fine line in the latin grammar . whose emphasis and meaning is `` middle road is safest . ''
she had recovered from her emotion , and walked along beside him with a grave , subdued face . [male] did not like to assume the privileges of an accepted lover and draw her hand through his arm . for , conscious that she naturally belonged to a politer grade than his own . he feared lest her exhibition of tenderness were an impulse which cooler moments might regret . a perfect paul and virginia life had not absolutely set in for him as yet , and it was not to be hastened by force .
yes , these were characteristic sounds ; they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes . which such buildings had witnessed , and such storms ushered in ; and most heartily did she rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn ! she had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken gallants . [male] had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning . in a house so furnished , and so guarded , she could have nothing to explore or to suffer .
soon i forgot about [female] and annie ; and fell to thinking of lorna only . and how much i would make of her ; and what i should call our children . and how i would educate them , to do honour to her rank ; yet all the time i worked none the worse . by reason of meditation , fresh cut spars are not so good as those of a little seasoning . especially if the sap was not gone down at the time of cutting , therefore we always find it needful to have plenty still in stock .
and she answered the question , absolute , intrinsic . acknowledged , individual merit must give it to its possessor . let him be whom , and what , and whence he might . so far the spirit of democracy was strong with her , beyond this it could be had but by inheritance . received as it were second hand , or twenty second hand , and so far the spirit of aristocracy was strong within her .
he watched the growth of hunger . the increasing poverty and distress of [location] during that spring . and assigned it to its proper cause . together with the patience with which the people bore it . the world of [location] was in a state of hushed .
she soothed him ; asked him for his forgiveness if she had been . or seemed to have been , undutiful ; told him , heaven knows truly , that she could not honour him more if he were the favourite of fortune and the whole world acknowledged him . when his tears were dried , and he sobbed in his weakness no longer . and was free from that touch of shame , and had recovered his usual bearing . she prepared the remains of his supper afresh .
fifty persons were waiting for the superintendent , he did not even take the time to place himself in the hands of his valet [male] chambre for a minute . but from the perron went straight into the premier salon . there his friends were assembled in full chat , the intendant was about to order supper to be served . but , above all , the abbe [male] watched for the return of his brother . and was endeavoring to do the honors of the house in his absence .
mr. [male] moved through the dimly lighted chamber with all the cat-like stealthiness of an accomplished valet . arranging the various articles of his master 's wardrobe . and giving , so far as he was able , the semblance of an accustomed spot to this new and strange locality . already , indeed , it was very unlike what it had been during [location] 's occupation . guns , whips , fishing tackle , dog leashes , and landing nets had all disappeared .
for some moments after this there was a dead silence , and [male] saw the young man standing opposite him in the dusk . motionless as a stone figure . white as death , then after that pause , which seemed so long , [male] stretched out his hand and groped among the decanters and glasses on the table for a water jug . he filled a goblet with water . and [male] knew , by the clashing of the glass .
magnitski , addressing himself to [male] . was relating an anecdote , and [male] was laughing in advance at what magnitski was going to say . when prince [male] entered the room magnitski 's words were again crowned by laughter . stolypin gave a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese . [male] laughed softly with a hissing chuckle .
on the return of the good woman , who had accompanied madame to the village on the preceding night . [female] went to the cottage at farrini . her grateful heart would not suffer her to depart without taking leave of her faithful friends . thanking them for their kindness , and informing them of her future prospects . they had prevailed upon her to spend the few intervening hours at this cot .
never before had the sensation presented itself , but , once set up , it ran through all his susceptibilities . by an absurd freak of fancy those varying eyes seemed to pierce through his lids . almost through his eyeballs , the cold perspiration that was his daily horror broke out on his forehead . and at the same moment fraide , his leader . turned , leaned over the back of his seat , and touched his knee .
their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from miss elliot would give [female] . and [female] lost no time in going , she mentioned nothing of what she had heard . or what she intended , at home , it would excite no proper interest there . she only consulted lady russell , who entered thoroughly into her sentiments . and was most happy to convey her as near to [female] 's lodgings in westgate buildings .
a whimsical smile played at the corners of his mouth . those curtains he had kept tightly drawn , one of them was down now . but the other was raised two inches , so that one hidden within the cabin could watch the approach from the trail ! he drew back , and under his breath he chuckled . he recognized the sheer nerve of the thing .
he arranged a pile of wood in front of the stove and covered it with a blanket which he pulled from one of the bunks . then , still on his knees , he drew the cane chair close to the fire and covered it with a second blanket . a few moments later marette was tucked comfortably in this chair . with her bare feet on the blanketed pile of wood . kent opened the stove door , then he extinguished one of the smoking candles .
when on the first day he got up early , went out of the shed at dawn . and saw the cupolas and crosses of the new convent of the virgin still dark at first . the hoarfrost on the dusty grass , the sparrow hills . and the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance . when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying from [location] across the field .
bee took up a book and began to turn over the pages . `` if you are annoyed , '' i went on , `` i must make a shift to fill up the vacancy . '' today i have filled it up , this photograph of mine was taken in my early youth . my face was then fresher , and so was my mind , then i still cherished some illusions about this world and the next . faith deceives men , but it has one great merit .
i met this attorney , and gave him all the particulars at large . as they are recited above ; and he assured me it was a case . as he said , that would very well support itself , and that he did not question but that a jury would give very considerable damages on such an occasion . so taking his full instructions he began the prosecution . and the mercer being arrested , gave bail , a few days after his giving bail .
the whole party is most anxious for your co operation , if this be so , -- and i make you the assurance from most conclusive evidence . you are bound to accept the common consent of your political friends on that matter . you perhaps think that at a certain period of your life you failed . they all agree with me that you did not fail . it is a matter on which you should be bound by our opinion rather than by your own .
she pointed , my eyes followed her hand . and i saw it too , a living figure was moving over the waste of heath in the distance . it crossed our range of view from the boat house . and passed darkly along the outer edge of the mist . it stopped far off , in front of us .
so , it has come to pass that the spring van is strewing flowers on the [male] hours and on the staircase . and that [male] is surveying the ground on which he is to play his distinguished part tomorrow . he has already been to the church , and taken note of the various impediments in the aisle . under the auspices of an extremely dreary widow who opens the pews . and whose left hand appears to be in a state of acute rheumatism .
here , clearly , was a new legatee ; else why was he bidden as a mourner ? here were new possibilities , raising a new uncertainty , which almost checked remark in the mourning coaches . we are all humiliated by the sudden discovery of a fact which has existed very comfortably and perhaps been staring at [female] in private while we have been making up our world entirely without it . no one had seen this questionable stranger before except [female] . and she knew nothing more of him than that he had twice been to stone court when mr. [male] was down stairs .
she had to wait a tedious hour before she saw a flivver rattling up with the garage man . who was not a man at all , but a fourteen year old boy , he snorted . rats , you did not need to send for me . could have made it perfectly safe , come on , never has the greatest boy pianist received such awe as claire gave to this contemptuous young god . with grease on his peachy cheeks .
the russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times . it was a war of good sense . for real interests , for the tranquillity and security of all . it was purely pacific and conservative , it was a war for a great cause . the end of uncertainties and the beginning of security .
he took the sea lamp from its swinging frame and handed it to me . he began at the first bunks forward on the star board side . in the top one lay oofty oofty , a kanaka and splendid seaman . so named by his mates , he was asleep on his back and breathing as placidly as a woman . one arm was under his head , the other lay on top of the blankets .
he carried his sixty years as if they had been fewer than forty . he sauntered along , wearing his hat a little on one side . with a light jaunty step , swinging his big stick , humming to himself . looking up from time to time at the houses and gardens on either side of him with superb , smiling patronage . if a stranger had been told that the whole neighbourhood belonged to him .
and now we will pay a little visit to the small one born in the purple . and the story of that visit shall be the end of our history . it was early in april , quite early in april . and mr and mrs grey were both at gatherum castle . mrs grey was there at the moment of which we write .
mr [male] , in whom these impersonal compliments produced an irresistible sheepishness . never rallied after such a charge , he could only bite his nails and puff away to the next defaulter . the responsive bleeding hearts would then gather round the defaulter whom he had just abandoned . and the most extravagant rumours would circulate among them , to their great comfort . touching the amount of mr [male] 's ready money .
reconciled , they turned to the baby , he was pale . his eyes were closed , and they could not tell whether he breathed . in a horrible fright , [male] for the doctor . before he returned with him , the child had come to . and the doctor could discover no injury from the fall they told him he had had .
also there is one beautiful [female] and the angel there by a painter whose name i most ungratefully forget . i saw a man yesterday carrying fishes in the market . each strung through the gills on a twig of [male] . that is how [male] ought to carry his fish : when a native custom suggests old paintings . how charming it always is , we have just got here from verona .
from this day alessandro was a changed man . hope had died in his bosom , in all the village councils . and they were many and long now , for the little community had been plunged into great anxiety and distress by this doctor [male] 's affair . alessandro sat dumb and gloomy , to whatever was proposed , he had but one reply . `` it is of no use , we can do nothing . ''
three seconds more , and with a savage curse , hadden had remounted the pony and was riding for his life towards the river . which a while later he crossed in safety . for a long distance she was borne thus till at length she saw that she was in a forest . for trees cut off the light from the water . and their drooping branches swept its surface .
once she stopped and stared with unseeing eyes at the blue sky . and once under the heavy helplessness of it all she dropped on the side of the road and sat with her head buried in her arms . sat so long that she rose with a start and , with an apprehensive look at the mounting sun , hurried on . she would go to the gap and teach . and then she knew that if she went there it would be on [female] 's account .
it was bright as it used to be bright in old days . and he was smiling on her as he used to smile . my own , he said ; -- my wife -- my own ! and she had no longer the power to deny him . `` not yet , [female] ; not yet , '' was all that she could say .
[male] seized upon the letter , kissed it with transport . and placing it in his bosom , flew to the plantation . no sooner did he perceive from a distance the family . who were awaiting his return upon the rock of adieus than he waved the letter aloft in the air . without being able to utter a word , no sooner was the seal broken .
by a good distribution , not an equal but an equitable distribution must be understood . from these two things combined , the public power without , individual happiness within . results social prosperity , social prosperity means the man happy . the citizen free , the nation great , [female] solves the first of these two problems . she creates wealth admirably , she divides it badly .
leaving the two together under the scrap of vine upon the causeway . [male] idly scattering the leaves from it into the water . and [male] lighting a cigarette , the sisters were paddled away in state as they had come . they had not glided on for many minutes , when little [male] became aware that [male] was more showy in manner than the occasion appeared to require . and , looking about for the cause through the window and through the open door .
mr. [male] had beaten him at litigation . and his own lawyer had advised him that it would be foolish to try the matter further . in his marriage with the noble daughter of the [male] courcys he had allowed the framers of the [male] courcy settlement to tie him up in such a way that now . even when chance had done so much for him in freeing him from his wife . he was still bound to the [male] courcy faction .
but when , well along in the afternoon , a water boy found him up on the weighing floor and told him there was something for him at the office . he made astonishing time getting down , `` here 's your package , '' said [organization] , as bannon burst into the little shanty . it was a little , round , pasteboard box . if bannon had had the office to himself .
he had enriched himself by serving all causes . no man in the world could have been more bourbonist , more bonapartist . more absolutist , more liberal , more atheistical , or more devoutly catholic , he belonged to that great and renowned party which may be called the lucrative party . from time to time he made his appearance in [location] on commercial voyages . and if report spoke truly , he willingly gave a passage to fugitives of any kind .
the whole scene did not last ten minutes , when it was over . the trumpet [male] walked from the doorway where they had been standing . and brushed moisture from his eyes , reaching a dark lumber room . he stood still there to calm himself , and then descended by a flemish ladder to the bakehouse . instead of by the front stairs , he found that the others .
the other man could not be spared from the cattle , and now came the crowning insult of all . it was early morning , after an all night watch along the three miles of fence where the wire cutter always worked . when [male] rode to the top of the ridge where the first breach in his line had been made . below that point , not more than half a mile , he had stopped to boil his breakfast coffee . his first discovery on mounting the ridge was a panel of fence cut .
the thing rankled in her mind night and day . she would wake in the night to repeat her bitter cry . `` oh , why did i burn those notes ? '' it added greatly to the annoyance of the situation that she had twice seen ramage in the avenue since her return to the shelter of her father 's roof . he had saluted her with elaborate civility , his eyes distended with indecipherable meanings . she felt she was bound in honor to tell the whole affair to manning sooner or later .
i know you mean my good , but i do not want to be respectable ! to produce `` human development in its richest diversity '' is to my mind far above respectability . no doubt my tastes are low -- in your view , hopelessly low ! if you won t let me go to him . will you grant me this one request .
it seemed to him the joys of contemplation had never been sounded . he was far from the time when he had found it hard that he should be obliged to give up the idea of distinguishing himself . an idea none the less importunate for being vague and none the less delightful for having had to struggle in the same breast with bursts of inspiring self criticism . his friends at present judged him more cheerful , and attributed it to a theory . over which they shook their heads knowingly , that he would recover his health .
and thus the world outside grew still , and the thick walls of the monastery loomed up against the stars . deep in the midnight , many a choking cry rang fearfully through the stony halls . but came not to the outer air ; and the waning moon shone faintly down upon the enclosure of the garden . where worked a band of silent grave diggers , clad in [male] armour . and with blood red hands , the good country folk .
there is no such word as too late , in the wide world . nay , not in the universe , what , shall we . whose atom of time is but a fragment out of an ever present eternity . shall we , so long as we live , or even at our life 's ending . dare to cry out to the eternal one , `` it is too late , ' '' as [male] spoke .
as he left the castle he gazed at the distant building in the sky and wondered how it had ever been approached in a carriage . she had not told him that allode drove for miles over winding roads that led to the monastery up a gentler slope from the rear . the next afternoon edelweiss thrilled with a new excitement . prince bolaroz of axphain . mad with grief and rage .
soon after the christmas holidays [male] told his mother of his love for sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her . the countess , who had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this declaration . listened to him in silence and then told her son that he might marry whom he pleased . but that neither she nor his father would give their blessing to such a marriage . [male] , for the first time , felt that his mother was displeased with him and that .
i can not tell you , my dear . what a fuss we are in already about it all . [male] wants to have our marriage early in may , so that we may have two months in [location] before [location] is what he calls turned loose . and papa says that there is no use in delaying . because he gets older every day , of course that is true of everybody .
a dismayed half smile flashed over his face . he took a step toward her , and then turned , getting out a cloth he had not used since being alone . near the bed he set the table and laid a plate . knife , fork and spoon . because he was watching peaches he soon discovered she was peeking out at him .
i had moments of horrible belief . of horrible disbelief , but however it might be i knew that she was out of reach for ever . near me -- yes , but only as the silver image of the moon floated in the water by the boat . with the moon herself cold myriads of miles away . i will say no more of that last eclipse of what she had wrought in me .
the editor can not resist the temptation to add that the patriotic lady mentioned in [female] 's note . who `` would rather have seen her son dead on that hearth than hear that he had been a horse 's length behind his companions , '' was his paternal great-grandmother , mrs. [female] . her husband , who died shortly afterwards , so that she was a widow when [female] conversed with her . chanced to be chief magistrate of selkirk , his family was aroused late one night by the sound of a carriage hurrying down the steep and narrow street .
was he falling in love with his wife . or was his way of looking at the girl , of speaking to the girl . only an intelligent piece of acting in the drama ? once or twice madalena tried being cavalier in her manner to [female] . and [female] appeared not to notice ; but afterward the offender was punished . by missing some invitation , this might have been taken as the proof for which she searched .
`` there , you are making me regret already , '' she said with a flash of her old vivacity . [female] flew to the telephone , by a lucky chance elton was calling at grosvenor square . and [male] was able to get them both with one call . he was a little disappointed , however , at not having patricia to himself that evening . `` when shall we get married ? '' [female] asked eagerly , as patricia rose and announced that she must go and repair damages to her face and garments .
`` according to that the honest men are to desert their country in order that the dishonest men may have everything their own way . '' our duke could not answer this , and therefore for the moment he yielded . but he was unhappy , saturnine , and generally silent except when closeted with his ancient mentor . and he knew that he was saturnine and silent , and that it behoved him as a leader of men to be genial and communicative . listening to counsel even if he did not follow it .
`` see here , [male] , '' he replied . i hear what you say , i do not know what you mean by can not if you want to , you say you like me . why can not you come to me ? you are my sort . we will get along beautifully together , you are suited to me temperamentally .
a few days after this mr. [male] was standing at his own gate . watching the building of the chapel and talking to the men . when [male] brattle from the mill came up to him . he would stand there by the hour at a time . and had made quite a friendship with the foreman of the builder from salisbury .
he was impatient for my coming out of my chamber . but finding me long , he went downstairs and talked with my landlord about the parson . when he had said thus he comes upstairs , and i was by that time come out of my room . so he tells me the minister was below . and that he had talked with him , and that upon showing him the license .
[female] took his knife and loosed some of the top coins . which were very tightly packed , till he could move his hand in them freely . then he pulled out handful after handful of every sort of gold coin . there were rose nobles of [male] iv , . sovereigns and angels of [male] vii , and viii , .
and then her mood changed in a flash , nature has decreed that there are certain things in life which shall act as hoops of steel . grappling the souls of the elect together , golf is one of these . a mutual love of horseflesh another ; but the greatest of all is bees , between two beekeepers there can be no strife . not even a tepid hostility can mar their perfect communion , the petty enmities which life raises to be barriers between man and man and between man and woman vanish once it is revealed to them that they are linked by this great bond . envy , malice , hatred , and all uncharitableness disappear .
it was a room that opened straight from the path . and it seemed very full , [female] was sitting there , who was now [female] hadley . her fair placidity admitted no surprise , she smiled and said , `` alison ! '' mrs. [female] stood up in a queer frozen fluster . what do you need , ma'am ? says she , oh , [female] , dear .
she turned then and walked away and as he looked after her she did not glance backward . an erect and regal carriage covered the misery of her retreat . but when she reached her house she went up the stairs like some creature mortally wounded and as she closed the door of her room . there came from her throat a low and agonized groan , she stood leaning for a space against the panels with her hands stretched out gropingly against the woodwork . her lips moved vacantly , then her knees gave way and she crumpled down and lay insensible on the floor .
acknowledging , it is true , that he was no better himself . but arrogating on that ground a correctness of judgment beyond the reach of such as . desiring to be better , were unwilling to believe in the utter badness of anything human . like a lover , he would watch for the appearance of the vile motive . the self interest , that `` must be , '' he knew , at the heart of this or that deed or proceeding of apparent benevolence or generosity .
by the next day 's post the letter to mrs. [female] was sent . and at the appointed time captain [male] arrived . about an hour after he entered the house . [male] went up stairs with a message from him . would miss [female] see him ? miss [male] would see him .
as she turned homeward , nay , entered and seated herself in the salon to await her friends and breakfast . she still wavered as to her immediate departure , or rather she had concluded to tell the [location] simply that she had had a letter from her mamma desiring her return . and to leave it still undecided when she should start , it was already the usual breakfast time . and hearing some one enter as she was leaning back rather tired and hungry with her eyes shut . she rose expecting to see one or other of the [location] -- the words which might determine her lingering at least another day .
the meerschaum and the french novels have been presented to a young templar with whom [male] had been friendly in his bachelor days . and mrs. [female] has a little pension , paid her quarterly , for her care of the canaries and geraniums . i hope no one will take objection to my story because the end of it leaves the good people all happy and at [male] . if my experience of life has not been very long , it has at least been manifold . and i can safely subscribe to that which a mighty king and a great philosopher declared .
the debate on the bill was prolonged during the whole of that week . lord brentford , who loved his seat in the cabinet and the glory of being a minister . better even than he loved his borough , had taken a gloomy estimate when he spoke of twenty seven defaulters . and of the bill as certainly lost , men who were better able than he to make estimates . the bonteens and fitzgibbons on each side of the house .
fitzpiers recognized her as [female] . a hoydenish damsel of the [male] , who was plainly mistaking him for her lover . he was impulsively disposed to profit by her error . and as soon as she began racing away he started in pursuit . on she went under the boughs , now in light .
so far lawless thundered upon them like a preaching friar . but with these words he drew from under his robe a [male] arrow . tossed it on the board in front of the three startled outlaws . turned in the same instant , and , taking [male] along with him . was out of the room and out of sight among the falling snow before they had time to utter a word or move a finger .
before proceeding further , it will be to the purpose to narrate in some detail . a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch . in montfermeil , and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain conjectures of the indictment . as all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences , the second . which at all events , presents some advantages , among others that of possessing a treasure .
always there was the trace of but one rider , who never dismounted to cut even the bottom wire . that it was the work of the same person each time [male] was convinced . for he always rode the same horse , as betrayed by a broken hind hoof . the matter of discovering and punishing the culprit devolved on [male] alone . he could not withdraw [male] to help him .
yes , the timber merchant asserted , he knew that well enough , [male] had been interested in his daughter for years . that was what had led him into the notion of their union . and he knew that she used to have no objection to him . but it was not any difficulty about that which embarrassed him . it was that , since he had educated her so well , and so long .
with that stroke sir mordred fell stark dead to the earth . and the king sank in a swoon upon his body . then sir bedevere and sir lucan , who were both sore wounded and weakly , came up . and between them , with many rests upon the way . took the king to a little combe beside the waters .
it gave him a curiously close sense of her presence to think that at that moment she was living over her enjoyment as intensely as he was living over his unhappiness . his own case was irremediable , but it was easy enough to give her a few more hours of pleasure . and did she not perhaps secretly expect it of him ? after all , if she had been very anxious to join her friends she would have telegraphed them on reaching [location] . instead of writing , he wondered now that he had not been struck at the moment by so artless a device to gain more time .
nay , if she love me not , i care not for her . shall i look pale because the maiden blooms or sigh because she smiles . and smiles on others not i , by heaven ! i hold my [female] too dear , to let it , like the plume upon her cap . shake at each nod that her caprice shall dictate , old play .
they suppose that of course they are all sons of counts or kings . and , to be sure , so they were , and of a very charming age . with graceful and shapely forms , and the clothes they wore were all of the same stuff and cut of the same appearance and colour . there were twelve of them beside their lord . of whom i need tell you no more than that there was none better than he .
[female] her majesty , and put her white face close to the glass as she pinned up her braids . when we went into the drawing room we found [male] . plump and expository , balancing himself on the balls of his feet on the hearth rug and enjoying the caress of the fire on his calves . while [female] , showing against the dark frame of her oak chair like a white rosebud that was still too innocent to bloom . listened with that slight reservation of the attention customary in beautiful women .
it was known to all the world that mrs. [female] 's first great garden party was to come off on wednesday . 16th june , at [location] , mrs. [female] . who lived in grosvenor place and had a country house in gloucestershire . and a place for young men to shoot at in [location] . also kept a suburban elysium at [location] , in order that she might give two garden parties every year .
sickened by insolence so undisguised and unauthorised , and incensed at the triumph of his successful brutality . [male] with pain kept her seat . and with vexation reflected upon the necessity she was under of passing so large a portion of her time in company to which she was so extremely averse . after dinner , when mrs harrel was talking of her party for the evening . of which [male] declined making one , sir [male] .
i told him if those were all his objections i would soon remove them . and convince him that there was not the least room for any difficulty . for that , first , as for suspecting him , if ever i should do it . now is the time to suspect him , and not put the trust into his hands . and whenever i did suspect him , he could but throw it up then and refuse to go any further .
and [female] went out of the parpaillot , followed by [male] . [male] came behind , giving his arm to [male] . [male] mumbled verses to himself . and [male] from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache . in sign of despair , but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to [male] .
there were many things petya wanted to say to the drummer boy . but did not dare to , he stood irresolutely beside him in the passage . then in the darkness he took the boy 's hand and pressed it . when the boy had entered the hut , petya sat down at a distance from him . considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him .
who can not imagine the bitterness of a first suspicion that something in this object of complete love was not quite right ? children demand that their heroes should be fleckless , and easily believe them so . perhaps a first discovery to the contrary is hardly a less revolutionary shock to a passionate child than the threatened downfall of habitual beliefs which makes the world seem to totter for [male] in maturer life . but some time after this renewal of [male] 's agitation it appeared that sir [male] must have been making a merely playful experiment in his question about the singing . he sent for [male] into the library .
i shall hear the prayer your step interrupted ; i shall inhale the incense of the altar . forever i shall feel above our heads the priestly hands that blessed [male] both as you passed by me at the closing benediction . the good abbe marcelin married [male] then ! the happiness , above that of earth , which i feel in this new world of unexpected emotions can only be equalled by the joy of telling it to you . of sending it back to him who poured it into my heart with the lavishness of the sun itself .
when dinner was over , the two men sat smoking and talking of various things . still mostly gardens , aunt eliza had gone to her re-arranged bedroom . whilst [female] could be heard in the kitchen , to which place the poor woman had flown many times in the course of the day as to a harbour of refuge . purposely allowing his pipe to go out , [male] took from his pocket the letter he had written to himself . and tearing off the blank sheet made a spool with which he relit his pipe .
two days later , as quietly as her life had ended , etta 's body . with her baby on its breast , was put into the ground . and mingled with [male] guard 's voice as he read the service for the dead was the far-off murmur of city noises . the soft rise and fall of city sounds . with mrs. [female] and mrs. [female] .
the following morning , before she was up , jan had gone . she was deeply hurt , never before had he left on one of his long trips without spending his last moments with her . she had purposely told her father to entertain the agent and his son at the store that evening . so that jan might have an opportunity of bidding her good by alone . one day , a week after jan had gone .
perhaps , after what i have just said , you will see the necessity of writing me an apology . do so , and i will willingly receive it , i will . afterwards , if your wishes point to a second interview with me . go a step farther , and receive you , my circumstances only enable me to invite you to tea . not that they are at all altered for the worse by what has happened , i have always lived .
now shall ye hear what was the cause that king [male] came into the forest perilous . that was in north wales , by the means of a lady . her name was annowre , and this lady came to king [female] at cardiff . and she by fair promise and fair behests made king [female] to ride with her into that forest perilous . and she was a great sorceress ; and many days she had loved king [female] .
we exchanged little conversation , and he halted at the entrance of thrushcross park . saying , i could make no error there , our adieux were limited to a hasty bow . and then i pushed forward , trusting to my own resources ; for the porter 's lodge is untenanted as yet . the distance from the gate to the grange is two miles . i believe i managed to make it four .
[female] hastened to the sitting room closet to get the platter . she had , in accordance with her promise to mrs. lynde . written to miss [female] of charlottetown , asking for the loan of it . miss [female] was an old friend of [female] 's . and she promptly sent the platter out , with a letter exhorting [female] to be very careful of it .
usually , she sat in miss hathaway 's sewing chair . under a tree a little way from the house . that she might at the same time have a general supervision of her domain . while winfield stretched himself upon the grass at her feet . when the sun was bright , he wore his dark glasses .
bellew strolled along the road , breathing an air fragrant with honey suckle from the hedges . and full of the song of birds ; pausing , now and then , to listen to the blythe carol of a sky lark . or the rich ; sweet notes of a black bird , and feeling that it was indeed . good to be alive ; so that , what with all this , -- the springy turf beneath his feet . and the blue expanse over head , he began to whistle for very joy of it .
for , lo , i stood at the foot of a long pale slide of water . coming smoothly to me , without any break or hindrance . for a hundred yards or more , and fenced on either side with cliff . sheer , and straight , and shining , the water neither ran nor fell , nor leaped with any spouting . but made one even slope of it , as if it had been combed or planed .
with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered [female] 's imagination . for [female] had acknowledged her admiration and preference of [female] before she had ever given her a hint on the subject . but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed , she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments . her influence would have been enough , and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them. . she felt that she had been risking her friend 's happiness on most insufficient grounds .
`` i think i could , '' he answered , and , rising , went for his instrument . which he always brought , and hung on an old nail in the wall the moment he came in . he played a few bars of a prelude . as if to get himself into harmony with the recollection of what he had heard the master play . and then began a lively melody , in which he seemed as usual to pour out his soul .
and a day or so later she heard of the hague convention . she had not known of it before , now she learned of that gentlemen 's agreement among nations . and that it said : `` the use of poison or of poisoned weapons is forbidden . '' she pondered that carefully , trying to think dispassionately , now and then she received a copy of a home newspaper . and she saw that the use of poison gases was being denied by germans in [female] and set down to rumor and hysteria .
the girl lifted over her head the long string of amber beads she had bought in the curiosity shop of jeanne soubise . wrapping it in her handkerchief , she began to tie the silken ends together . [male] was so close to the zaouïa now that they could no longer see him . victoria threw the small but heavy parcel over the wall which hid the dwellers on the roof . where it fell , they could not see , and no sound came up from the sand dune far below .
she clung to him but he broke away . and the room seemed to crash about her ears , she heard the pantry door swing open . a scuffle , the rattle of a tin pan . and in wild despair she rushed into the kitchen and pulled up the gas . her husband 's arm slowly unwound from gedney 's neck .
however , the three mourning coaches were filled according to the written orders of the deceased . there were pall bearers on horseback , with the richest scarfs and hatbands . and even the under bearers had trappings of woe which were of a good well-priced quality . the [female] procession , when dismounted , looked the larger for the smallness of the churchyard . the heavy human faces and the [male] draperies shivering in the wind seemed to tell of a world strangely incongruous with the lightly dropping blossoms and the gleams of [male] on the daisies .
i have said that [female] did her best with what money [female] gave her . but when she came to find that he had not paid the lodging for two months . that the payment of various things he had told her to order and he would see to had been neglected . and that the tradespeople were getting persistent in their applications . that , when she told him anything of the sort .
a twilight calm of happiness then succeeding to their radiant noon . they remained at [female] , until a strange voice in the room startled them both . the room being by that time dark . the voice said , `` do not let the lady be alarmed by my striking a light , '' and immediately a match rattled , and glimmered in a hand , the hand and the match and the voice were then seen by [male] to belong to mr inspector .
then sir gawaine sent the damsel away with the answer that it was now too late for [male] . and so the war went on , sir [male] was never so loath to do battle . but he must needs defend himself ; and when king [male] 's host besieged benwick round about . and fast began to set up ladders , then sir [male] beat them from the walls mightily . all this language heard sir [male] , and he wist well that he must defend himself .
alice , when she came down to the drawing room . before dinner , found mr [organization] there alone , she had dressed more quickly than her friend . and mr [male] had not yet made his appearance . `` i did not expect the pleasure of meeting miss vavasor today , '' he said , as he came up , offering his hand .
the entire surface of the water was practically covered with the floating timbers . a moment 's reflection will show the importance of preserving a full head of water . the moment the stream should drop an inch or so . its surface would contract , the logs would then be drawn close together in the narrow space . and , unless an immediate rise should lift them up and apart from each other .
when she had said in the rapture of passionate confidence that if she possessed [female] 's love there could be no humiliation and no shame . she had not yet dreamt of the creeping degradation of a life in the dark . under a false name , in a false connection : a life under the same roof with [male] . yet not by his side , unacknowledged , unrecognised , hidden and suppressed , even at the moment of that avowal . somewhere in the secret part of her heart , where lay her love of refinement and her desire to be a lady .
this child had not only grown , she had become idealized , as three days in april suffice to cover certain trees with flowers . six months had sufficed to clothe her with beauty , her april had arrived . one sometimes sees people , who , poor and mean , seem to wake up . pass suddenly from indigence to luxury . indulge in expenditures of all sorts .
if the squire required any kind of apology . expression of sorrow , -- and asking for pardon . or such like , he , [male] , would , under the circumstances as they now existed . comply with the requisition most willingly , he would regard it as a simple form . made necessary by his coming marriage , as to [male] 's money .
so i walked on to the end , and a long corridor it was . when i came up to the light , i found that it proceeded from what looked like silver letters upon a door of ebony . and , to my surprise even in the home of wonder itself . the letters formed the words , the chamber of sir anodos . although i had as yet no right to the honours of a knight .
[male] i issues a decree and an army enters [location] . [male] i gives a command and the french submit to the bourbons . experience shows [male] that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it . the historians , in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs . want to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power .
a sound of wrath and grief followed the first cries of triumph among the besiegers . quasimodo , impassive , with both elbows propped on the balustrade , looked on . he had the air of an old , bushy headed king at his window . as for [male] frollo , he was in a critical position . he found himself in the gallery with the formidable bellringer .
she grew paler yet and thinner . dark hollows came about her eyes ; she was parting with life to give it to her child . she lost the girlish gayety [male] used to admire . and the something more lovely that was taking its place he was not capable of seeing . he gave her less and less of his company .
lambert thanked him again for his friendly information . understanding at once his watchful uneasiness and the absence of [male] from the front of the house . he was familiar with that type of man such as wood had described [male] as being . he had met some of them in the bad lands . there was nothing holy to them in the heavens or the earth .
a private room had been prepared for the king and another for [male] . in each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses , the same had been done for the queen and madame the president . the nobles and ladies of their majesties suites were to dress , two by two , in chambers prepared for the purpose . before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived .
they parted in an outer drawing room , where only mr [male] waited on his lady . and dutifully bided his time for shaking hands , when mr [male] was admitted to this closing audience . mr [male] came creeping in with not much more appearance of arms in his sleeves than if he had been the twin brother of miss [female] . and insisted on escorting mr [male] down stairs , all mr [male] 's protestations being in vain . he enjoyed the honour of being accompanied to the hall door by this distinguished man .
it was quite dark before the expected individual came ; but at length he did arrive . and thrusting a note into the hands of the impatient refugee . waited for orders , [male] opened the paper and read in a rough school boy hand . that he , leonard hast , had intended to come to see him off . but that he could not , and that the bearer was a faithful guide .
she in the meantime had left by the train . and reached alfredston road , where she entered the steam tram and was conveyed into the town . it had been her request to phillotson that he should not meet her . she wished , she said , to come to him voluntarily . to his very house and hearthstone , it was friday evening .
he came in a little flushed , but his eyes gleaming , as in answer to the trumpet call of danger . and with a proud look of defiance on his face . that made him a noble , if not a handsome man , [male] had always dreaded lest her courage should fail her in any emergency . and she should be proved to be , what she dreaded lest she was , a coward . but now , in this real great time of reasonable fear and nearness of terror .
it was rather in their setting , their surroundings . the little company of elderly and dowdy persons -- so uniformly clad in weeping blacks and purples that they might have been assembled for some mortuary anniversary . it was in the remoteness and the solidarity of this little group that durham had his first glimpse of the social force of which [male] malrive had spoken . all these amiably chatting visitors , who mostly bore the stamp of personal insignificance on their mildly sloping or aristocratically beaked faces . hung together in a visible closeness of tradition .
[female] 's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute . and her thin face grew [female] in the firelight as she received her father 's praise . feeling that she did deserve a portion of it . `` now , beth , '' said [female] , longing for her turn . but ready to wait , after a minute 's silence , he looked down at [male] .
but what shall be said of the joy of the king and of her who had imagined this thing . instructed of the goddess who is the other half of her lord ? so the procession returned , singing , to chitor with those two in the midst . but among the dogs that fled was allah u din , his face blackened with shame and wrath . the curses choking in his foul throat .
so when they of biaucaire saw their damoiseau . they made great joy of him . for aucassin had dwelt full three years in the castle of torelore . and his father and mother were dead , so the people took him to the castle of biaucaire . and there were they all his men , and he held the land in [female] .
what puzzled me , however , was , that although there were people moving about herding the goats and cattle . i saw no signs of any human habitation . where did they all live ? i wondered , my curiosity was soon destined to be gratified . turning to the left the string of litters followed the cliffy sides of the crater for a distance of about half a mile . or perhaps a little less , and then halted , seeing the old gentleman , my adopted `` father , ''
just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him with a scared look and that princess [female] was no longer by the cot . `` my dear , '' he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him . as often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety , he was seized by an unreasoning panic . it occurred to him that the child was dead . all that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror .
[female] found herself in great request for the dances . and danced more than she had done since the days of her schoolgirl waltzes and polkas in the play room at belforêt . it was about an hour after the dancing had begun . when lady [female] brought her no less a partner than mr. [male] . who had walked a solemn quadrille or two with a stately dowager , and whose request was very surprising to [female] .
the following day was sunday , after breakfast [male] went with the family to church . as was usual ; and there , as usual , he saw [male] in dr thorne 's pew . she , as she looked at him . could not but wonder why he had not answered the letter which was still at [male] . and he endeavoured to read in her face whether it was true .
the lowing of a cow in the quiet meadows . the splash of a trout in the fish pond . the last notes of a tired bird , the creaking of wagon wheels upon the distant road . every now and then breaking the evening silence , only made the stillness of the place seem more intense . it was almost oppressive , this twilight stillness , the very repose of the place grew painful from its intensity .
perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it and entering the house . but the pipe was dilapidated and past service , and hardly hung to its fastenings . moreover , all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars . even the attic windows in the roof , and then , the moon fell full upon that facade . and the man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen [male] in the act of climbing .
the author of the `` five arrows '' was one jyotirisha . he is called the chief ornament of poets . the treasure of the sixty four arts , and the best teacher of the rules of music . he says that he composed the work after reflecting on the aphorisms of love as revealed by the gods . and studying the opinions of gonikaputra , [location] , babhravya .
god is the heart , the soul . the life 's blood of [organization] . it is this room and two or three others . [organization] is our barrier , when strangers come . they see [organization] ; plain rooms .
whether my courage would have held out through the walk from browndown to the rectory . whether i should have shrunk from it when i actually found myself in lucilla 's presence . is more than i can venture to decide , all i say is that i did . in my desperation , positively mean doing it , at the moment when i threatened to do it . and that nugent dubourg heard something in my voice which told him i was in earnest .
that happened which [female] had foreseen , placed between life and death . as [male] was , he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth . and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed . this was all that [male] wanted , he wished [male] a speedy convalescence . took leave of [male] tremouille .
thirdly , that the terms offered to the person who should undertake and properly perform these duties were four guineas a week . that he was to reside at [organization] ; and that he was to be treated there on the footing of a gentleman . fourthly , and lastly , that no person need think of applying for this situation unless he could furnish the most unexceptionable references to character and abilities . the references were to be sent to mr. [male] 's friend in [location] . who was empowered to conclude all necessary arrangements , these instructions were followed by the name and address of [male] 's employer in [location] place .
jill turned pink , mr. [male] . her guide and mentor , foreseeing this situation . had , she remembered , recommended `` pushing the office boy in the face '' : and for a moment she felt like following his advice . prudence , or the fact that he was out of reach behind the brass bars , restrained her .
how many ways does the heart take , how many reasons does it invent for itself . in order to arrive at what it wants , i gazed at her so fixedly that my eyes attracted hers . she looked at me for a few seconds . put up her opera glass to see me better , and seemed to think she recognised me . without being quite sure who i was , for when she put down her glasses .
`` thank god , '' she whispered . for a faint flutter of life had rewarded her investigation . in a bewildered voice she murmured : i must think . i must remember , we were all sitting here -- we were talking , again she called . feebly at first , then with a growing strength , for her husband , and when no answer came except the echo of her own voice .
he felt that now was the moment in which he should tell her of his engagement . but he let the moment pass without using it . and , indeed , it would have been hard for him to tell , in telling such a story he would have been cautioning her that it was useless for her to love him . and this he could not bring himself to do , and he was not sure even now that she had not learned the fact from her sister . `` i hope not , '' he said , in all that he was saying he knew that his words were tame and impotent in comparison with hers .
she looked very lovely in her creamy white satin gown . her small head held regally , the brilliant charm of [female] womanhood radiating from her . she wore no jewels , save one string of perfectly matched pearls . but on pauline [male] 's neck even pearls seemed to sparkle , all these scintillations . flung at [male] , passed over his sleek head and reached [female] where she lingered in the background .
they talked a little longer , but constrainedly , for when the musician found that jude was a poor man his manner changed from what it had been while jude 's appearance and address deceived him as to his position and pursuits . jude stammered out something about his feelings in wishing to congratulate the author on such an exalted composition . and took an embarrassed leave , all the way home by the slow sunday train . sitting in the fireless waiting rooms on this cold spring day . he was depressed enough at his simplicity in taking such a journey .
sepia 's eyes were her great power . she knew the laws of mortar practice in that kind as well as any officer of engineers those of projectiles . there was something about her engines which it were vain to attempt to describe . their lightest glance was a thing not to be trifled with , and their gaze a thing hardly to be withstood . sustained and without hurt defied , it could hardly be by man of woman born .
the prisoner bent his head over his work . setting his white teeth in his lip until his mouth was bitter with the taste of his own blood . the short spring day drew toward its close . the threatened storm marshaled its gray columns down the river . a sighing rain whispered around the building of sorrows .
this fit of crying held me near two hours . and , as i believe , held me till they were all out of the world . and then a most humble , penitent , serious kind of joy succeeded . a real transport it was , or passion of joy and thankfulness . but still unable to give vent to it by words .
for hither had she fled , her cause of flight sir modred . he that like a subtle beast lay couchant with his eyes upon the throne . ready to spring , waiting a chance : for this he chilled the popular praises of the king with silent smiles of slow disparagement . and tampered with the lords of the white horse , heathen , the brood by hengist left . and sought to make disruption in the table round of [male] .
even in this temple of good intentions , an exceptionally sharp boy exceptionally determined to learn . could learn something , and , having learned it , could impart it much better than the teachers . as being more knowing than they , and not at the disadvantage in which they stood towards the shrewder pupils . in this way it had come about that [male] had risen in the jumble . taught in the jumble , and been received from the jumble into a better school .
he finished the contents of his glass . and went softly out of the room , carrying a candle with him . he was absent about ten minutes , and then came back to resume his comfortable seat by the fire . and mixed himself another glass of grog with the air of a man who was likely to finish the bottle . [female] , she cried , half awake and very much .
sally , or rather [female] ( for what young lady of common gentility will reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can ? ) , must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister . it is remarkable , however , that she neither insisted on [female] 's writing by every post . nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance . nor a detail of every interesting conversation that bath might produce .
his evident distress , the unexpected sight , suddenly loosed the fountain of sylvia 's tears . and her sobs grew so terrible that [female] feared she would not be able to remain until the end of the funeral . but she struggled hard to stay till the last , and then she made an effort to go round by the place where kester stood . `` come and see me , '' was all she could say for crying . and kester only nodded his head -- he could not speak a word .
the next morning she set out in the `` hirondelle '' to go to rouen to consult [female] leon . and she stayed there three days , they were three full . exquisite days -- a true honeymoon , they were at the hotel de boulogne . on the harbour ; and they lived there , with drawn blinds and closed doors . with flowers on the floor , and iced syrups were brought them early in the morning .
the next day brought the wished for letter , and the good news that [male] had a fortnight 's leave . and meant to bring [male] home the middle of november . and stay for thanksgiving , after that the natchitoches was to sail for an eighteen months cruise to [location] and [location] . and then [male] would probably have two years ashore at the torpedo station or naval academy or somewhere .
her signal to the dogs was so low he scarcely heard it . and they sped along the white and narrow trail into which [female] had directed them . [female] fell in behind her , it had always roused a certain sense of humour in him to see a woman run . but in [male] he saw now the swiftness and lithesome [female] of a fawn . her head was thrown back , her mittened hands were drawn up to her breast as the forest man runs .
one of those gay and gentle children , who go from land to land affording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers . without stopping his song , the lad halted in his march from time to time . and played at knuckle bones with some coins which he had in his hand . his whole fortune , probably , the child halted beside the [male] . without perceiving [male] , and tossed up his handful of sous , which , up to that time .
`` in this weather ? '' she remonstrated ; and with a sigh he buried his head in his book . then one day may told him that mrs. [female] mingott had asked to see him . there was nothing surprising in the request . for the old lady was steadily recovering , and she had always openly declared that she preferred archer to any of her other grandsons in law . may gave the message with evident pleasure : she was proud of old [female] 's appreciation of her husband .
well -- why should he not be your own ? as for your poor sophie . she would do all in her power to assist the friend whom she love . there is that little girl -- yes ; it is true as i told you . but little girls can not have all they want always , he is a gay deceiver . these men who are so beautiful as [female] are always deceivers .
prince [male] was lying raised high on three pillows . his pale face was calm , his eyes closed , and they could see his regular breathing . `` o , [female] , '' sonya suddenly almost screamed , catching her companion 's arm and stepping back from the door . `` it 's that , that ... '' said sonya , with a white face and trembling lips . [female] softly closed the door and went with sonya to the window .
close by the station there were cattle pens for loading stock . with two long tracks for holding the cars , in autumn fat cattle were driven down out of the hidden valleys to entrain there for market . in those days there was merriment after nightfall in [male] . at other times it was mainly a quiet place . the shooting that was done on its one sided street being of a peaceful nature in the way of expressing a feeling for which some plain witted .
bentley drummle , who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book as if its writer had done him an injury . did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit , heavy in figure . movement , and comprehension , -- in the sluggish complexion of his face . and in the large , awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a room . he was idle , proud , niggardly , reserved , and suspicious , he came of rich people down in somersetshire .
he asked if she were hungry , and she said she was . so was he , now that he came to think of it . nevertheless he let her go in alone , and waited deliberately for several minutes before following . he would have liked to sit by miss [female] at the table . but wished her to see that he did not mean to presume upon any small right of acquaintanceship .
`` to say nothing ... nothing whatever ... '' her strained look threw a haggard light along the pause . as she spoke , the whole odiousness of the scene rushed over him . `` of course i shall say nothing ... you know that ... '' he leaned to her and laid his hand on hers . `` you know i would not for the world ... '' she drew back and hid her face with a sob .
the mother 's heart was breaking , she made no moan . but we saw it in her face . one morning -- it was the morning after [female] 's birthday . which we had made a feint of keeping , with [female] oldtower . the two little grandchildren , [female] and [female] .
we shook hands warmly , and as soon as was decent , i interrupted a flow of reminiscent gratitude by flooding mr. [male] with the story of [male] bey 's unhappy [male] bride . [female] , ill treated as well as cruelly deceived , if her story were true . he knew [female] slightly , but the marriage was news to him . with interest he listened to my account of the lonely little governess in [location] . bewitched by the love making of a handsome turk as white as herself .
the following illustrates to what a degree severity on that point was carried . one day a young girl received a visit from her mother . who was accompanied by a little sister three years of age , the young girl wept . for she wished greatly to embrace her sister , impossible , she begged that . at least , the child might be permitted to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could kiss it .
the passer-by cast a glance around him . saw no one , dared not peer into the [male] niche . and was greatly alarmed , he redoubled his pace , this passer-by had reason to make haste . for a very few instants later , six men , who were marching separately and at some distance from each other . along the wall , and who might have been taken for a gray patrol , entered the rue plumet .
i have a need for him . for i would sell his marriage , but i tell you . in all plainness , if that he continue to weary me . he shall go join his father , i give orders now to change him to the chamber above the chapel . if that ye can swear your innocency with a good , solid oath and an assured countenance .
others , again , while this was in progress , lifted their eyes and swept the vast expanse of country commanded by their position . now lying nearly obliterated by shade , in the valleys of the heath nothing save its own wild face was visible at any time of day . but this spot commanded a horizon enclosing a tract of far extent . and in many cases lying beyond the heath country , none of its features could be seen now . but the whole made itself felt as a vague stretch of remoteness .
he turned back to the window , the thunder had come nearer . it was coming up fast out of the west , and with it a darkness that was like the blackness of a pit . a dead stillness was preceding it now , and in that stillness it seemed to carrigan that he could hear the soapy . slitting sound of the streaming flashes of electrical fire that blazoned the advance of the storm . the camp fires across the river were dying down , one of them went out as he looked at it .
the book of the marriage records was kept in father [female] 's own rooms . locked up and hidden even from his old housekeeper , he had had bitter reason to take this precaution . it had been for more than one man 's interest to cut leaves out of this old record . which dated back to 1769 , and had many pages written full in the hand of father junipero himself . as they came out of the chapel , father [male] leading the way .
the din was on the causeway : a horse was coming . the windings of the lane yet hid it . but it approached , i was just leaving the stile . yet , as the path was narrow , i sat still to let it go by . in those days i was young , and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind .
he did nevertheless feel , poor brute , that after such a day he had earned a little pleasure . and , [male] proceeded to snatch it from fate . despite disapproving glances , punishment , however , fell as soon as it was due . i had stayed behind with the intention of amusing [female] . but [female] took her from me , as if she had bought the right to use my childhood 's friend whenever it suddenly occurred to her to want a chaperon .
we already know how mr. [male] took advantage of her solitude . after that , miss [female] was to accompany the chilterns to [location] . and she was there with them when [female] finn was acquitted . by that time she had brought herself to acknowledge to her friend lady [female] that it would perhaps be desirable that mr. [male] should return . if he did not do so , and that at once , there must come an end to her life in england .
his apparent deafness rendered it a little difficult to make him fully understand that i must see madame [female] . and consign the fruit into her own hands , at last , however , he comprehended the fact that such were my orders . and that duty enjoined their literal fulfilment , addressing the aged bonne . not in french , but in the aboriginal tongue of labassecour , he persuaded her . at last , to let me cross the inhospitable threshold , and himself escorting me up stairs .
the two men might have stumbled over them , waking them up and provoking a request for explanations . for the moment , [male] mifroid 's inquiry saved them from any such unpleasant encounters . the persian and [male] welcomed this incident , which relieved them of inconvenient witnesses . for some of those door shutters , having nothing else to do or nowhere to lay their heads . stayed at the opera , from idleness or necessity .
the chateau of canalis consists of two dismantled towers . united by a piece of wall covered by a fine ivy . and is taxed at twenty two francs , the chanticler of the correze lives in the rue [female] paradis poissoniere . number 29 , which is a highly suitable location for a poet of the angelic school . letters must be post paid , noble dames of the faubourg saint germain are said to take the path to paradise and protect its god .
he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle . he loaded them , looked at the priming . and waited quietly , during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt . and secured his trousers round his waist ; his feet were naked . so he had no shoes and stockings to take off .
but as yet her bodily strength was not sufficient to be an agent to her energetic mind . and the difficulty of driving the ill matched pair of body and will . one weak and languid , the other strong and stern , -- made her ladyship often very irritable . mrs. [female] herself was not quite strong enough for a souffre douleur . and the visit to the towers was not , on the whole .
the bustle which had been observed by [female] maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason . was occasioned by the battle of lens , announced by the prince 's messenger . the duc [male] chatillon . who had taken such a noble part in the engagement ; he was . besides , charged to hang five and twenty flags , taken from the lorraine party .
afterwards she went for a tramp on the moors . and steadied her nerve by the rapid swing of her walk . and the deep inbreathing of that glorious air , once or twice she took a telegram from her pocket . stood still and read it ; then tramped on , to the wonder of the words . `` special license easily obtained , '' ah , the license might be easy to obtain .
there , in her arms , among the flowers and in the sweetness of the sun . he lived again the past , telling her of the days when . knowing his danger , he had held himself aloof . declining to come to her lord 's house with the familiarity of a kinsman . because the pang of seeing her often was too great to bear ; and relating to her also the story of the hours when he had watched her and she had not known his nearness or guessed his pain .
accordingly , after swallowing some food , we started in the litters . feeling , so far as our bodies went , wonderfully like our old selves after our long rest and sleep . i must leave the condition of our minds to the imagination . then came a terrible pull up the cliff , sometimes the ascent was more natural . more often it was a zig zag roadway cut .
fanny did not quite see the thing in this light . and yet she did not wish to contradict him , at this moment she forgot that in order to put herself on perfectly firm ground . she should have gone back to the first hypothesis , and assured him that she did not feel any such regard for him . mr. [male] , whose intellect was more acute . took advantage of her here , and chose to believe that that matter of her affection was now conceded to him .
poor mr. [organization] little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming . and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride. -- could he have seen the heart . he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil . without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either . he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr. [male] .
the elder , lord geraldin . who was to succeed to the title and fortune of glenallan . was totally dependent on his mother during her life , the second , when he came of age . assumed the name and arms of his father . and took possession of his estate , according to the provisions of the countess 's marriage settlement .
he had dismissed the orphans now , and had sent them on to walk with sigismund smith . who kindly related to them the story of `` lilian the deserted , '' with such suppressions and emendations as rendered the romance suitable to their tender years . the philosopher of conventford had got rid of the orphans . and was strolling by himself in those delicious glades , swinging his stick as he went . and throwing up his head every now and then to scent all the freshness of the warm spring air .
he stepped across the papers to shake hands with his client . and then shook hands also with mr ball . whom he knew , his eye glanced at once down to the box . and after that over towards the pale faced clerk , mr ball perceived that the attorney had joined in his own mind the operation that was going on with these special documents . and the presence of these two special visitors ; and that he .
the deemster was observed by everybody , as he passed along the streets there was much whispering and nudging . and some bowing and lifting of hats . he responded to none of it he recognised no one . he , who was famous for courtesy , renowned for gracious manners . beloved for a smile like [male] -- the brighter and more winsome when it broke as from a cloud .
[female] drove slowly under that splendid norman gateway , and [female] looked with a shiver at the portcullis and the great rusty chains high above her head . if it should fall some day upon mr. [male] . as he was riding out of his grand domain , her mind was like a voluminous picture book . full of romantic incidents and dreadful catastrophes ; and she was always imagining such events as these . brown molly jogged slowly along the winding drive , -- oh , the beautiful shrubberies .
even the sad , sour sisters should be kindly dealt with , because they have missed the sweetest part of life . if for no other reason , and looking at them with compassion . not contempt , girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time . that [female] cheeks do not last forever , that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair . and that , by and by , kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now .
i can see her shining in the sky through the little window by my desk . and tonight she seems calling to me again as she has not called before since that long dead night . and i think i can see , across that awful abyss of space . a beautiful black haired woman standing in the garden of a palace . and at her side is a little boy who puts his arm around her as she points into the sky toward the planet earth .
it was on the second day after the surgeon 's funeral . the day following that infinitely more stately ceremonial at mordred church . that mr. [male] came to see [male] , he had been with her several times during the last few days . but he had found all attempts at consolation utterly in vain . and he , who had so carefully studied human nature , knew that it was wisest and kindest to let her alone .
he ponders over this calamity just as if it were the crushing stroke by which a man 's whole career was to be finished forever . i need scarcely say that there is nothing to be gained by reason ing with him . he has worked himself up to a chronic fury . and talks of vengeance all day long . like a corsican , for company here i have an old brother officer of my days of tinsel and pipe clay .
when bannon entered the office , miss vogel handed him a sheet of paper . he came in through the gate and stood at the desk beside her to have the light of the lamp . it was a balance sheet . giving the results of her examination of the books . `` all right , eh ? '' he said , a glance had been enough to show him that hereafter there would be no confusion in the books .
the storm increased with much violence , and threatened to detain the duke a prisoner in his present habitation for the night . the hall , of which he and his people had taken possession . exhibited in every feature marks of ruin and desolation . the marble pavement was in many places broken , the walls were mouldering in decay . and round the high and shattered windows the long grass waved to the lonely gale .
he stopped , and i did not ask him to go on . for i knew that to ask would be useless , yet i guessed what he had meant to say . and why he had stopped , he did not wish to alarm me . but it was in his mind that the house had teen closed because of something planned to happen inside . and that something might be connected with my friends , we should soon know !
the poor girl said not a word as she took into her hand the dreadful document . mrs. [female] asked a question or two of the man . but got from him no information , but it was well known in trotter 's buildings . and round about the three honest men , that [male] brattle was to be tried for the murder of mr. [female] . and public opinion in that part of salisbury was adverse to [female] .
catherine 's disposition was not naturally sedentary , nor had her habits been ever very industrious . but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort , her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased . she could neither sit still nor employ herself for ten minutes together . walking round the garden and orchard again and again , as if nothing but motion was voluntary . and it seemed as if she could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time in the parlour .
one day , when they had parted early and she was returning alone along the boulevard . she saw the walls of her convent . then she sat down on a form in the shade of the elm trees . how calm that time had been , how she longed for the ineffable sentiments of love that she had tried to figure to herself out of books ! the first month of her marriage , her rides in the wood .
the faubourg saint antoine had also other causes to tremble ; for it received the counter shock of commercial crises . of failures , strikes , slack seasons . all inherent to great political disturbances , in times of revolution misery is both cause and effect . the blow which it deals rebounds upon it . this population full of proud virtue , capable to the highest degree of latent heat .
a beautiful series of young people 's books to suit the tastes of the most fastidious . the publishers consider themselves fortunate in being able to offer such a marvelous line of choice subjects . made up into attractive presentation volumes , large type . fine heavy paper , numerous pictures in [male] . inserted with six lithographic reproductions in ten colors by eminent artists .
canalis and [female] went into the salon on a sign that passed between them . `` i went out this morning to see the men fish , [female] , '' said the valet , -- an excursion proposed to me by the captain of a smack . whose acquaintance i have made , [male] did not acknowledge that he had the bad taste to play billiards in a cafe . a fact of which butscha had taken advantage to surround him with friends of his own and manage him as he pleased .
that further letter must be one which must make all amicable intercourse between him and the bishop impossible . and it must be so written as to be fit to meet the public eye if he should be ever driven by the bishop 's conduct to put it in print . a great wrong had been done him ; -- a great wrong , the bishop had been induced by influences which should have had no power over him to use his episcopal rod and to smite him . him [male] wortle ! he would certainly show the bishop that he should have considered beforehand whom he was about to smite , `` 'amo ''
and moving aside , he switched on the strong electric lights , the class room was distinct and hard . a strange place after the soft dim magic that filled it before he came . [female] turned curiously to look at ursula , her eyes were round and wondering . bewildered , her mouth quivered slightly , she looked like one who is suddenly wakened . there was a living , tender beauty .
this good effect was assisted by many curious little treasures of art . which the host had taken care to strew upon his tables . they were principally such bits of antiquity as the soil of [male] and its neighborhood are still rich in . seals , gems , small figures of bronze . mediaeval carvings in ivory ; things which had been obtained at little cost .
`` good boy , i am glad he 's gone , '' said [male] , with an approving smile , the next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room . adding , with an involuntary sigh , `` yes , i am glad , but how i shall miss him . '' when the first bitterness was over , the family accepted the inevitable , and tried to bear it cheerfully . helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of trouble .
she whispered soft in the little one 's ear as she took her upstairs to bed . about three weeks after the miserable date of [organization] death and [male] 's disappearance . [male] rose received a letter from him . she knew the writing on the address well . and it made her tremble so much that it was many minutes before she dared to open it .
if she could only leave him to his career . and save her own situation also , but at that moment the proposition seemed as impossible as to construct a triangle of two straight lines . the new consideration which at present occupied her mind was whether she could have the courage to leave swithin to himself . as in the original plan , and singly meet her impending trial , despising the shame . till he should return at five and twenty and claim her ? yet was this assumption of his return so very safe ?
this side of the situation had not struck [male] at first . he got up and walked the floor , while the girl . standing quietly by the fireplace , watched him , a proud . fond light in her eyes . sammy did not know what the bond between her father and the big ruffian was .
but she knew that future by heart already , she had not spent her life among the rich and fashionable without having learned every detail of the trappings of a rich and fashionable marriage . she had calculated long ago just how many dinner dresses , how many tea gowns and how much lacy lingerie would go to make up the outfit of the future countess of altringham . she had even decided to which dressmaker she would go for her chinchilla cloak for she meant to have one . and down to her feet , and softer and more voluminous and more extravagantly sumptuous than violet 's or ursula 's ... not to speak of silver foxes and sables ...
many long and heavily laden grain trains were in front of them . and they could feel the hand of jimmy hawkins from far off . they waited in extemporised sidings while processions of empty trucks returned to the north . and were coupled on to slow , crawling trains , and dropped at midnight , heaven knew where . but it was furiously hot , and they walked to and fro among sacks .
`` and eagles have claws , '' said the duke . not relinquishing his hold on the banner staff , yet hesitating to pull it from the ground . the speaker of sentences , notwithstanding such was his occupation . had nevertheless some intervals of sound sense , he clashed his staff loudly . and [male] , as if by habit , turned his head towards his man of counsel .
yet he knew well that he waked in some supernatural sphere . for his eyes could see across the river as if the opposite shore lay at his feet . and he could distinguish every leaf on every tree . and the flowers moon blanched and ghost like , and there , in the blackest shade of the pippala boughs . he beheld a faint light like a pearl .
this sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the champs elysees . difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a bad preservative of the subterranean constructions . on account of its excessive fluidity , this fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of the sands of the quartier saint georges . which could only be conquered by a stone construction on a concrete foundation . and the clayey strata , infected with gas .
vesta rode out to meet them as they were coming back . to make sure of her thanks , she was radiant with gratitude . and at no loss any longer for words to express it . before they had ridden together on the return journey half a mile . [male] felt that he had known her all her life .
it also resembled some monster candelabra all along which sparkled drops of diamonds running together . the soft night was about them ; masses of shadow filled the branches . emma , her eyes half closed . breathed in with deep sighs the fresh wind that was blowing , they did not speak . lost as they were in the rush of their reverie .
a quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began . during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult ; for that space of time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely . and they used their privilege , the whole conversation ran on the breakfast . which one and all abused roundly , poor things , it was the sole consolation they had . [female] was now the only teacher in the room .
clarissa consented to accept the use of the money . she would be able to repay it , of course . she had a vague idea that she could earn money as a teacher of drawing in some remote continental city . where they might live very cheaply , how sweet it would be to work for her child ! much sweeter than to be a millionaire 's wife and dress him in purple and fine linen that cost her nothing .
knowing my [female] 's innocence , i felt the insult shown her in my heart of hearts . and might in the heat of the moment have been betrayed into an unwise utterance of my indignation . if at that moment i had not encountered the eye of mr. [male] . fixed on me from the rear hall . in the mingled surprise and distress he displayed .
by her side a little river glided out from underground with a soft dark babble . unawares of daylight ; then growing brighter . lapsed away , and fell into the valley , then , as it ran down the meadow . alders stood on either marge , and grass was blading out upon it . and yellow tufts of rushes gathered , looking at the hurry .
`` about tomorrow noon , '' replied the captain , moving away . thorpe followed him a short distance . discussing the landing , the cripple stood all night . his bright , luminous eyes gazing clear and unwinking at the moonlight . listening to his heart song of the sea .
such and so licentious were the times , as announced by the public declaration of the assembled clergy . recorded by eadmer ; and we need add nothing more to vindicate the probability of the scenes which we have detailed . and are about to detail , upon the more apocryphal authority of the wardour ms . while the scenes we have described were passing in other parts of the castle . the jewess [female] awaited her fate in a distant and sequestered turret .
what had perhaps brought on just now a kind of climax was the fact of her appearing to make out . through aunt maud , what was really the matter . it could not be less than a climax for a poor shaky maiden to find it put to her of a sudden that she herself was the matter . for that was positively what , on mrs. lowder 's part . it came to , everything was great , of course .
i heard her , but i could say nothing . her last words had killed the little hope that still lived in me . i had caught her in my arms , and the sting and torment of my remorse had closed them round her like a vice , yes , my remorse . the white despair of walter 's face . when my cruel words struck him to the heart in the summer house at limmeridge .
perhaps mr. [male] had been in communication with someone else more suitable than she . and had thrown over the appointment without troubling to let her know , or perhaps he had been waiting in the foyer . had inspected her as she passed , and had not liked her looks . this latter supposition seemed probable ; but the head waiter was so confident of what she ought to do that the girl could think of no excuse . after all , it would do little harm to wait and `` see what happened . ''
grandcourt had intense satisfaction in leading his wife captive after this fashion . it gave their life on a small scale a royal representation and publicity in which every thing familiar was got rid of . and every body must do what was expected of them whatever might be their private protest . the protest adding to the piquancy of despotism . to [female] , who even in the freedom of her maiden time .
under miss west 's instructions bunks . drawers , shelves , and all superficial woodwork have been ripped out . she worked the carpenter from daylight till dark . and then , after a night of fumigation , two of the sailors . with turpentine and white lead , put the finishing touches on the cleansing operations .
`` all right , '' said he ; then he kissed her forehead and escaped from her . and went his way , telling himself ; as he went . that she was a fool , that was the last he saw of her . before his yachting commenced ; but she -- poor fool . was up by times in the morning , and , peeping out between her curtains as the early summer sun glanced upon her eyelids .
he took me at my word immediately . and after that there was no resisting him ; neither indeed had i any mind to resist him any more . let what would come of it , thus the government of our virtue was broken . and i exchanged the place of friend for that unmusical , harsh sounding title of whore . in the morning we were both at our penitentials .
this was an old world she was still journeying through , winter heavy and dreary , there was plough land and pasture . and copses of bare trees . copses of bushes , and homesteads naked and work bare . no new earth had come to pass , she looked at birkin 's face . it was white and still and eternal , too eternal , she linked her fingers imploringly in his .
sakr el bahr paid little heed to him . lying there he looked down the slope , clad with stunted cork trees and evergreen oaks . here and there was the golden gleam of broom ; yonder over a spur of whitish rock sprawled the green and living scarlet of a cactus . below him about the caves of [male] was a space of sea whose clear depths shifted with its slow movement from the deep green of emerald to all the colours of the opal . a little farther off behind a projecting screen of rock that formed a little haven two enormous masted galleys .
page yes , sir , [male] is mr. [male] there ? page he 's in the tent . sir -- refreshing , [male] ask him to be so good as to step this way . page yes , sir , aline oh , but , [male] , a real sorcerer ! oh , i shall be frightened to death , [female] i trust my aline will not yield to fear while the strong right arm of her [female] is here to protect her .
then , in the early spring of 187 -- , they came back to england . having persistently carried out their project , at any rate in regard to time . lord [male] , the younger son . was at once sent up to trinity , for the eldest son a seat was to be found in [organization] . and the fact that a dissolution of parliament was expected served to prevent any prolonged sojourn abroad .
at the sight of such a woman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him that his breath failed him . and tears came into his eyes , and he was on the tiptoe of expectation that she would come up to him . would lift her veil , all her face would be visible , she would smile . she would hug him , he would sniff her fragrance . feel the softness of her arms , and cry with happiness .
suddenly his strange , strained attention gave way . he could not attend to these mysteries any more , there was another way . the way of freedom , there was the paradisal entry into pure . single being , the individual soul taking precedence over love and desire for union . stronger than any pangs of emotion , a lovely state of free proud singleness .
in the care of her son , and the control of the fortune to which he would later succeed . mrs. [female] , who was blessed with an equal vocation for motherhood and finance . became happily absorbed , everything promised well , the business in gloucester realised more than she could have expected . and she settled down in the placid surroundings of overton with no care in the world but [male] 's future . he was a singularly beautiful child , fair haired , with a skin that even in manhood was dazzlingly white .
well , the risk must be taken ; there was no escape from it now . even as these disquieting imaginings chased themselves through his mind . the car stopped before the door and [male] galbraith . who had come to meet the guests , entered at the gate , no courtesy that would add to their comfort had been omitted . there were rugs and extra wraps , and a drive along the shore road had been planned as an added pleasure .
the whirlwind of excitement passed over , leaving no trace to mark its passage . save a fixed calm expression , which a more violent demonstration of feeling would not have done . the week following the receipt of [male] 's letter mr. [male] had business which took him to frankfort . [male] accompanied him and remained several days . the morning after her arrival she and mr. [female] were walking upon the upper balcony at mrs. [female] 's .
his task sounded simple , but it was not easy ; for he did not know where rischenheim was . and so could not prevent his coming ; besides , the king had been very pleased to learn of the count 's approaching visit . since he desired to talk with him on the subject of a certain breed of dogs . which the count bred with great , his majesty with only indifferent success . therefore he had declared that nothing should interfere with his reception of rischenheim .
that night , when the boys were called to supper , they sat down moodily . they had worn their coats to town . but they ate in their striped shirts and suspenders . they were grown men now , and , as alexandra said . for the last few years they had been growing more and more like themselves .
we received unstinted praise from our employers for bringing to a successful conclusion the errand on which we were sent under such trying circumstances . but now that we were where grub was plentiful we looked on our experience as nothing to make a fuss over . but we deeply regretted the loss of our cook and mess wagon . and we resolved that if we ever found the guilty parties to make it rather warm for them . this we never did , neither did we ever hear more of the fate of the cook .
the next moment the vision of coral 's hopeless suitor had faded . and [male] was once more spinning around on the wheel of his own woes . the night before , when he had sent his note to susy . from a little restaurant close to palazzo vanderlyn that they often patronized . he had done so with the firm intention of going away for a day or two in order to collect his wits and think over the situation .
he loitered , on the best of the relenting days . the several occasions we speak of , along the part of the gardens nearest to lancaster gate . and when , always , in due time , [female] croy came out of her aunt 's house . crossed the road and arrived by the nearest entrance , there was a general publicity in the proceeding which made it slightly anomalous . if their meeting was to be bold and free it might have taken place within doors .
the note which had been surreptitiously passed to him in ganlook lay crumpled and forgotten inside his coat pocket . where he had dropped it the moment it had come into his possession . supposing that the message contained information which had been forgotten by [organization] . and was by no means of a nature to demand immediate attention . had he read it at once his suspicions would have been confirmed .
he almost blushed as he put this question . but mr. [organization] 's scouted idea recurred to him . and the words were out of his mouth before he well knew what he was about . [male] did not answer immediately ; but by the bent drooping of her head . he guessed what her reply would be , yes ; i believe -- oh papa .
[female] out his arms , he grabbed wildly . while a force , seemingly gentle but irresistible , sucked him lower and lower , and with each inch it bore him down . gripped tighter , and pulled faster , when he glanced at the boys he saw panic in their faces . and he realized that he was probably lost , and they were terror stricken . the first gulp of tepid shore water that strangled him in running across his gasping lips made him think of peaches .
having learned not to expect any response to remarks not absolutely demanding one , and not wishing the silence to dominate . [male] talked on , as he led frale into the cabin and carefully closed the door behind them . thryng 's intuition was subtle and his nature intense and strong . he had been used to dealing with men , and knew that when he wished to . he usually gained his point , feeling the antagonism in frale 's heart toward himself .
each time leon had to tell her everything that he had done since their last meeting . she asked him for some verses . some verses `` for herself , '' a `` love poem '' in honour of her , but he never succeeded in getting a rhyme for the second verse . and at last ended by copying a sonnet in a `` keepsake , '' this was less from vanity than from the one desire of pleasing her .
then , one night at dinner , a telegram was brought in . and she knew it was the expected word . she felt her mother 's eyes on her . and she sat very still with her hands clenched in her lap . but her father did not read it at the table .
pierre dobree was ordinarily a calm , rather [female] . cheerful , high dried old frenchman , quite small and thin , and with a very perceptible stoop . but [male] said afterwards that there was a very terrible look in his face just then . such a look as may have been born , perhaps , in the days of terror . when he stood in the crowd beneath the guillotine and saw the head of [location] dufarge fall into the sack .
in short , he made himself as safe as a forsyte in his condition could . under the rose of his mild irony , secure from discovery . since his wife and son had gone up to town . he had spent the fine may day quietly arranging his papers . that he might die tomorrow without inconveniencing any one , giving in fact a final polish to his terrestrial state .
now she did not dress for her own sake . not for the sake of her own beauty , but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creatures she might not spoil the general effect . and looking at herself for the last time in the looking glass she was satisfied with herself . she looked nice , not nice as she would have wished to look nice in old days at a ball . but nice for the object which she now had in view .
indeed , indeed it shall be taken in good part , said [female] , indeed it shall , and she swore a solemn silent vow of friendship for the dear old woman . then there came letters and telegrams from chambery . dijon , and [location] , and the joint expedition in search of the cottage was made to [female] . it was astonishing how enthusiastic and how loving the elder and the younger lady were together before the party from [location] had arrived in [location] .
[male] , not knowing the significance of these symptoms . interpreted this new nervous susceptibility into a means of alarming [male] into true confessions . and taxed him with falsehood in saying that he had not told anything . since he had just told the man who took him up in his gig and brought him to stone court . [male] denied this with solemn adjurations ; the fact being that the links of consciousness were interrupted in him .
whether this excellence were the result of practice and instruction . or a sudden emanation of general genius , accidentally directed to a particular point . was disputed by the critics amongst the audience ; and disputed , as usual , with the greater vehemence . from the impossibility of obtaining documents to decide , or direct opinion . but that which was regarded as the highest refinement of her acting , was a certain air of inquietude .
this final detail having been attended to , mr. [male] promptly proceeded to forget business and launched forth into a recital of his manifold adventures since leaving [location] . and when at length all of their classmates had been accounted for and listed as dead . married , prosperous , or pauperized , the amiable and highly entertaining buck took his departure with the announcement that he would look around a little and try to buy some good second hand grading equipment and a locomotive . in addition to casting an eye over the labour situation and sending a few wires east for the purpose of sounding the market on steel rails . always an enthusiast in all things , in his mind 's eye mr. [male] could already see a long trainload of logs coming down the northern [location] and [location] railroad .
she was lying upon the floor , upon the very spot in which she had crouched at her husband 's feet telling her guilty story . whether she was in a swoon , or whether she lay there in the utter helplessness of her misery . [male] scarcely cared to know , he went out into the vestibule . and sent one of the servants to look for her maid , the smart . be ribboned damsel who was loud in wonder and consternation at the sight of her [male] .
mckay tapped again , very lightly , and the door closed quickly behind the girl . in a moment she was at the window . which was raised a little from the bottom , `` yes , '' he said . finding a little hand in the darkness , `` it 's me . '' the hand was cold , and its fingers clung tightly to his , as if the girl was frightened .
but this he seemed not to mind , and , having room for extension in the open air . he lifted her against his shoulder . so that he could carry her with ease . the absence of clothes taking much from his burden . thus he bore her off the premises in the direction of the river a few yards distant .
he was good humoured and tractable , and docile enough when nothing disagreeable was asked from him . he would have , he said , no objection to live at [male] abbey if [male] liked it . he did not believe much in farming , but would consent at [male] 's request to be the owner of bullocks . he was quite ready to give up hunting , having already taught himself to think that the very few good runs in a season were hardly worth the trouble of getting up before daylight all the winter . he went forth , therefore , on his embassy , and we know how he failed .
he learned that an intimacy had for some time subsisted between maria and the cavalier [male] . and that the assignation was usually held at the pavilion on the sea shore . in an evening , baptista farther declared , that if the marquis desired a confirmation of his words . he might obtain it by visiting this spot at the hour mentioned . this information lighted up the wildest passions of his nature .
even as [male] shut the gate he heard the sound of horses hoofs down by the porter 's lodge , the justices were coming . the two whose names he had heard with amazement last week . as the last corroboration of the incredible rumour of his master 's defection . for these were a couple of magistrates -- harmless men .
all that day king mark was sore and ill of mind and haggard of face . and could never stay still , but was for ever faring with his barons to where he could look down upon the ship of sir marhaus . and see the knight waiting in his armour , late in the afternoon . as the king stood thus , gnawing his nails for rage . and so hot and wrathful that none of his barons dare speak to him .
this was the lad who had first recognized [female] ; and when she now . as the turk , replied with suitable defiance , and at once began the combat . the young fellow took especial care to use his sword as gently as possible . being wounded , the knight fell upon one knee , according to the direction . the doctor now entered , restored the knight by giving him a draught from the bottle which he carried .
she said her only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow . that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief . that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone . and that he , from above , saw her affection and gratitude . the princess heard her , not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her voice .
[male] bramble still hesitated as to revealing his relationship to captain [male] . from real feelings of delicacy , even to mrs. [female] . whom he felt he could trust , partly because he had reason to know that the mother had favored the suit of his brother whom [male] had rejected in [location] . and partly because at present of his own equivocal situation , but to [female] herself he felt that he might . indeed that he must reveal the important truth , and that very evening as they sat together in one of the spacious apartments of the mission house .
if anyone had mentioned this astonishing fact , nobody would have believed it . nevertheless , it was quite true , and sober , businesslike [male] suddenly discovered a fund of romance at the bottom of his hitherto well conducted heart that amazed him . he was not quite clear what had happened to him at first , and sat about in a dazed sort of way . seeing , hearing , knowing nothing but [male] . while the unconscious idol found something wanting in the cordial praise so modestly received because mr. [male] never said a word .
when three or four weeks had been passed thus , yeobright resumed his reading in earnest . to make up for lost time he studied indefatigably , for he wished to enter his new profession with the least possible delay . now , [female] 's dream had always been that , once married to clym , she would have the power of inducing him to return to [location] . he had carefully withheld all promise to do so ; but would he be proof against her coaxing and argument ? she had calculated to such a degree on the probability of success that she had represented [location] .
here were no ill fed , whiskey poisoned men , such as the rest of the sailors . who , having drunk up their last pay days , had starved ashore until they had received and drunk up their advance money for the present voyage . these three , on the other hand were supple and vigorous , their movements were spontaneously quick and accurate . perhaps it was the way they looked at me . with incurious yet calculating eyes that nothing escaped , they seemed so worldly wise .
if she had shared considine 's interest in his profession things might have been different . no doubt she would have thrown herself into it with enthusiasm . but her enthusiasm was of a very different nature from the steady flame that burned in considine . no doubt he knew this , and felt that her sharing would be disturbing by its violence . in the ordinary course of events i suppose he expected that she would have another child .
phineas laughed as he read the article , and declared to himself that the joke was a good joke . but , nevertheless , he suffered , mr. [male] . when he was really anxious to use his thong earnestly , could generally raise a wale . on the 10th of august , [male] finn did return to loughton . he went down by the mail train on the night of the 10th .
this is quite far enough to imbue me with great respect for the martian firearm . and some telepathic force must have warned me against an attempt to escape in broad daylight from under the muzzles of twenty of these death dealing machines . the martians , after conversing for a short time , turned and rode away in the direction from which they had come . leaving one of their number alone by the enclosure , when they had covered perhaps two hundred yards they halted . and turning their mounts toward [male] sat watching the warrior by the enclosure .
`` who is ? '' asked [male] , looking calmly at his questioner . and the red fox lapsed into baffled silence , the moon was brilliant and the night was still . suddenly the red fox cocked his ear like a hound . and without a word slipped swiftly within the cabin , a moment later [male] heard the galloping of a horse and from out the dark woods loped a horseman with a winchester across his saddle bow . he pulled in at the gate , but before he could shout `` hello '' the red fox had stepped from the porch into the moonlight and was going to meet him .
thus he detached the cable which kept suspended and also fast to the basement of the little douvre the end of the forward side of the durande . fashioned out of some ends of hawsers a sort of hinges . holding this bulwark to the huge nails fixed in the granite . swung this apparatus of planks upon them . like the gates of a great dock , and turned their sides .
lester [male] was past the youthful love period . and he knew it , the innocence and unsophistication of younger ideals had gone . he wanted the comfort of feminine companionship . but he was more and more disinclined to give up his personal liberty in order to obtain it . he would not wear the social shackles if it were possible to satisfy the needs of his heart and nature and still remain free and unfettered .
for a little more than a fortnight [male] arundel visited his betrothed daily in the shabby first floor in oakley street . and sat by her side while she worked at some fragile scrap of embroidery . and talked gaily to her of the happy future ; to the intense admiration of mrs. pimpernel . who had no greater delight than to assist in the pretty little sentimental drama that was being enacted on her first floor . it was rather a dreary wedding , no doubt .
but she was not prepared for the changed jan thoreau who came slowly through the cabin door . his hair and beard had grown , covering the smooth cheeks which he had always kept closely shaven . his eyes glowed with dull pleasure as she stood waiting for him . but there was none of the old flash and fire in them . there was a strangeness in his manner , an uneasiness in the shifting of his eyes .
lord elmwood was by nature . and more from education , of a serious , thinking , and philosophic turn of mind . his religious studies had completely taught him to consider this world but as a passage to another . to enjoy with gratitude what heaven in its bounty should bestow , and to bear with submission . whatever in its vengeance it might inflict , in a greater degree than most people he practised this doctrine .
madame [female] looked for her orders again . got them again , said she would prefer leaving [female] to our business . and resolutely walked out , the count lit a cigarette , went back to the flowers in the window . and puffed little jets of smoke at the leaves . in a state of the deepest anxiety about killing the insects .
she could see draycott [male] exchanging glances with his mother and then being conscientiously charitable to her . but then perhaps by tomorrow mrs. [female] would have heard the news . would send round an icy little note requesting that she fail to appear . and behind her back they would all laugh and know that marjorie had made a fool of her . that her chance at beauty had been sacrificed to the jealous whim of a selfish girl .
peter had grown restless again , and a little more suspicious of breault , he was not afraid of him . but all that day he had found no scent of nada or jolly [male] . and slowly the conviction was impinging itself upon him that he should seek for himself in the wilderness . for an hour he kept watch over the plain through his binoculars . seeking for a wisp of smoke that might rise at any time over the treetops .
surely it was more than a mere hope that made my heart beat so wildly ! how could a sensation so strangely sudden , so irresistible in its power , possess me unless she were living and near ? can it be , can it be that we shall meet again ? to look again into your divine eyes -- to hold you again in my arms at last ! i so changed -- so different , but the old love remains ; and of all that has happened in your absence i shall tell you nothing .
king [male] ( we are not told which among the monarchs of that name . but , from his temper and habits , we may suppose [male] iv . ) sets forth with his court to a gallant hunting match in sherwood forest . in which , as is not unusual for princes in romance , he falls in with a deer of extraordinary size and swiftness . and pursues it closely , till he has outstripped his whole retinue .
they followed him into the house and upstairs to its flat roof . from this point of vantage they saw that the house was built with an interior courtyard or patio . looking down into this courtyard from the roof they could see a little . splashing fountain in its center , with flower beds . a narrow gray path , and several small white benches , the roof .
its voices whispered at his ear , its face peered into his eyes . but the hot winds came up and danced round him . the air , the sea , the sky . the whole world , the utter universe seemed afire . his eyes rolled upwards to his brow .
`` baldos , '' said [male] , from the top step . it has come to our ears that you left the castle surreptitiously last night . is it true that you were aided by miss calhoun ? baldos looked thankful for this eminently leading question , in a flash it gave him the key to the situation . secretly he was wondering what emotions possessed the slender accomplice who had said good-bye to him not so many hours before at the castle gate .
two whole years and a half passed thus , sometimes he might have been found shaping the mullions of a country mansion . sometimes setting the parapet of a town hall , sometimes ashlaring an hotel at sandbourne . sometimes a museum at casterbridge , sometimes as far down as exonbury . sometimes at stoke barehills , later still he was at kennetbridge . a thriving town not more than a dozen miles south of marygreen .
wherefore [male] learned to loathe his god as intensely as he loathed mrs. [female] . and this is not a wholesome frame of mind for the young , since she chose to regard him as a hopeless liar . but an economical and self contained one , never throwing away the least unnecessary fib , and never hesitating at the blackest . were it only plausible , that might make his life a little easier , the treatment taught him at least the power of living alone . a power that was of service to him when he went to a public school and the boys laughed at his clothes .
nevertheless , he found himself clinging to the hope of some reply as to his one last chance of redemption . he waited day after day . saying that it was perfectly absurd to expect , yet expecting , while he waited he was suddenly stirred by news about phillotson . phillotson was giving up the school near christminster . for a larger one further south , in mid wessex , what this meant .
he now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life . with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free . and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment . the sick man was given something to drink , there was a stir around him . then the people resumed their places and the service continued .
certain strange habits : arriving at the hour when other people are taking their leave . keeping in the background when other people are displaying themselves . preserving on all occasions what may be designated as the wall colored mantle , seeking the solitary walk . preferring the deserted street , avoiding any share in conversation . avoiding crowds and festivals , seeming at one 's ease and living poorly .
worries attended such possessions , worries of every kind . crowned by bills , in the sober gloom of prince of wales terrace she could obscurely enjoy inexpensive yet real comfort . without being snatched at by predatory men servants or collectors for charities . and a taxi stand was at the end of the road . her annual outlay was small , the house was inherited , death had furnished it for her .
fernand made no reply , nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of mercedes . although for each of these tears he would have shed his heart 's blood . but these tears flowed for another , he arose , paced a while up and down the hut . and then , suddenly stopping before mercedes , with his eyes glowing and his hands clinched , say , mercedes , he said , once for all , is this your final determination ?
accordingly , mr. [male] `` walked in where the pile of saddles were , '' and knocked at a side door , it was opened by a very handsome young girl . who politely asked the stranger to enter , he did so and found within a mild looking . middle-aged lady , whose dark eyes and hair showed her at once to be the mother of the young lady who had opened the door for him . mrs. [female] , for she it was .
my dear mr. [male] , did not you hear me ? did you know that netherfield park is let at last ? my dear mr. [male] , how can you be so tiresome ! you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them , design ! , nonsense ! how can you talk so ? but it is very likely that he will fall in love with one of them .
at times , during this same stage of his toilet . they might have had even more entertainment : -- before putting on his socks noble `` one stepped '' for several minutes . still retaining upon his head the new hat , this was a hat of double value to him . not only was it [male] to behold in his mirror . but it was engaged in solidifying for the evening the arrangement of his hair .
mr. [male] had a cheerful manner , which always did him good . and his many inquiries after `` poor [female] '' and her children were answered most satisfactorily . when this was over , mr. [male] gratefully observed , it is very kind of you . mr. [male] , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk .
her interest in the commonplace and unromantic irritated him . but an instinct of good manners , that was not the least of his charm . compelled him to humour her , once she sat for a whole hour in a dark cellar that smelt of tallow where a couple of men were engaged in making those enormous candles that people in [location] light on christmas day . and once radway was forced to follow her into the forecastle of a breton schooner reeking of garlic . where she practised the french that considine had taught her .
the clerk declared he would not fail to do so , being obliged , moreover , to go to yonville on some business for his office . and they parted before the saint herbland passage just as the clock in the cathedral struck half past eleven . often when he stayed in his room to read , or else when sitting of an evening under the lime trees of the [location] . he let his code fall to the ground . and the memory of emma came back to him .
i have so often wandered through those gloomy passages without finding a sign of humanity there . without hearing any slightest tick of the hammer of labour . that i am disposed to think that lord chancellors have been anxious to save their subordinates from suicide . and have mercifully decreed that the whole staff of labourers , down to the very message boys of the office . should be sent away to green fields or palatial clubs during , at any rate .
for the hair was quite as bright and golden as the thread of gold itself . the queen takes the shirt and presents it to [male] . ah , god , what joy would [male] have felt had he known what the queen was giving him ! and how glad would she , too , have been , who had inserted her own hair . if she had known that her lover was to own and wear it !
there was no wind , as he crossed the dam prince [male] smelled the ooze and freshness of the pond . he longed to get into that water , however dirty it might be . and he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter . the small , muddy , [male] had risen visibly more than a foot , flooding the dam . because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick red hands .
nor was this all , suddenly i saw one great fellow seize a flaming human arm that had fallen from its parent frame . and rush off into the darkness , presently he stopped , and a tall streak of fire shot up into the air . illumining the gloom , and also the lamp from which it sprang . that lamp was the mummy of a woman tied to a stout stake let into the rock . and he had fired her hair , on he went a few paces and touched a second .
the village of weatherbury was quiet as the graveyard in its midst . and the living were lying well nigh as still as the dead , the church clock struck eleven . the air was so empty of other sounds that the whirr of the clock work immediately before the strokes was distinct . and so was also the click of the same at their close , the notes flew forth with the usual blind obtuseness of inanimate things . flapping and rebounding among walls , undulating against the scattered clouds , spreading through their interstices into unexplored miles of space .
when he began to reflect , he could not quite recollect what it was that lord [male] had said to him . he did remember that something had been suggested about a brother and sister which had implied that [male] might want protection . but there was nothing unnatural or other than kind in the position which lord [male] had declared that he would assume . `` he seemed to think that i was not treating you well , '' said he , turning round from the breakfast table to the fire .
the story of the deaths of eustacia and wildeve was told throughout egdon . and far beyond , for many weeks and months , all the known incidents of their love were enlarged . distorted , touched up , and modified , till the original reality bore but a slight resemblance to the counterfeit presentation by surrounding tongues . yet , upon the whole , neither the man nor the woman lost dignity by sudden death . misfortune had struck them gracefully , cutting off their erratic histories with a catastrophic dash .
[female] came in , and advancing towards the bed , slowly drew the curtains . emma 's head was turned towards her right shoulder . the corner of her mouth , which was open , seemed like a [female] hole at the lower part of her face . her two thumbs were bent into the palms of her hands . a kind of white dust besprinkled her lashes .
`` but i do not see why [male] should not do just as well as dresden , '' continued the baronet , mr. [male] found himself quite unable to make his [male] understand that the greater disruption caused by a residence abroad . the feeling that a new kind of life had been considered necessary for her . and that she must submit to the new kind of life . might be gradually effective , while the journeyings and scenes which had been common to her year after year would have no effect .
within ten feet of the sedan chair and directly behind the tall guard stood a small group of people . he and beverly , engrossed in each other , had not heard their approach , how long they had been silent spectators of the little scene only the intruders knew . the startled , abashed eyes of the girl in the chair were not long in distinguishing the newcomers . a pace in front of the others stood the gaunt . shadowy form of count marlanx .
presently he came in sight of the cross . and was aware of a most fierce encounter raging on the road before it . there were seven or eight assailants , and but one to keep head against them . but so active and dexterous was this one , so desperately did he charge and scatter his opponents . so deftly keep his footing on the ice , that already , before [male] could intervene .
she leaned forward to break a green sprig from the branch over the chimneypiece . the strong draft drew in her fleecy skirt . and in an instant she was enveloped in flames , [female] . save me , help me , cried a voice of fear and agony . and before anyone could reach her , before he himself knew how the deed was done .
he knew the excitement of a near division upon the estimates . but he had never yet seen a poor man stake his last [male] . and [male] back from off the table a small hatful of gold . a little exercise after an early dinner was , he had been told . good for his wife ; and he agreed therefore that , on their second evening at [male] .
`` quite well , thank you , '' said she . with grave courtesy ; but i saw that her beautiful face was thin and worn . her pallor greater than ever , she had never been a person much given to mirthfulness . but now she looked as if all smiles had passed forever from her lips . a certain secret sat upon them , and closed them in an outline .
knowing [male] as he did , he easily reconstructed the tragedy . thinking that his brother had run away with christine daae , [male] had dashed in pursuit of him along the brussels road . where he knew that everything was prepared for the elopement . failing to find the pair , he hurried back to the opera . remembered [male] 's strange confidence about his fantastic rival and learned that the viscount had made every effort to enter the cellars of the theater and that he had disappeared .
only the labour of writing is such ( especially so as to construe , and challenge a reader on parts of speech . and hope to be even with him ) ; that by this pipe which i hold in my hand i ever expect to be beaten . as in the days when old doctor twiggs . if i made a bad stroke in my exercise , shouted aloud with a sour joy . [male] ridd .
the dogs were all excitement at the prospect of a move . they barked and careered about [female] , and rushed off as if they were going to run ten miles at a stretch . and then wheeled round with alarming suddenness and flew back to mrs. [female] and their master . the nearest way to graybridge lay across all that swelling sea of lovely meadow land . and there were a good many stiles to be crossed and gates to be opened and shut .
did she perceive that vague , invisible thread ? was she , in her decrepit mendicancy . still youthful enough to remember something of the old happier days ? and could she , in this dark night and winter of her wretched life . still recognise the dawn ? we know not : but it appears that .
unknightly and ungenerous if you will , why should we waste more words about the matter let [male] part now , none . my whole past was but a schoolboy 's dream . today my life begins , farewell . now are you satisfied ? have you not seen my dearest friend , and my most loved companion . thrust from me like a common kitchen knave !
the eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against the light . and the great flame shaped sun stone beyond them ; and the stone of sacrifice midway . presently the night wind died out , and the quivering little pools in the cup like hollows of the stones lay still . at the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the dip eastward . a mere dot , it was the head of a man approaching them from the hollow beyond the sun stone .
while gavroche was deliberating , the attack took place . abruptly and hideously , the attack of the tiger on the wild ass . the attack of the spider on the fly . montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose , bounded upon the old man , seized him by the collar . grasped and clung to him , and gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream .
upon this i took courage , and handled poor [female] . which being young i had feared at first to do , he groaned very feebly . as i raised him up ; and there was the wound . a great savage one , gaping and welling in his right side , from which a piece seemed to be torn away . i bound it up with some of my linen .
[female] lay facing the window , and did not at once turn her head . and sue was wicked enough , despite her penitence , to wish for a moment that jude could behold her forerunner now . with the daylight full upon her , she may have seemed handsome enough in profile under the lamps . but a frowsiness was apparent this morning ; and the sight of her own fresh charms in the looking glass made sue 's manner bright . till she reflected what a meanly sexual emotion this was in her .
if he had not seized the regulating tackle at that instant it would have fallen . but his powerful hand was there , and it descended steadily , when the brother of [male] . [male] , that powerful and sagacious toper , that poor [male] fisherman . who used to talk familiarly with the grand admiral of [location] , went to the rescue of the galley langeron . in distress in the bay of ambleteuse .
it speedily appeared , that if the knight was not a complete master of the minstrel art . his taste for it had at least been cultivated under the best instructors . art had taught him to soften the faults of a voice which had little compass . and was naturally rough rather than mellow , and , in short , had done all that culture can do in supplying natural deficiencies . his performance , therefore , might have been termed very respectable by abler judges than the hermit .
she had ordered her coach to drive her to the `` crown '' inn . once there , she told her coachman to give the horses food and rest . then she ordered a chair , and had herself carried to the house in pall mall where sir [male] ffoulkes lived . among all [male] 's friends who were enrolled under his daring banner . she felt that she would prefer to confide in sir [male] ffoulkes .
it was a fearfully monotonous , narrow , and uneventful life which olivia arundel led at [organization] rectory . at three and twenty years of age she could have written her history upon a few pages . the world outside that dull [location] town might be shaken by convulsions . and made irrecognisable by repeated change ; but all those outer changes and revolutions made themselves but little felt in the quiet grass grown streets . and the flat surrounding swamps , within whose narrow boundary olivia arundel had lived from infancy to womanhood .
the population stares at me in return . on one side , i remark three or four cottages . and a bit of open ground ; also an inn named `` the cross hands , '' and a bit more of open ground ; also a tiny , tiny butcher 's shop . with sanguinary insides of sheep on one blue pie dish in the window .
this is how these details came to my knowledge , on the 12th of march . 1847 , i saw in the rue [female] a great yellow placard announcing a sale of furniture and curiosities . the sale was to take place on account of the death of the owner . the owner 's name was not mentioned , but the sale was to be held at 9 . rue d'antin , on the 16th , from 12 to 5 , the placard further announced that the rooms and furniture could be seen on the 13th and 14th .
if the suspected ones met , it was by such adroit contrivances that even [female] 's vigilance could not encounter them together . a simple call at her house by the doctor had nothing irregular about it . and that he had paid two or three such calls was certain , what had passed at those interviews was known only to the parties themselves . but that [male] was under some one 's influence [male] soon had opportunity of perceiving . winter had come on , owls began to be noisy in the mornings and evenings .
there was the large , hard featured clock on the sideboard , which he used to see bending its figured brows upon him with a savage joy when he was behind hand with his lessons . and which , when it was wound up once a week with an iron handle . used to sound as if it were growling in ferocious anticipation of the miseries into which it would bring him . but here was the old man come back , saying , [male] . i will go before and light you .
he said to himself that no doubt they would save her . the doctors would discover some remedy surely , he remembered all the miraculous cures he had been told about . then she appeared to him dead , she was there . before his eyes , lying on her back in the middle of the road . he reined up , and the hallucination disappeared , at quincampoix .
the first wreck i was in the train struck a split switch with the result that the cars turned over and piled up in a ditch . that happened in [location] , we were forced to crawl out through the windows . like a prairie dog out of his hole . no one was killed but the passengers were all pretty well shaken up and somewhat scared . as soon as the cars got comfortably piled up and the passengers were able to speak they all commenced yelling for the porter .
he crouched down where he had been standing and covered his face with his hands . he tried to deafen as well as to blind himself , that he might neither hear nor see anything of the coming event of which he . an inhabitant of monkshaven at that day . well understood the betokening signs , [male] had taken the larger angle of the sands before turning up towards the bridge . he came along now nearing the rocks , by this time he was sufficiently buoyant to whistle to himself .
when she went to mr [male] 's , he was always there . when she went to mrs [female] 's , he came there on any pretence . as if to keep her in his sight , a week had not gone by . when she found him to her astonishment in the lodge one night . conversing with the turnkey on duty , and to all appearance one of his familiar companions .
david soon learned that they had among themselves their class distinctions . certain among them holding their heads high , in the knowledge of having a self respecting ancestry . and training their children to reckon themselves no `` common trash , '' however much they deprecated showing the pride that was in them . many days passed after frale 's departure before [male] learned more of the young man 's unhappy deed .
as no two were dressed alike , it was impossible to recognize characteristic styles of attire . some were in the rude , baggy costumes of the peasant as she had imagined him . others were dressed in the tight fitting but dilapidated uniforms of the soldiery . while several were in clothes partly european and partly oriental , there were hats and fezzes and caps . some with feathers in the bands , others without .
[female] , by virtue of her temperament . was necessarily either lover or devote , and she vibrated so gracefully between these two conditions that nobody who had known the circumstances could have condemned her inconsistencies . to be led into difficulties by those mastering emotions of hers . to aim at escape by turning round and seizing the apparatus of religion . which could only rightly be worked by the very emotions already bestowed elsewhere -- it was .
i now come to the chief portion of your letter , this boy of glencore 's . i rather like the account you give of him . better than you do yourself , imaginative and dreamy he may be . but remember what he was , and where we have placed him . a moonstruck , romantic youth at a german university .
the decision to which [female] binet finally came was . naturally , the only one possible in the face of so firm a resolve as that of andre louis . who held the trumps , of course there were further discussions . before all was settled , and [male] binet was brought to an agreement only after an infinity of haggling surprising in one who was an artist and not a man of business . one or two concessions were made by andre louis ; he consented , for instance .
`` it is very generous of you to make excuses for the lady , '' mrs. [female] said ; and would fain have talked longer of this subject . but [male] concluded his visit at this juncture . not caring to discuss his troubles with the sympathetic widow , he left the great gloomy gorgeous house in cavendish square more than ever convinced of [male] 's affection for his friend . more than ever puzzled by [male] indifference to so advantageous an alliance .
after she had read every syllable of this letter . it dropped from her hands ; but she uttered not a word . there was , however , a paleness in her face , a deadness in her eye . and a kind of palsy over her frame . which miss [female] , who had seen her in every stage of her uneasiness .
it had even been rumored that they were to be forbidden to continue longer their practice of going up and down the country , ministering everywhere . were to be compelled to restrict their labors to their own colleges at santa [female] and santa [female] . when something to this effect was one day said in the senora moreno 's presence . two scarlet spots sprang on her cheeks . and before she bethought herself , she exclaimed .
in some such welter of homely phrase ( how foreign to these classic pages ! ) did mrs. [female] utter her pain , the duke answered her tersely but kindly . he apologised for going so abruptly , and said he would be very happy to write for her future use a testimonial to the excellence of her rooms and of her cooking . and with it he would give her a cheque not only for the full term 's rent . and for his board since the beginning of term .
sir [male] mounted his horse and rode alone . ever northward , for he knew that the holy graal was hidden in a castle somewhere in the north among the warring barons . many days he rode without adventure . until on a day he came to an old and venerable wood . dark and thick and close .
he said `` your nose is beautiful , your chin is adorable . '' but it sounded like lies , and she was disappointed , hurt . even when he said , whispering with truth , i love you . i love you , it was not the real truth . it was something beyond love .
choking back the great sobs that rose in his breast , [male] sank upon his knees beside [male] . and buried his face in his arms like a heartbroken boy . for several moments there was a silence , punctuated by the rasping breath of the wounded man . suddenly this sound ceased , and [male] felt a cold fear leap through him . he listened , neither breathing nor lifting his head , in that interval of pulseless quiet a terrible cry came from [male] 's lips .
a violent state , if ever such existed , there were only two ways of escaping from it . one was to go resolutely to [male] , and restore to his cell the convict from the galleys , the other . javert quitted the parapet , and , with head erect this time . betook himself , with a firm tread . towards the station house indicated by a lantern at one of the corners of the place [male] chatelet .
love participates of the soul itself . it is of the same nature , like it . it is the divine spark ; like it . it is incorruptible , indivisible , imperishable , it is a point of fire that exists within us . which is immortal and infinite , which nothing can confine , and which nothing can extinguish .
it is easy to see at once that a tailor of such renown , instead of running after customers . made difficulties about obliging any fresh ones , and so [female] declined to fit bourgeois . or those who had but recently obtained patents of nobility , a story used to circulate that even [male] . in exchange for [male] supplying him with a full suit of ceremonial vestments as cardinal . one fine day slipped letters of nobility into his pocket .
the stores of fire and water in the sky poured out incessantly without exhausting themselves . the undulations of the wind above and below were like the movements of a dragon . nightfall brought scarcely any deeper night , the change was hardly felt , for the darkness was never complete . tempests alternately darkening and illumining by their lightnings , are merely intervals of the visible and invisible . all is pale glare , and then all is darkness , spectral shapes issue forth suddenly .
then came the hush of expectancy , the doors swung open . the curtains parted and the princess entered , she was supported by the arm of her tall uncle . caspar of halfont , pages carried the train of her dress . a jeweled gown of [female] , as she advanced to the throne . calm and stately , those assembled bent knee to the fairest woman the eye ever had looked upon .
while this was going on downstairs , [female] was sitting upstairs with [female] gresham in the schoolroom . the old schoolroom , so called , was now a sitting room , devoted to the use of the grown-up young ladies of the family . whereas one of the old nurseries was now the modern schoolroom , [female] well knew her way to the sanctum . and , without asking any questions , walked up to it when her uncle went to the squire . on entering the room she found that [female] and the lady alexandrina were also there .
now they feared no longer , her husband was a retired merchant . very rich , not very strong in health , and devoted to his bride , rumours soon made their way to vavasor hall . and to queen [female] , that mrs greenow was quite a pattern wife . and that mr greenow considered himself to be the happiest old man in lancashire . and now in her prosperity she quite forgave the former slights which had been put upon her by her relatives .
i shall trouble you meanwhile to prevent his forming any other attachment when he comes to town . ask him to your house occasionally , and talk to him of frederica . that he may not forget her , upon the whole . i commend my own conduct in this affair extremely , and regard it as a very happy instance of circumspection and tenderness . some mothers would have insisted on their daughter 's accepting so good an offer on the first overture .
the entire plot had been known from the beginning , [male] had been an emissary of [male] 's throughout . and every letter that passed to and from the various personages had passed through the secretary 's hands and been deciphered in his house . there never had been one instant in which mr. [male] had been at fault . or in the dark : he had gone so far , it was reported . as to insert in one of the letters that was to go to mr. [male] a request for the names of all the conspirators .
the young girls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns . the gaze of impeccability does not embarrass innocence . thanks to these children , there was , among so many austere hours . one hour of ingenuousness , the little ones skipped about . the elder ones danced , in this cloister play was mingled with heaven .
the words -- caressing , and by strong constraint made calm and soothing . were yet firm , ursula resisted no more , but let him take muriel -- little , unconscious , cooing dove ! lulled by her father 's voice she once more opened her eyes wide . [female] passed the candle before them many times . once so close that it almost touched her face .
after that , there was no more to be said , zillah -- [female] over her domestic occupations and eager to get back to her kitchen . seized the first chance of leaving the room ; going out in such a hurry that she forgot to close the door after her . we all looked at each other , to what conclusion did the nurse 's strange answers point ? it was plainly impossible for oscar ( no matter how quick his temper might be ) . to feel jealous of a man of grosse 's age and personal appearance .
`` land ho , '' was the cry yesterday morning . i shivered as i gazed at this , the first land since [location] a few centuries ago . there was no sun , and the morning was damp and cold with a brisk wind that penetrated any garment . the deck thermometer marked 30 -- two degrees below freezing point . and now and then easy squalls of snow swept past , all of the land that was to be seen was snow .
he urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds . but the farther he went the more disorganized they were . the highroad on which he had come out was thronged with caleches . carriages of all sorts , and russian and austrian soldiers of all arms . some wounded and some not , this whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the french batteries stationed on the pratzen heights .
upon the following day , i held some council with my mother . not liking to go without her permission , yet scarcely daring to ask for it . but here she disappointed me , on the right side of disappointment . saying that she had seen my pining ( which she never could have done . because i had been too hard at work ) , and rather than watch me grieving so .
it met a long felt want , in time of trouble . it became a haven of refuge . from all sides , people poured into it . emerging cautiously when the marauders had disappeared , in the whole history of the castle . there is but one instance recorded of a bandit attempting to take the place by storm .
the only motion in the air was that of the dripping . microscopic particles of drizzling mist . the bare twigs in the garden were hung with transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves . the earth in the kitchen garden looked wet and [female] and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance merged into the dull . moist veil of mist , [female] went out into the wet and muddy porch .
before they started there came a letter to [male] from [male] . which shall be given entire , because it will tell the reader more of [male] 's happiness than would be learned from any other mode of narrative . i have just had a letter from hugh . and that makes me feel that i should like to write to you . dear hugh has told me all about it .
the news carried only one message to [male] 's mind . it seemed to explain something which had begun to perplex him . why [male] had not met him at the quay . and why [male] had not heard of his coming , clearly [male] was at present at ballure . he had not yet received the telegram addressed to [male] .
the absence of mr delvile contributed to her happiness . and she much rejoiced in having now the prospect of a speedy opportunity to explain to his son . whatever had appeared mysterious in her conduct respecting mr belfield , if she had any thing to regret . it was merely the impossibility , at this time . of waiting for the counsel of mr [location] .
she even made up a very pretty , very passionate speech for him in her own mind . quite sufficiently strong to prevail upon her , and to overthrow the scruples which she felt that she ought to have . at telling the parents of her pupils that she did not intend to resume school . and that they must find another place of education for their daughters . in the last week but one of the midsummer holidays .
her gloved hand promptly emerged from the fox skins to meet mine . and i found myself looking into a pair of gray eyes bent steadily and gravely upon me . it was discomfiting , that cool , penetrating , searching gaze . it was not that it was challenging , but that it was so insolently business like . it was much in the very way one would look at a new coachman he was about to engage .
happily , however , during that spring , they never , but once , got anything but empty nests . or eggs—being too impatient to leave them till the birds were hatched ; that once . [male] , who had been with his uncle into the neighbouring plantation . came running in high glee into the garden , with a brood of little callow nestlings in his hands . [male] and [male] , whom i was just bringing out .
amory stepped outside the door and shivered slightly at the late night wind . a wind that stirred a broken fender on the mass of bent metal to a plaintive , tinny sound . [female] and her mother drove into town at four . and they rode up smiling prospect avenue , through the gay crowd . to have tea at cottage , the clubs had their annual dinners that night .
she spoke simply , and had a pretty voice , but it was an [female] voice . [female] was surprised , because to find that she was an [male] upset his theories . he had never heard of [male] girls coming over to [location] with the object of training to be governesses . he went away and found the rug , returning with it in two or three minutes . the girl thanked him again , getting up and wrapping the dark soft thing round her shoulders and body .
the next thing he did was to send for me . and in great alarm and flurry i put on my best clothes . and hired a fashionable hairdresser , and drank half a gallon of ale . because both my hands were shaking , then forth i set , with my holly staff . wishing myself well out of it , i was shown at once .
[female] lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm september afternoon . wondering what his neighbors were about , but too lazy to go and find out . he was in one of his moods , for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory . and he was wishing he could live it over again . the hot weather made him indolent .
`` yes ; i think you would better go now , '' then she rose and went . and he let her leave the room without giving her a shilling ! his bantering tone , in speaking of his own position . had been successful , it had caused her to take herself off quietly , she knew enough of his usual manner to be aware that his threats of self destruction were probably unreal . but , nevertheless , what he had said had created some feeling in her heart which had induced her to yield to him .
yea , said sir [male] , and therewithal the king smote down his head . and in his heart he feared sore that sir [male] should get him such worship in the realm of logris wherethrough that he himself should not be able to withstand him . thus sir [male] had great cheer with king mark . and with queen [female] beale isoud . the which was glad of sir [female] ', words .
[female] obeyed orders in so far that she went to bed . but it may be questioned if she slept much , i do not think she dared to dream wakingly . life had been so hard for this poor [female] , the path on which she had had to walk had been so strait . that she could not whisper to her own heart the hopes that might wait on the future . but she watched the great revolving light bestarring the short hours of the summer night .
it said this , and more , which i could not then interpret , i understood but too well the change in her manner . to greater kindness and quicker readiness in interpreting all my wishes . before others -- to constraint and sadness , and nervous anxiety to absorb herself in the first occupation she could seize on . whenever we happened to be left together alone , i understood why the sweet sensitive lips smiled so rarely and so restrainedly now . and why the clear blue eyes looked at me , sometimes with the pity of an angel .
the multitude , today , flocked to his temple . but of that temple he and i regarded ourselves as the ministers . we held , justly , as i think , that we had done more for his memory than anyone else . and we had done it by opening lights into his life . he had nothing to fear from [male] because he had nothing to fear from the truth .
i , having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet things . left him preaching and her shivering , and betook myself to bed with little hareton . who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping round him . i heard [male] read on a while afterwards . then i distinguished his slow step on the ladder , and then i dropped asleep .
[male] had striven hard to shake hands with his hero . [male] and some other reformers as ardent and as decent as himself . the police were very determinate that there should be no such interruption to their programme for getting mr. [male] off the scene . mr. [male] , who had his own ideas as to his right to shake hands with any gentleman at westminster hall who might choose to shake hands with him . became uneasy under the impediments that were placed in his way , and expressed himself warmly as to his civil rights .
each of them , also , was so arranged that it ended right under a shaft pierced in the rock for the admission of light and air . on examining them carefully , however , i saw that there was a difference between them that had at first escaped my attention , viz . that one of the tables , that to the left as we entered the cave . had evidently been used , not to eat upon , but for the purposes of embalming . that this was beyond all question the case was clear from five shallow depressions in the stone of the table .
[male] felt that he was playing a part and the lines came quite naturally . he announced that all had a right to lead their own lives and looked at marjorie 's husband menacingly . as if daring him to doubt it , marjorie 's husband spoke of the sanctity of the home . forgetting that it had not seemed very holy to him lately ; [male] continued along the line of the right to happiness ', . marjorie 's husband mentioned firearms and the divorce court .
on that walk to the station they talked of pictures and music . contrasting the english and french characters and the difference in their attitude to art . but to jolyon the colours in the hedges of the long straight lane . the twittering of chaffinches who kept pace with them . the perfume of weeds being already burned , the turn of her neck .
the scotsman 's flashed back a precisely similar message , men had fought for [female] . but never in her presence , her eyes dilated , she had not the slightest impulse to throw herself between the two antagonists . indeed , she stepped back , so as not to be in the way , a short sharp fight . how much better that is than bad blood , she hoped the better man would win . and she rather hoped this man was the duke .
the next day was a dreary one for emma . everything seemed to her enveloped in a [female] atmosphere floating confusedly over the exterior of things . and sorrow was engulfed within her soul with soft shrieks such as the winter wind makes in ruined castles . it was that reverie which we give to things that will not return . the lassitude that seizes you after everything was done .
octavia , on the contrary , did not ask what he meant by it . she chose to seem rather well entertained , and did not notice that she was being frowned down . there was no reason why she should not find lord lansdowne entertaining . he was an agreeable young fellow , with an inexhaustible fund of good spirits . and no nonsense about him , he was fond of all [male] novelty .
but what of the intellectual accord between himself and her ? she had not been deceived in that , he and she had really been wedded in mind as well as in heart . but until now there had not arisen in their lives one of those searching questions which call into play emotions rooted far below reason and judgment . in the dark primal depths of inherited feeling . it is easy to judge impersonal problems intellectually , turning on them the full light of acquired knowledge .
the moon cast on the ground beyond the trees a shadow which reached to the garden seat . she was quite pale ; her mouth was partly open , as with a suppressed cry of surprise . she had just half risen from the bench , and sunk again upon it . there was in her attitude a mixture of [female] with a desire to fly . her surprise was enchantment mingled with timidity , she had upon her lips almost the light of a smile .
there was no ring of footsteps , the crowd walked on sand and for the most part with naked feet . so that if for a rare moment the sharp high cries and the perpetual voices ceased . the figures of men and women flitted by noiseless as ghosts . and even at night , when the streets were most crowded and the uproar loudest . it seemed that underneath the noise , and almost appreciable to the ear .
but alas , i was utterly disappointed ; for although i waited and waited for hours . with an equal amount both of patience and peril . no lorna ever appeared at all , nor even the faintest sign of her , and another thing occurred as well . which vexed me more than it need have done , for so small a matter . and this was that my little offering of the trout and the new laid eggs was carried off in the coolest manner by that vile carver doone .
in the waist below a little knot of shaggy seamen were crowding to the larboard bulwarks . looking out to sea ; on the forecastle there was another similar assembly . all staring intently ahead and towards the land , they were off cape roca at the time . and when captain [male] saw by how much they had lessened their distance from shore since last he had conned the ship . he swore ferociously at his mate who had charge of the wheel .
i stared and stared again -- he was perfectly right -- the torches that were to light our entertainment were human mummies from the caves ! on rushed the bearers of the flaming corpses . and , meeting at a spot about twenty paces in front of us . built their ghastly burdens crossways into a huge bonfire , heavens ! how they roared and flared , no tar barrel could have burnt as those mummies did .
she caught up her basket as she spoke and was making an unsteady rush away from them . when the same bystander checked her with his hand on her sleeve . and urged her to come with him and see the parish doctor . strengthening herself by the utmost exercise of her resolution . the poor trembling creature shook him off , almost fiercely , and took to flight .
when maimie realized that the service was really over , she felt as if she had been in church for a week . after the benediction the congregation passed out into the churchyard and disposed themselves in groups about the gate and along the fences discussing the sermon and making brief inquiries as to the `` weal and ill '' of the members of their families , mrs. [female] . leaving hughie and maimie to wander at will , passed from group to group . welcomed by all with equal respect and affection , young men and old men .
his was not one of those light natures that rise above adversity merely by virtue of their own buoyancy . it was in the fortitude of a high spirit that he was proof against it . it is impossible to conceive [male] giving way to despondency or prostrated by dejection . as for poverty , it was with him a thing to be laughed over . and the only sigh he ever allows to escape him is when he says .
left to himself , he would have builded a private car . and kept it at the nearest railway station , [male] , five miles away . but those into whose hands he had committed himself for his english training had little knowledge of railways and less of private cars . the one they knew was something that existed in the scheme of things for their convenience . the other they held to be `` distinctly american '' ; and , with the versatility of his race .
changed in person , and in one respect changed in character . i can not absolutely say that she is less beautiful than she used to be . i can only say that she is less beautiful to me , the second change . the change that i have observed in her character . has not surprised me , because i was prepared for it in this case by the tone of her letters .
i was amazed at mother 's words . being so unlike her ; while i loved her all the more because she forgot herself so . in another moment in ran annie . ay and [female] also , knowing by some mystic sense ( which i have often noticed . but never could explain ) that something was astir , belonging to the world of women .
day was dawning when [female] quitted the inn . so happy , so gay , so exhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight . that his joy was like to burst his horse girths , however , recalling the advice of his host as to the requisites he ought to carry with him . especially that referring to money and shirts , he determined to go home and provide himself with all . and also with a squire , for he reckoned upon securing a farm labourer .
the worst of it was that she seemed unable to extricate herself from the ever increasing tangle arising out of her folly . miss wangle and [organization] had been sufficiently serious factors . requiring all her watchfulness to circumvent them ; but now aunt [female] had thrown herself precipitately into the mêlee . and heaven alone knew what would be the outcome , had her aunt been a man or merely a woman . patricia argued , she would not have been so dangerous ; but she possessed the deliberate logic of the one and the quickness of perception of the other .
to accept this theory was to apply it ; for nothing could long divert amherst from his main purpose . and all the thwarted strength of his will was only gathering to itself fresh stores of energy . he had never been a skilful lover , for no woman had as yet stirred in him those feelings which call the finer perceptions into play . and there was no instinct to tell him that [male] 's sudden conformity to his wishes was as unreasoning as her surrender to his first kiss . he fancied that he and she were at length reaching some semblance of that moral harmony which should grow out of the physical accord .
gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part . its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to mrs. [female] . that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer . and that he must learn to do without her , her intentions were unchanged . her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness .
dearest : it was so nice and comedy to see the mother aunt this morning importantly opening a letter from you all to herself with the pleasure quite unmixed by any inclosure for me . or any other letter in the house to me so far as she was aware . i listened to you with new ears . discovering that you write quite beautifully in the style which i never get from you . do not , because i admire you in your more formal form , alter in your style to me .
my benefactor picked up my two bundles , and , in spite of my expostulations . carried them with him , he took me through the door inscribed ausgang . and the whole thing seemed so extremely simple now , that my astonishment as to how i could have lost myself increased every minute . he went before me to the waiting room . put my bundles upon one of the sofas , and we went to the door .
sir [male] 's bon mot had gone the round of the brilliant reception rooms . the prince was enchanted , he vowed that life without blakeney would be but a dreary desert . then , taking him by the arm , had led him to the card room . and engaged him in a long game of hazard . sir [male] , whose chief interest in most social gatherings seemed to centre round the card table .
a letter from his friend , captain harville . having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of captain harville 's being settled with his family at lyme for the winter . of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other , captain harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before . and captain wentworth 's anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to lyme . he had been there for four and twenty hours , his acquittal was complete .
behind this terrible figure the sun used to set , flaming , or mild , or sullen . and the vast arms of it were outlined against the gorgeous sky . or in the half dark it glimmered like a ghost and seemed to move . it had been there so long that none could remember the legend of it . it was a grim shape , scattered here and there were quaint wildernesses and pleasaunces .
i was struck , on entering the drawing room , by the curious contrast . rather in material than in colour , of the dresses which they now wore . while mrs. [female] and miss [female] were richly clad ( each in the manner most becoming to her age ) . the first in silver grey , and the second in that delicate primrose yellow colour which matches so well with a dark complexion and [female] hair . miss [female] was unpretendingly and almost poorly dressed in plain white muslin , it was spotlessly pure .
it was in the low and miserable hut we speak of . just as night set in of a raw november , that four of these raftsmen sat at their smoky fire . in company with two travellers on foot . whose humble means compelled them to await the arrival of some one rich enough to hire the raft . meanly clad and wayworn were the strangers who now sat endeavoring to dry their dripping clothes at the blaze .
and so , deeply reflecting , she caused the chief of the eunuchs to summon the princess of feminine propriety . the white jade concubine and all the other exalted beauties of the heavenly palace . in due course of time these ladies arrived . paying suitable respect and obeisance to the mother of his divine majesty . they were resplendent in king fisher ornaments .
[male] , with a gesture , directed him to be silent . placing his finger on his lips and drawing back by degrees . without [male] being able to see his legs move , the comte . still paler than [male] , followed his son , painfully traversing briers and bushes . stones and ditches , [male] not appearing to touch the earth .
[female] met the lovers at the inn outside the town . and after stabling the horse they entered the town together . the trumpet major informing them that the watering place had never been so full before , that the court . the prince of wales , and everybody of consequence was there . and that an attic could scarcely be got for money , the king had gone for a cruise in his yacht .
he was rather disappointed , therefore ; but he bore his disappointment pretty well . and expressed a placid and rather stoical satisfaction at the turn which affairs had taken . so [male] went back to [location] , to surrender his chambers in figtree court . and to make all due inquiries about such ships as sailed from liverpool for sydney in the month of june . he had lingered until after luncheon at grange heath .
old women and children were turning these , or pounding acorns in the deep stone bowls . others were beating the yucca stalks , and putting them to soak in water . the oldest women were sitting on the ground , weaving baskets . there were not many men in the village now ; two large bands were away at work . one at the autumn sheep shearing , and one working on a large irrigating ditch at [location] .
you are considering how insufferable it would be to pass many evenings in such society . indeed , i am quite of your opinion , i was never more annoyed , the insipidity and yet the noise . the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people ! what would i give to hear your strictures on them , your conjecture is totally wrong . i assure you , my mind was more agreeably engaged .
[male] darted around arranging the room , then he flung the door wide and called , `` ready ! '' [male] climbed the stairs and entered the door . as [male] expected , his gaze centred and stopped , [male] began taking packages from his hands . still gazing [male] yielded them , then he stepped forward when [male] placed the chair . and said : mr. [male] , this is [male] .
the first page of his paper was fairly alive with fresh and important dispatches , chiefly foreign . at length , after allowing himself to become really interested in a [location] dispatch of some international consequence . he turned his eyes again to the mirror . she was leaning slightly forward , holding the open book in her lap . but reading , with straining eyes , an article in the paper he held .
at all these missions felipe asked in vain for alessandro . they knew very little , these northern indians , about those in the south , they said . it was seldom one from the southern tribes came northward , they did not understand each other 's speech . the more felipe inquired , and the longer he reflected , the more he doubted alessandro 's having ever gone to monterey . at santa [male] he made a long stay .
she had never been idle , she had never been fond of pleasure . she had neglected no acknowledged duty , he did not doubt that she was now on her way to heaven . he took his hands down from his head . and clasping them together , said a little prayer , it may be doubted whether he quite knew for what he was praying . the idea of praying for her soul , now that she was dead .
in less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich . which is good , and had made every one about him rich , which is better . he was a stranger in the department . of his origin , nothing was known ; of the beginning of his career , very little . it was rumored that he had come to town with very little money .
to my surprise and relief , [female] obeyed without further argument . dimly it passed through my mind that she had been profiting by her lessons lately . i threw one glance over my shoulder . more , i am afraid , to see whether my dear [female] were on her way to safety than through anxiety for miss [female] . the three figures had already disappeared in the darkness , and [female] and i gave ourselves to the work of lighting up .
soon , to the rattle of blocks and the tramping of feet and the calling and shouting of men . was added the creak of the steamer 's hoists . and the groan of her donkey engines as her crew began the work of dumping out the cribbing by hand and steam . on the cleared space on the wharf , and then , when the last big stick had gone over . [female] began sending bundles of two inch cribbing .
the large church was very full ; there seemed not to be another space for a human being . people who were not much given to frequenting the house of god on a week day evening . had certainly been drawn thither at this time , sadie ried sat beside ester in their mother 's pew . and [male] , with a sober look on his boyish face . sat bolt upright in the end of the pew .
why , indeed ? a moment of pessimism , a sudden conviction of the undeniable prose of life . a lapse of the illusion which sustains youth midway between heaven and earth . a desperate attempt to reconcile herself with facts . she could only recall a moment , as of waking from a dream . which now seemed to her a moment of surrender , but who could give reasons such as these for doing what she had done ?
kingsport is a quaint old town , hearking back to early colonial days . and wrapped in its ancient atmosphere , as some fine old dame in garments fashioned like those of her youth . here and there it sprouts out into modernity , but at heart it is still unspoiled . it is full of curious relics , and haloed by the romance of many legends of the past . once it was a mere frontier station on the fringe of the wilderness .
my life , as time went on , grew into a kind of fossilized dream . in which i rose up and lay down , practiced so many hours a day . ate and drank and took my lesson . and it seemed as if i had been living so for years . and should continue to live on so to the end of my days -- until one morning my eyes would not open again .
but nothing more could be learned of the grinder than that he had been at the cottage on the sunday morning . and had gone away , according to his wont , the old woman swore that he slept there the whole of saturday night . but of course the policemen had not believed her statement . when does any policeman ever believe anything ? of the pony and cart the old woman declared she knew nothing . her son had no pony , and no cart .
perhaps mr. [male] was deficient in his sense of humour . he skimmed through the account hurriedly , then starting up from his leather arm chair he walked to the door and turned the key . for some reason for which he would have found it difficult to account he walked on tiptoe . then he took the paper , and standing under the cluster of electric bulbs that hung from the centre of the ceiling . he read the report again , carefully this time .
she began to look with her own eyes ; to see and to apprehend the deeper undercurrents of life . no longer was she content to `` feed upon opinion '' when her own soul had invited her , after a little while , a few days . in fact , edna went up and spent a week with her children in iberville . they were delicious february days , with all the summer 's promise hovering in the air .
mr. [male] came to his enemy 's house for one special purpose . the woman he loved was in [female] 's power . it was his duty to explain that fatal meeting in [female] 's rooms . to justify clarissa 's conduct in the eyes of her husband . it was not that he meant to surrender his hope of their future union .
she reached a turn -- was it here ? took the left and came to what should have been the outlet into the long . low room , but it was only another glittering passage with darkness at the end . she called again , but the walls gave back a flat . lifeless echo with no reverberations , retracing her steps she turned another corner .
he walked to and fro half a dozen times without speaking . and , if he had but guessed it , he might have been comforted to know that his manhood flowed in upon him . as a tide coming in over a flat beach , these instants added more years to him than as many months that had gone before . his boyhood was passing , since experience and conflict . whether it end in victory or defeat .
[male] rose insensibly into the void , smiling , still calling with gesture . he departed towards heaven , [male] uttered a cry of tenderness and terror . he looked below again , he saw a camp destroyed . and all those white bodies of the royal army , like so many motionless atoms . and , then , raising his head , he saw the figure of his son still beckoning him to climb the mystic void .
but he had no words to express this desire of deliverance . and so he did not speak of it , and from habit asked for the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied . `` turn me over on the other side , '' he would say . and immediately after he would ask to be turned back again as before , give me some broth . take away the broth , talk of something .
levin had long before made the observation that when one is uncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and meek . one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their touchiness and irritability . he felt that this was how it would be with his brother . and his brother nikolay 's gentleness did in fact not last out for long . the very next morning he began to be irritable , and seemed doing his best to find fault with his brother .
i had walked to the window and looked out across the city , as i turned suddenly i found pickering 's eyes bent upon me with curious intentness . i had never liked his eyes ; they were too steady . when a man always meets your gaze tranquilly and readily , it is just as well to be wary of him . `` he treated me a lot better than i deserved , '' i said , with a heartache that i had not known often in my irresponsible life .
he enjoyed burlesque shows . billiards , and [male] , and was always looking back upon his last intrigue or forward to his next one . in his youth his taste had run to loud ties . but now it seemed to have faded , like his vitality , and was expressed in pale lilac four in hands and indeterminate gray collars . [male] was listlessly struggling that losing struggle against mental , moral , and physical anamia that takes place ceaselessly on the lower fringe of the middle classes .
what would become of her boy ? she was afraid to think ; thinking did no good . she must not think , but must just work on , washing the bedclothes until she could wash no longer . wash , wash , all the week long . and it was only by working on till one o'clock in the morning that she sometimes managed to get the sabbath free from washing . never , not even in the house in chelsea , had she had such hard work .
the effort of packing aided me to rally a little -- but did no more towards restoring me to my customary tone of mind . i sat down helplessly , when i had done ; feeling the serious necessity of clearing matters up between lucilla and myself . before i went away , and still as ignorant as ever how to do it . to my own indescribable disgust , i actually felt tears beginning to find their way into my eyes ! i had just enough of pratolungo 's widow left in me to feel heartily ashamed of myself .
old days , and [male] in grey silk shot with palest green . he looked , sideways , at [organization] 's face . rather colourless no light , no eagerness , that love affair was preying on her . a bad business , he looked beyond , at his wife 's face . rather more touched up than usual , a little disdainful -- not that she had any business to disdain .
but every one knew that it was a question of moments only before some arab . quicker or luckier than the rest , would succeed in firing the trail of gunpowder already laid . the gate would be blown up , then would follow a rush of the enemy and the second stand of the defenders behind the barricade . last of all , the retreat to the dining room , among the first precautions [female] had taken was that of locking the doors of all rooms except the dining room . and pulling out the keys , so that , when the enemy got into the quadrangle .
it was ten o'clock before captain [female] and miss [female] met at breakfast . and they had before that been together in mrs. [female] 's room . the doctor had told captain [male] that his aunt was very ill . very ill , dangerously ill. she had been wrong to go into such a place as the cold . unaired town hall , and that , too , in the month of november .
sir [male] was at that moment looking round him . and saying , `` but where is [male] ? why do not i see my little [female] ? '' and on perceiving her , came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her . calling her his dear [male] , kissing her affectionately , and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown ! [female] knew not how to feel , nor where to look , she was quite oppressed .
the length of the way , joined to the dirt of the roads . made her truly sensible of his consideration , in affording her this safe conveyance , when she arrived at the post office . the words , `` oh , you are come at last , '' struck her ear . from the street ; but not conceiving herself to be addressed , they failed to catch her attention . till she saw , waiting to give her his hand , while exclaiming , what the deuce can have made you so long in coming ? ', young [female] .
carrying his shoes in his hand , he went softly downstairs for he could see from the top of the flight that neither [female] nor her daughter was down yet . as the kitchen shutters were not unclosed , it was mrs. rose 's habit to rise early . and have all bright and clean against her lodgers came down ; but then , in general . she went to rest before nine o'clock , whereas the last night she had not gone till past twelve . [female] went about undoing the shutters , and trying to break up the raking coal .
let him sail safely into algiers with these two ships both captured in the name of [male] and his prophet . one of them an argosy so richly fraught , a floating treasure house . and he need have little fear of what his enemies and the crafty evil sicilian woman might have wrought against him in his absence . then he made inquiry touching his two english captives . to be informed that [male] had taken charge of them .
and as a matter of fact existence with [female] and [female] did run smoothly . it is true that the neighbors did not call any more , or only a very few of them . and there was no social life to speak of ; but the deprivation was hardly noticed . there was so much in the home life to please and interest . [female] was learning to play the piano , and to play quite well , she had a good ear for music .
there was no use in denying it , no use in lulling and coaxing her conscience any longer . it had been for one whole week in a new atmosphere . it had roused itself ; it was not thoroughly awake as yet . but restless and nervous and on the alert -- and would not be hushed back into its lethargic state . this it was which made ester the uncomfortable companion which she was this morning .
as she threw down the letter again , she caught sight of her face in the glass . it was reddened now , and wet with tears . it was almost like a companion that she might complain to . that would pity her , she leaned forward on her elbows . and looked into those dark overflooding eyes and at the quivering mouth , and saw how the tears came thicker and thicker .
the officers lighted cigarettes , the civilians formed a line on the jetty under the roof of the shed . and waited , passports in hand , before a door that gleamed with yellow light . faces looked pale and anxious , the blockade was on , and [location] had said that no ships would cross that night . as if defiantly the boulogne boat , near at hand . was ablaze , on the shore side at least , with lights , stewards came and went .
the phalanx of stars marched augustly across the heavens . claiborne lifted his face gratefully to the cool night breeze . for he was worn with the stress and anxiety of the day . and there remained much to do , the bungalow had been speedily transformed into a hospital . one nurse , borrowed from a convalescent patient at the springs .
it was not it , for it was a twenty sou piece . but the thenardier found it to her advantage , she put the coin in her pocket . and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child . accompanied with the remark , `` do not let this ever happen again , '' cosette returned to what the thenardier called `` her kennel , '' and her large eyes , which were riveted on the traveller , began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before .
all this amherst saw with that cruel insight which had replaced his former blindness . he was , in truth , more ashamed of the insight than of the blindness . it seemed to him horribly cold blooded to be thus analyzing , after two years of marriage . the source of his wife 's inconsistencies . and , partly for this reason , he had put off from month to month the final question of the future management of the mills .
this is written of , i am sensible , as if it had lasted a year . it lasted about five days , expecting [female] all the time . i dared not go out , except when i took provis for an airing after dark . at length , one evening when dinner was over and i had dropped into a slumber quite worn out . for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreams .
it might be advisable to introduce here a sketch of contemporary poetry contributed by mr. [male] . and thus terse and learned and altogether out of keeping with the rest , but mrs. [male] was of opinion that it was too bare . and made one feel altogether like a good little girl in a lecture room . which was not at all in keeping with her father , it was put on one side . now came the period of his early manhood , when various affairs of the heart must either be concealed or revealed .
but then reason spoke again , what , after all , was this blood of which she had taught herself to think so much ? would she have been more honest , more fit to [male] an honest man 's hearthstone . had she been the legitimate descendant of a score of legitimate duchesses ? was it not her first duty to think of him . of what would make him happy ? then of her uncle -- what he would approve ?
in fact , she was undergoing a sort of discipline for the refractory which . as little as possible like conversion , bends half the self with a terrible strain . and exasperates the unwillingness of the other half , [female] had an active divination rather than discernment of refractoriness in her . and what had happened about [male] quickened his suspicion that there was an increase of it dependent on the occasions when she happened to see [male] . there was some `` confounded nonsense '' between them : he did not imagine it exactly as flirtation .
and now , on christmas eve , robin , [male] and the two ladies entered the cathedral as dusk was falling . first passing through the burial ground , over the wall of which leaned the rows of houses in whose windows lights were beginning to burn . the very dimness of the air made the enormous heights of the great church more impressive . before them stretched the long nave , over seven hundred feet from end to end . from floor to roof the eye travelled up the bunches of slender pillars to the dark ceiling .
while the author of this missive was making up her mind to dispatch it [female] stackpole formed a resolve which was accompanied by no demur . she invited [female] to take a walk with her in the garden . and when he had assented with that alacrity which seemed constantly to testify to his high expectations . she informed him that she had a favour to ask of him . it may be admitted that at this information the young man flinched .
he was a tall good-looking young fellow , however , with a candid [female] face and an agreeable manner . so [female] was not a little angry with her father for his rudeness . still more angry with him for his encouragement of her other admirer . a man called [male] , who lived about a mile from the grange . and farmed his own land , an estate of some extent for that part of the country .
he fairly reeled and leant against the wall , his mouth hanging open . for the king was in bed , and had a beard . yet there was the king , fully dressed and clean shaven , and he was kissing the queen 's hand . while she gazed down on him in a struggle between amazement . fright , and joy , a soldier should be prepared for anything .
he said , very gratefully and very humbly indeed , precisely in the way that the door slid back . he slid aside , and i stepped out on deck , i was still weak from my prolonged immersion . a puff of wind caught me . —and i staggered across the moving deck to a corner of the cabin . to which i clung for support .
nobody ever tried to go with [organization] again , i suppose they were afraid of emmeline . [organization] 's beauty soon faded , she was always kind of sweet looking . but her bloom went , and she got shyer and limper every year of her life . she would not have dared put on her second best dress without asking emmeline 's permission . she was real fond of cats and emmeline would not let her keep one .
she had interfered , or had endeavoured to interfere , in some arrangements as to his health and comfort . and he had turned upon her with an order that the child should be at once sent back to him . and that she should immediately quit siena , when i said that louey could not be sent . and who could send a child into such keeping , -- he told me that i was the basest liar that ever broke a promise . and the vilest traitor that had ever returned evil for good , i was never to come to him again , never .
when , late that night , he went upstairs after long pacings of the garden . he was surprised to see a light in her room . she was not given to midnight study , and fearing that she might be ill he knocked at her door . there was no answer , and after a short pause he turned the handle and entered . in the great canopied westmore couch , her arms flung upward and her hands clasped beneath her head .
did suffering in any form appall her ? no , suffering was neither good nor bad . and this essential thing ? in the eyes of every single person she detected a flame . as if a spark in the brain ignited spontaneously at contact with the things they met and drove them on . the young women looking into the milliners windows had that look in their eyes . and elderly men turning over books in the second hand book shops .
dalyrimple was twenty three and he had never worked , his father had given him two years at the state university and passed away about the time of his son 's nine day romp . leaving behind him some mid victorian furniture and a thin packet of folded paper that turned out to be grocery bills . young dalyrimple had very keen gray eyes , a mind that delighted the army psychological examiners . a trick of having read it -- whatever it was . some time before , and a cool hand in a hot situation .
he occupied the few minutes of her absence by writing the testimonial . it had shaped itself in his mind as a short ode in doric greek . but , for the benefit of mrs. [female] . he chose to do a rough equivalent in english , this ms. she received together with the duke 's cheque . the presentation was made some twenty minutes after she had laid her accounts before him .
at first she had a great terror of [female] discovering her retreat . he had found her at [location] ; why should he not find her at spa ? for the first month of her residence in the quiet inland watering place she hardly stirred out of doors without her father . and sat at home reading or painting day after day . when she was longing to be out in the wood with her baby and nurse .
then she eat the food , and drank a drop of wine . and allowed the old woman to take her away to the bed that had been prepared for her . of her husband she saw no more for four days . on the next morning a note was brought to her , in which sir hugh told her that he had returned to [location] . it was necessary , he said , that he should see his lawyer and his brother .
after some hesitation , natural to a novice in the art of kissing . she brought her lips into very shy and gentle contact with my forehead . i took the small gift as a loan , and repaid it promptly . and with generous interest , i know not whether [female] was really much altered since the time i first saw her . but , as i looked at her now , i felt that she was singularly changed for me .
[female] did not mean to expose himself to shooting , his time of life for risk of life being now well over and the residue too valuable . but his counsels , and his influence , and above all his warehousemen . well practised in beating carpets , were of true service to us . his miners also did great wonders , having a grudge against the doones . as indeed who had not for thirty miles round their valley ?
the doctor , as he went downstairs . muttered something about sir [male] haphazard . and sir [male] ; but these great names were much thrown away upon poor [male] . the doctor entered the room first , and the heiress followed him with downcast eyes and timid steps . she was at first afraid to advance , but when she did look up .
there is no man who has given himself up to a growing passion and has not yet revealed it . who does not pass through many an hour of unrest , how could it be otherwise ? in his absence from the object of his feeling every man who lives is his possible rival . every woman his possible enemy , every event a possible obstacle in the way to that he yearns for . and from this situation there is nothing which can save a man .
he followed it , the distant murmur had grown into a low moaning over the tree tops . and with it the wind was coming stronger , and the smoke thicker . for a mile he continued along the path . and then he stopped , knowing he had come to the dead line . over him was a swirling chaos , the fire wind had grown into a roar before which the tree tops bent as if struck by a gale .
these notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect . in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army . but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit . and applauded himself for having put it in action . an inhabitant of [male] rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines .
time had reconciled [female] to her brother 's choice . and she now deigned to smile upon the lovers , very much to [male] 's satisfaction . he had been too proud to supplicate her good graces ; but he was pleased that his only sister should show herself gracious and affectionate to the girl he loved so fondly . during this second visit of his , therefore , [female] came very often to [location] house . sometimes accompanied by her uncle , sometimes alone ; and there was perfect harmony between the elder and younger lady .
it was then that he straightened away from her and looked without seeing at the blur of light which was the phonograph . [male] , glancing up , saw him then as he was in the photograph . face set and head thrust forward . and that clean cut drive of jaw and backward flow of heavy hair that marked him all man . and virile man , `` i do love you , harvey , ''
nay , he himself had taken a part in so speaking of her . now she had no money , but he knew well that she was a creature the very reverse of poor . what should he do for her ? in what way should he himself behave towards her ? in the early days of his youth , before the cares of the world had made him hard . he had married his [male] without a penny .
but everything was transfigured , everything beautiful , everything mysterious . she was like one who had gone to sleep on the sea , with only the unattainable horizon round about . and awakened in harbour in a strange land that was warm and lovely and full of [female] . she closed her eyes again , so that nothing might disturb the contemplation of the mystery . she folded her round arms as a pillow behind her head .
there were a few instructions in a halting voice and with much clearing of the throat from the pale little man . and a moment later june walked the gauntlet of the eyes of her schoolmates . every one of whom looked up from his book or hers to watch her as she went to her seat . miss [female] pointed out the arithmetic lesson and , without lifting her eyes . june bent with a flushed face to her task .
they came to a long stretch of level ground then . smooth and hard ; and the horses as with common consent set out to gallop shoulder to shoulder in a wild . exhilarating skim across the plain , talking was impossible , the man reflected that he was making great strides in experience . first a prayer and then a pledge , all in the wilderness . if any one had told him he was going into the west for this .
was this what made her heart palpitate annoyingly when she heard the horse 's footsteps on the gravel ? when [female] , who opened the door to [female] . came to tell her that he was in the drawing room ? the hours of preparation and the triumph of the situation were apparently of no use . she might as well have seen [female] coming suddenly on her in the midst of her despondency . while walking into the drawing room , she had to concentrate all her energy in that self control .
nothing would satisfy him until he had examined every part of the invention . and [location] trembled lest then and there his brain be stimulated to action and he make a bolt for home to complete without delay some sudden scheme the novelty had engendered . however , no such calamity occurred , he drank his tea with satisfaction and was presently borne off by mr. [male] to inspect a recently purchased barometer . after he had gone the company broke up into little groups . mrs. [female] and [location] betook themselves to a shaded corner .
high and low was miss [female] sought ; through length and breadth was the house ransacked , vainly . not a trace , not an indication , not so much as a scrap of a billet rewarded the search . the nymph was vanished , engulfed in the past night , like a shooting star swallowed up by darkness . deep was the dismay of surveillante teachers . deeper the horror of the defaulting directress .
`` i am sure of that , '' i replied earnestly . and the next moment , without a farewell glance . a touch of my hand , he went over to katherine . and , in a voice very different in volume than the suppressed tones of his conversation to me . i heard him apologize to her for having to go away at once , heard her laughing reply that after the french hospitals she did not fear the [location] streets .
he retired to rest early , but his sleep was fitful from the sense that sue was so near at hand . at some time near two o'clock , when he was beginning to sleep more soundly . he was aroused by a shrill squeak that had been familiar enough to him when he lived regularly at marygreen . it was the cry of a rabbit caught in a gin . as was the little creature 's habit , it did not soon repeat its cry .
the chauffeur who drove nevill 's car was an algerian who looked as if he might have a dash of dark blood in his veins . beside him sat the kabyle servant . who , in his picturesque embroidered clothes , with his jaunty fez . appeared amusingly out of place in the smart automobile . which struck the last note of modernity , the chauffeur had a reckless .
they talked of her , they praised her . they made high flown speeches to her , at which she blushed . and glowed , and opened her lovely , half uncomprehending eyes , she was glad they liked her . grateful for their attentions , half confused under them . but it was some time before she understood the full meaning of their homage .
the territory of the rao of [female] lay within ten miles of the bridge . and findlayson and hitchcock had spent a fair portion of their scanty leisure in playing billiards and shooting black buck with the young man . he had been bear led by an english tutor of sporting tastes for some five or six years . and was now royally wasting the revenues accumulated during his minority by the indian government . his steam launch , with its silverplated rails , striped silk awning .
as the car swung through the gates of baldry court she sat up and dried her eyes . she looked out at the strip of turf . so bright that one would think it wet , and lighted here and there with snowdrops and scillas and crocuses . that runs between the drive and the tangle of silver birch and bramble and fern . there is no esthetic reason for that border ; the common outside looks lovelier where it fringes the road with dark gorse and rough amber grasses .
the foam from below spat its flakes contemptuously upon this broken and forlorn outcast of the sea . [female] did not expect to find only a portion of the ship existing . nothing in the description , in other respects so precise . of the captain of the shealtiel had led him to anticipate this division of the vessel in the centre . it was probable that the `` diabolical crash '' heard by the captain of the shealtiel marked the moment when this destruction had taken place under the blows of a tremendous sea .
moreover , he had himself revealed his situation . nothing forced him to this , if any one learned who he was . it was through himself , in this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation . there was acceptance of peril , for a condemned man . a mask is not a mask , it is a shelter .
[female] succeeded in making his bargain with sir raffle buffle . he accepted the private secretaryship on the plainly expressed condition that he was to have leave of absence for a fortnight towards the end of april . having arranged this he took an affectionate leave of mr love . who was really much affected at parting with him , discussed valedictory pots of porter in the big room . over which many wishes were expressed that he might be enabled to compass the length and breadth of old ruffle 's feet .
one morning , on awaking , she saw on her window two vases filled with flowers . one was a very beautiful and very brilliant but cracked vase of glass , it had allowed the water with which it had been filled to escape . and the flowers which it contained were withered , the other was an earthenware pot . coarse and common , but which had preserved all its water , and its flowers remained fresh and crimson . i know not whether it was done intentionally , but [female] esmeralda took the faded nosegay and wore it all day long upon her breast .
she was accustomed to talk to her brother very freely in rather school girl french before her husband . to whom that language was as the most recondite of tongues , and who heartily admired her for superior knowledge . he sat staring at her now , and eating bread and butter with a simple relish . which in itself was enough to mark him out as a man to be trampled upon . on the fourth day after his interview with [male] .
the gondolier dozing on the landing roused himself to receive her . and to proffer two envelopes , the upper one was a telegram for strefford . she threw it down again and paused under the lantern hanging from the painted vault . the other envelope in her hand , the address it bore was in [male] 's writing . `` when did the signore leave this for me ? has he gone out again ? ''
the ecclesiastic passed the holy water sprinkler to his neighbour . this was homais , he swung it gravely . then handed it to [male] , who sank to his knees in the earth and threw in handfuls of it . crying , `` adieu , '' he sent her kisses . he dragged himself towards the grave .
miss [female] came to the gate . and stood there looking out , with a skye terrier in her arms . [female] drew back a little , and flung his cigar into the brook . she had not seen him yet , her looks were wandering far away across the green . as if in search of some one , he could not stand there for ever looking at her .
this successful morning left no [female] impressions on [female] . she had been a little frightened , both by miss lavish and by mr , [male] , she knew not why . and as they frightened her , she had . strangely enough , ceased to respect them , she doubted that miss lavish was a great artist . she doubted that mr , [female] was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose .
at his name the count started , and he instantly remembered the dying cavalier . whose countenance the glooms had concealed from his view . his heart thrilled with secret agony , yet he resolved to withhold his terrible conjectures from [male] . of whom he learned that [female] , with herself . had been taken by banditti in the way from the villa which had offered them so hospitable a reception after the shipwreck .
all were at once hushed into silence , well acquainted with the temper of [female] . which at some times admitted of much military familiarity , and at others exacted the most precise respect . although the latter humour was of much more rare occurrence , hastening to a more reverent distance from the royal person . they attempted to drag along with them the marabout . who , exhausted apparently by previous fatigue , or overpowered by the potent draught he had just swallowed .
for the doones being now in direct feud with the present government . and sure to be crushed if that prevailed , had resolved to drop all religious questions . and cast in their lot with monmouth . and the turbulent youths , being long restrained from their wonted outlet for vehemence . by the troopers in the neighbourhood , were only too glad to rush forth upon any promise of blows and excitement .
sir [male] filled another glass from the decanter so awkwardly that he upset it and spilt all the wine over the table . `` my sight seems to be failing me , '' he muttered to himself . in an odd , muffled voice , he slowly set the glass up again . refilled it , and drained it once more at a draught . i began to fear , from his look and manner .
the promised visit from `` her friend , '' as [female] called miss crawford . was a formidable threat to [female] , and she lived in continual terror of it . as a sister , so partial and so angry , and so little scrupulous of what she said . and in another light so triumphant and secure , she was in every way an object of painful alarm . her displeasure , her penetration , and her happiness were all fearful to encounter .
of whom was jondrette speaking ? whom had he recognized , [male] ? the father of `` his ursule '' ? what , did jondrette know him ? was marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark to him ? was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved . who that young girl was ? who her father was ? was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled ?
far away the dusty vines overhanging wayside cottages . and the monotonous wayside avenues of parched trees without shade . drooped beneath the stare of earth and sky . so did the horses with drowsy bells . in long files of carts , creeping slowly towards the interior .
no such gratification as this filled the bosom of mr moffat on the morning of the barchester election . to him had been brought no positive assurance of success by his indefatigable agent , mr nearthewinde . it was admitted on all sides that the contest would be a very close one . and mr nearthewinde would not do more than assert that they ought to win unless things went very wrong with them . mr nearthewinde had other elections to attend to , and had not been remaining at courcy castle ever since the coming of miss dunstable .
there was a simultaneous sigh , which created quite a little gust , as the last hope fled . and the treat was ravished from their longing lips . scarlet with shame and anger . [female] went to and fro six dreadful times , and as each doomed couple . looking oh , so plump and juicy , fell from her reluctant hands , a shout from the street completed the anguish of the girls .
at a period in the history of [location] when the treasures of the centuries were to be had for the asking or the taking . [male] chose that which others elected to cast away , for him the fertile wheat and fruit lands of [location] 's smiling valleys . the dull placer gold in her foot hill streams . and the free grass , knee deep , on her cattle and sheep ranges held no lure . for he had been first among the humboldt redwoods and had come under the spell of the vastness and antiquity .
the fear of detection awakened [male] to a sense of guilt . and , besides , he found out , that , in spite of all idle talk and careless slander . he could not help believing that kinraid was in terrible earnest when he uttered those passionate words . and entreated that they might be borne to sylvia , some instinct told [male] that if the specksioneer had only flirted with too many . yet that for sylvia robson his love was true and vehement .
he suddenly slackened his pace , and with a vicious tug settled his wool hat more firmly upon his small skull . he went now at a dog trot and oscar was closing upon him rapidly . then , quite near the sheds , zmai wheeled about and charged his pursuer headlong . at the moment he turned , oscar 's revolver bit keenly into the night . [male] , looking toward the slope , saw the flash before the hounds at the stables answered the report .
`` yes , but they pay extra for wine , '' after this remark she remained motionless and silent . to her tired eyes [female] throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream . they began to sort their clothes for packing . for there was no time to lose , if they were to catch the train to [female] . [female] , when admonished , began to move to and fro between the rooms , more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. [female] .
making the most of the advantage [male] had thus given him . canalis entered upon his defence with such warmth . such eagerness , and with a passion so exquisitely expressed , as he thanked her for a confidence in which he could venture to see the dawn of love . that she found herself suddenly as much compromised with the poet as she feared to be with the grand equerry . canalis , feeling the necessity of prompt action .
the next morning , when [female] presented herself at [female] 's . she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days ; but on the contrary sad as death . [female] asked the poor girl what was the matter with her . but she , as her only reply , drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him . this letter was in [male] 's handwriting .
the man had turned away quickly , and was going heavily along the quay , thank god . it was too late to be moved by that temptation , too late to be bought by that bribe . already he had taken the irrevocable course , he had made the irrevocable step . he could not now go back , but the awful penalty of the island 's undeceiving ! the pain of that moment when everybody would learn that he had deceived the whole world !
the lesser hordes had commenced looting and quarreling among themselves . so it was decided that we collect what warriors we could . man as many vessels as possible with zodangan prisoners and make for helium without further loss of time . in the middle of the afternoon we sighted the scarlet and yellow towers of helium . and a short time later a great fleet of zodangan battleships rose from the camps of the besiegers without the city .
she saw , indeed , many stumfoldians , but it seemed that their eyes looked at her harshly . and she was quite sure that the coachmaker 's wife treated her with marked incivility as they left the porch together . miss [female] had frequently waited for her on sunday mornings , and walked the length of two streets with her . but she encountered no miss [female] near the church gate on this morning . and she was sure that mrs stumfold had prevailed against her .
her hair was not dressed ; and her lace cap was all on one side . the upper part of her was clothed in a loose jacket of blue merino . the lower part was robed in a dimity dressing gown of doubtful white . in one hand , she held a dirty dogs' eared book . which i at once detected to be a circulating library novel , her other hand supported a baby enveloped in flannel .
viola , would it be better , madam , than i am ? i wish it might , for now i am your fool , [female] . by innocence i swear . and by my youth , i have one heart . one bosom , and one truth , and that no woman has . nor never none shall [female] be of it .
he sprang upon her , and seizing her by the arm . whirled her to her feet with no little violence . snatching the powder flask from her , and dealing her a sound box on the ear . and this choice volley was with such spirit and fury poured forth . that sir [male] let his hand drop from the bell .
the dried lavender flowers rustled faintly as [male] reverently lifted the garments . giving out the long stored sweetness of summers gone by , the white had changed to an ivory tint . growing deeper every day , there were eleven night gowns . all made exactly alike , with high neck and long sleeves , trimmed with tucks and lace . only one was in any way elaborate , the sleeves were short .
for some months past now she had neither seen colonel osborne . nor heard from him , he had certainly by his folly done much to produce the ruin which had fallen upon her . but it never occurred to her to blame him , indeed she did not know that he was liable to blame . mr. [male] always spoke of him with indignant scorn . and [male] had learned to think that much of their misery was due to his imprudence .
he told her , a few words at a time . of the new work mr. [male] had assigned to him . and in his enthusiasm he gave her a little idea of what it would mean to him . this opportunity to build an elevator the like of which had never been seen in the country before . and which would be watched by engineers from [location] to [location] .
marguerite shuddered , she felt that from this man she could expect no mercy . all powerful , he held the beloved life in the hollow of his hand . she knew him too well not to know that , if he failed in gaining his own ends . he would be pitiless , she felt cold in spite of the oppressive air of opera house . the heart appealing strains of the music seemed to reach her .
partly in his old habit of submission , partly because his not doing it might injure his benefactor . and partly because he would as soon do it as anything else . [male] took up the refrain this time . [male] laughed , and fell to smoking with his eyes shut , possibly another quarter of an hour elapsed before mr [male] 's step was heard upon the stairs . but the interval seemed to [male] insupportably long , his step was attended by another step .
troy wandered along towards the south . a composite feeling , made up of disgust with the , to him . humdrum tediousness of a farmer 's life . gloomy images of her who lay in the churchyard , remorse , and a general averseness to his wife 's society . impelled him to seek a home in any place on earth save weatherbury .
`` and so i have decided , [female] , '' she said after telling him of all her doubts and troubles . i must do it , there is no help for it . as i think you will see , i have asked for ten days ', respite . i really hardly know why , except that it is a respite , and now what is there left to say to you except good-bye ? i love you , [male] , i make no secret of it .
she was in love with leon . and sought solitude that she might with the more ease delight in his image . the sight of his form troubled the voluptuousness of this mediation . emma thrilled at the sound of his step . then in his presence the emotion subsided , and afterwards there remained to her only an immense astonishment that ended in sorrow .
the wind from the sea was scarcely felt in the roads . but the form of the cashmere was rapidly growing less , the sloop . according to all appearance , was sailing fast , it was already nearly off the casquets . there was no foam around the gild holm 'ur ; no wave beat against its granite sides . the water rose peacefully , it was nearly level with [organization] 's shoulders .
there were men on the passenger list who were being seen off by fathers . by mothers , by sisters , by cousins . and by aunts , in the steerage there was an elderly jewish lady who was being seen off by exactly thirty seven of her late neighbours in rivington street . and two men in the second cabin were being seen off by detectives . surely the crowning compliment a great nation can bestow , the cavernous customs shed was congested with friends and relatives .
mac spoke in such a pathetic tone , and gave such a gloomy glare at the aforesaid curl . that rose laughed in his face and added to his woe by handing him her cloak . he surveyed it gravely for a minute . then carefully put it on wrong side out and gave the swan's down hood a good pull over the head . to the utter destruction of all smoothness to the curls inside .
he felt it in the looks of an important french official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier . whom they met on the way , he felt it in the [male] sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field . and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the french officer had read out when he came that morning . [male] had been taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men . and it seemed that they might have forgotten him .
it was no longer torture torn and hateful , as i had seen it when she was cursing her dead rival by the leaping flames . no longer icily terrible as in the judgment hall , no longer rich , and sombre . and splendid , like a tyrian cloth , as in the dwellings of the dead . no , her mood now was that of [female] triumphing . life -- radiant , ecstatic , wonderful -- seemed to flow from her and around her .
so that when the [male] had placed the candle , slanted himself . and called in mrs. garland to have her opinion on the meaning of any hieroglyphics that he might encounter in his course . he found that he was to be additionally assisted by the opinions of the other neighbours . whose persons appeared in the doorway , partly covering each other like a hand of cards . yet each showing a large enough piece of himself for identification .
poor [female] stumbled back to her desk , her tears combining with the coal dust to produce an effect truly grotesque . never before had her beloved , sympathetic teacher spoken to her in such a tone or fashion . and [female] was heartbroken , [female] herself felt a prick of conscience but it only served to increase her mental irritation . and the second reader class remember that lesson yet . as well as the unmerciful infliction of arithmetic that followed , just as [female] was snapping the sums outclair donnell arrived breathlessly .
the good news spread quickly through the house . and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood , it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . to be sure , it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss [female] bennet come upon the town . or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world . in some distant farmhouse , but there was much to be talked of in marrying her .
so he took a little turn up the street . away from piccadilly , through a narrow passage that there is in those parts , and by some stables . and down into piccadilly , and again to bolton street , during which little tour he had made up his mind that it could hardly become his duty to teach her that great lesson on this occasion . she must undoubtedly be taught to know that he was there , but not so taught on this . his first visit , that lesson should quickly precede his offer .
[male] walked about this room , which he had for years known by heart . with a strange sense of metamorphosis in his own life . the familiar objects around him , from lady [male] 's gently smiling portrait to the also human and urbane faces of the lions on the pilasters of the chimney piece . seemed almost to belong to a previous state of existence which he was revisiting in memory only . not in reality ; so deep and transforming had been the impressions he had lately experienced .
the man was coming out as he went in , they were approaching each other . at two paces more they were side by side . he looked at the man with creeping horror . the man looked at him with amazement and dread . thus , eye to eye , they crossed and passed .
those who are in favour of his carrying off a lady ? ( all hold up their hands except a bishop . ) those of the contrary opinion ? oh , you are never satisfied , yes , unless you undertake to carry off a lady at once . i do not care what lady -- any lady -- choose your lady . you perish in inconceivable agonies , [male] . carry off a lady ? certainly not , on any account , i have the greatest respect for ladies .
of course a man living in [location] . and having to earn his bread out in the world , must be more worldly than a country girl . but the fact of his being able to love such a girl , to choose such a one for his wife . was not that alone sufficient proof that the world had not enslaved him ? my heart is on the allington lawns , ', he said .
what that cell contained , no one knew ; but from the strand of the terrain . at night , there was often seen to appear , disappear , and reappear at brief and regular intervals . at a little dormer window opening upon the back of the tower . a certain red , intermittent , singular light which seemed to follow the panting breaths of a bellows . and to proceed from a flame , rather than from a light , in the darkness .
the pleasantest room in the house was set apart for beth . and in it was gathered everything that she most loved . flowers , pictures , her piano . the little worktable , and the beloved pussies , father 's best books found their way there . mother 's easy chair , jo 's desk .
we all felt mechanically in our pockets ; but i . being nearest , was first in the field , it was a shock to see [female] wave my handkerchief away with a gesture of horror . and bury her face in a far inferior one tendered by [female] . for a minute , i did not know what she meant . then it broke upon me that the arabs
the inside of the hut , as it now presented itself . was cosy and alluring , and the scarlet handful of fire in addition to the candle . reflecting its own genial colour upon whatever it could reach , flung associations of enjoyment even over utensils and tools . in the corner stood the sheep crook , and along a shelf at one side were ranged bottles and canisters of the simple preparations pertaining to ovine surgery and physic . spirits of wine , turpentine , tar .
after this meeting , [female] felt a slight diminution of the oppression which weighed upon her . she could not have borne to have come unexpectedly upon derek , and , now that there was no danger of that . she found life a little easier , the days passed somehow . and finally there came the morning , when , accompanied by [male] -- voluble and explanatory about the details of what he called `` getting everything settled '' she rode in a taxi to take the train for southampton .
through this scene of confusion , cedric rushed in [male] of rowena . while the faithful gurth , following him closely through the `` melee '' . neglected his own safety while he strove to avert the blows that were aimed at his master . the noble saxon was so fortunate as to reach his ward 's apartment just as she had abandoned all hope of safety . and , with a crucifix clasped in agony to her bosom .
they had been standing in the entry , closing the front door and turning the key . as before , she threw open the door of the adjoining room and asked him to walk in . wildeve entered , the room appearing to be empty ; but as soon as he had advanced a few steps he started . on the hearthrug lay clym asleep , beside him were the leggings . thick boots , leather gloves .
the abate felt the full force of this reproof . but disdaining to appear sensible to it , restrained his resentment , his wounded pride thus exasperated . and all the malignant passions of his nature thus called into action . he was prompted to that cruel surrender which he had never before seriously intended . the offence which madame [male] menon had unintentionally given his haughty spirit urged him to retaliate in punishment .
moreover it was possible , it was perhaps even probable that the old lady had consigned her relics to her bedroom . to some battered box that was shoved under the bed , to the drawer of some lame dressing table . where they would be in the range of vision by the dim night lamp . nonetheless i scrutinized every article of furniture , every conceivable cover for a hoard . and noticed that there were half a dozen things with drawers .
franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting place . and from whence his eyes followed the motions of [male] and his guides . who , holding torches in their hands , had emerged from a vomitarium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum . and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins . resembling , as they glided along , some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui .
i finished the letter with a numb feeling at my heart . it seemed to me as if one of the foundations of my life had given away . when [male] had left me after that miserable reunion dinner where he had been hurt so cruelly by the news of my marriage during his year 's absence . he had said -- ah , how well i remembered the words -- i shall not see you again , dear girl , unless you need me .
but [female] did not care for a new gown , and told her father so . with a word or two of thanks for his offer . she did not desire fine dresses ; she had indeed been looking over and furbishing up her wardrobe of late . with a view to that possible flight of hers . and it was to her cotton working gowns that she had paid most attention .
however , he , like [male] borgia . knew the value of time ; and , in order to avoid fruitless toil . he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe . struck the earth with the butt of his gun . and finding nothing that appeared suspicious , returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard .
paul [female] did not leave stony stringford farmhouse till dusk upon that bright summer 's day . and the friendly twilight is slow to come in the early days of july . however a man may loathe the [male] , [male] stopped at the deserted farmhouse . wandering in and out of the empty rooms , strolling listlessly about the neglected garden . or coming to a dead stop sometimes , and standing stock still for ten minutes at a time .
as the pain began to resolve itself into throbs and stabs . from the continuous strain in which at first it had shown itself . a strain that was like a shrill horn blowing . or a blaze of bluish light -- he began to see more . and to understand a little , there were four or five faces looking down on him .
the spaniard ushered [male] into one of the reception rooms . which looked cold and chill in the winter daylight . except the grand piano , there was no trace of feminine occupation in the room . it looked like an apartment kept only for the reception of visitors . an apartment which lacked all the warmth and comfort of home .
when darya alexandrovna lay in bed that night . as soon as she closed her eyes . she saw vassenka veslovsky flying about the croquet ground . when , after evening tea and a row by night in the boat . darya alexandrovna went alone to her room , took off her dress .
the bishop did not pass a comfortable night ; but in the morning his wife did read his letter . and after that things went a little smoother with him . she was pleased to say that , considering all things ; seeing , as she could not help seeing . that the matter had been dreadfully mismanaged , and that great weakness had been displayed . seeing that these faults had already been committed , perhaps no better step could now be taken than that proposed in the letter .
they were not , it is but fair to say , all that the princess sabloukoff had depicted them . but there was still a very fair sprinkling of witty , [male] talkers . the ease of admission permitted any former intimate to present his friend . and thus at once , on the very first night of receiving , the countess saw her salons crowded . they smoked , and sang , and laughed , and played ecarte .
it was clear and frosty , above the dirty , ill lit streets . above the [female] roofs , stretched the dark starry sky . only looking up at the sky did [male] cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised . at the entrance to the arbat square an immense expanse of dark starry sky presented itself to his eyes . almost in the center of it , above the prechistenka boulevard .
he began to regard her with a quiet , kindly commiseration . which in its turn changed into a sort of brotherly affection . he discovered that he liked her . he liked her very much , she was so big and jolly and robust . and spoke in such a clear , full voice , he was glad that she was patting his hand .
with open eyes , later i asked the nature of the strange bond that had called her to my side . i do not understand that fully myself , she said -- that is part of the knowledge we must wait for . but you have the eyes that see , and that is a tie nothing can break . i had waited long in the house of beauty for you . i guided you there , but between you and me there is also love .
that 's all right in theory , but this is a practical world . my pull got you into the institute . my pull can get you out , you give up this wild idea or give up your job ! what did i tell you ? financial force ! they still try it , you see .
this was a more serious interruption than the other , because she never knew exactly what she wanted . and half a dozen requests would bolt from her . no one of which was clearly stated , dressed in plum colored velveteen , with short . gray hair , and a face that seemed permanently flushed with philanthropic enthusiasm . she was always in a hurry , and always in some disorder .
ancient heresies were attacked and exposed with completeness amounting to annihilation . modern errors , into which our `` friends '' of the different denominations had fallen . were deplored and corrected , and all possible misapplications of the doctrine to practical life guarded against . on the positive side the need , the ground . the means , the method , the agent .
concerning the new clothes , the simple couple were like children . they were up and down , all night , to see if it was not nearly daylight . so that they could put them on , and they were into them at last as much as an hour before dawn was due . then their pleasure -- not to say delirium -- was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered . the king had slept just as usual -- like the dead , the marcos could not thank him for their clothes .
some one rapped at his door , he called out `` avanti , '' and he would have been less surprised to see either of those ladies than paolo with the account he had ordered to be made out . it was a long , pendulous , minutely itemed affair , such as the traveller 's recklessness in candles and firewood comes to in the books of the continental landlord . and it almost swept the floor when its volume was unrolled . but it was not the sum total that dismayed colville when he glanced at the final figure . that , indeed , was not so very great , with all the items ; it was the conviction .
on the second night about daylight the weather became more threatening and i saw in the distance a long column which looked like smoke . it seemed to be coming towards me at the rate of a mile a minute . it did not take it long to reach me . and when it did i struggled on for a few yards but it was no use . tired as i was from packing my heavy outfit for more than 48 hours and my long tramp .
certainly it was , a large square , chiefly grass . level as a bowling green , with borders round , beyond , divided by a low hedge . was the kitchen and fruit garden . my father 's pride , as this old-fashioned pleasaunce was mine . when , years ago , i was too weak to walk , i knew .
[female] now turned pale and cold . horrour thrilled through her veins , and almost made her heart cease to beat . lord [female] saw the change . and , hastily drawing towards her a chair , besought her to be seated , she was unable to refuse . for she had not strength to stand ; but , when again he would have taken her hand .
this was on a tuesday , the fifth day of the trial . and upon the whole perhaps the most interesting , a long array of distinguished persons . of women as well as men , -- was brought up to give to the jury their opinion as to the character of mr. [male] . mr. [male] was the first , who having been his tutor when he was studying at the bar . knew him longer than any other londoner , then came his countryman laurence fitzgibbon .
it was running water , too , it came in . and went out , through the ancient pipes , the old abbot kept his word . and was the first to try it , he went down [male] and shaky . leaving the whole [male] community above troubled and worried and full of bodings . but he came back white and joyful , and the game was made , another triumph scored .
but in this doubtful stage of [male] 's introduction he was helped by what we mortals rashly call good fortune . i suppose no doctor ever came newly to a place without making cures that surprised somebody . cures which may be called fortune 's testimonials . and deserve as much credit as the written or printed kind , various patients got well while [male] was attending them . some even of dangerous illnesses ; and it was remarked that the new doctor with his new ways had at least the merit of bringing people back from the brink of death .
i know well how provoked you will be , -- and it will all come of love for me . but you can not but own that i am right , if you have any justice in you . write to me and tell me that i am right , only that mr. [male] is your great friend . and that , therefore , just at first , walter will not be your friend . i would tell you more about him .
the news was true , the life -- the one fragile life . that had been used as a measuring tape of time by law . was in danger of being frayed away , it was the last of a group of lives which had served this purpose . at the end of whose breathings the small homestead occupied by south himself . the larger one of [male] , and half a dozen others that had been in the possession of various hintock village families for the previous hundred years .
he did not answer , and she repeated the question . looking up into his face like a criminal waiting for his sentence . her head bent forward and her mouth open . we can not , he muttered , god help us . we dare not , he said ; and then he tried to show her again how their marriage was impossible .
they came into the open part of the park presently . and she was fain to confess , that whatever changes had been made -- and the alterations here were not many . had been made with a perfect appreciation of the picturesque , even the supreme neatness with which the grounds were now kept did not mar their beauty . fairy like young plantations of rare specimens of the coniferous tribe had arisen at every available point of the landscape . wherever there had been barrenness before , here and there the old timber had been thinned a little , always judiciously .
all extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes dazzle . sometimes illuminate us , [male] despairing glance fell on the street lantern post of the blind alley genrot . at that epoch there were no gas jets in the streets of [location] . at nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted ; they were ascended and descended by means of a rope . which traversed the street from side to side , and was adjusted in a groove of the post .
during the display the rest of the horizon glowed with broad bands of pink . and blue , and pale green , and yellow . a little later , when the sun was quite down , in the background of the curdled clouds smouldered a wine red mass of colour . that faded to bronze and tinged all the fading greens with its sanguinary hue , the clouds themselves flushed to rose of all shades . while a fan of gigantic streamers of pale rose radiated toward the zenith .
that was all she said on the matter , if tess had been artful . had she made a scene , fainted , wept hysterically , in that lonely lane . notwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness with which he was possessed . he would probably not have withstood her . but her mood of long suffering made his way easy for him .
at the foot of the steps they met a policeman . to whom they told their story , and who , as a matter of course . was filled with an immediate desire to arrest them both , to the policeman 's mind it was most distressing that a bloody faced man without a hat . with a companion almost too weak to walk , should not be conveyed to a police station . but after ten minutes parley , during which wharton sat on the bottom step and lopez explained all the circumstances .
he was silent , she believed he was looking at her . probably reflecting on what she had said , and trying to understand the manner , she heard him sigh . it was natural for him to feel that he had cause to sigh . he could not believe her to be encouraging him . a few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said .
the way had not seemed so long before , alessandro had been with her . it was a joyous , bright day , and they had lingered wherever they liked . and yet the way had seemed short , fear seized her that she was lost . if that were so , before morning she would be with alessandro . for fierce beasts roamed san [female] by night .
there was only one way of treating the situation , at the end of five minutes [male] departed in search of mr. [male] and mr . [male] , vanquished by the [female] square . she addressed herself to the drivers . who were sprawling in the carriages , perfuming the cushions with cigars . the miscreant , a bony young man scorched [male] by the sun .
they had lived royally these last three months , the agent of the council had had a couple of the best rooms in the inn that looked on to the market square . where he entertained his friends , and now and then a magistrate or two . even mr. [male] , of matstead , had come to him once there . with another , but had refused to stay to supper , and had ridden away again alone . on this last night they made very [male] indeed .
then fared sir [male] further afield , glad exceedingly that he had escaped the foul plots of the four witch queens . and also that he had vanquished the evil sir turquine . then he rode a great while in a deep and dark forest . and as he followed the winding ways . suddenly he saw a [male] hound before him .
the younger emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the battle and . in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers . at twelve o'clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the vanguard . before he came up with the hussars , several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action . this battle , which consisted in the capture of a french squadron .
the porter had received nothing , but i still hoped in my servant . he had seen no one since i went out , if marguerite had been going to answer me she would have answered long before . then i began to regret the terms of my letter ; i should have said absolutely nothing . and that would undoubtedly have aroused her suspicions , for , finding that i did not keep my appointment . she would have inquired the reason of my absence .
i sympathise with you perfectly in what you say about loughlinter . it may be right that you should go there and show yourself . so that those who knew the kennedys in [location] should not say that you had not dared to visit the place . but i do not think it possible that you should live there as yet , and why should you do so ? i can not conceive that your presence there should do good , unless you took delight in the place .
it was eleven o'clock before the family were all in bed . and two o'clock next morning was the latest hour for starting with the beehives if they were to be delivered to the retailers in casterbridge before the saturday market began . the way thither lying by bad roads over a distance of between twenty and thirty miles . and the horse and waggon being of the slowest , at half past one mrs durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where tess and all her little brothers and sisters slept . `` the poor man can not go , '' she said to her eldest daughter .
we shall confess everything to them . they will see , understand and forgive , for our gift is greater than our transgression . they will explain it to the council of vocations . and we shall be assigned to the home of the scholars . this has never been done before , but neither has a gift such as ours ever been offered to men .
the marquis 's people were all expected to vote for his candidates . and would soon have ceased to be the marquis 's people had they failed to do so . they were constrained , also in many respects , by the terms of their very short leases . they could not kill a head of game on their farms . they could not sell their own hay off the land .
although the pillar stood upon the hereditary estate of her husband the lady had never visited it . owing to its insulation by this well nigh impracticable ground , the drive to the base of the hill was tedious and jerky . and on reaching it she alighted , directing that the carriage should be driven back empty over the clods . to wait for her on the nearest edge of the field , she then ascended beneath the trees on foot . the column now showed itself as a much more important erection than it had appeared from the road .
he had approached [male] in the early stages of the hunt . and [male] , being in the mood when he would have loaned anything to anybody . yielded the required five pounds without a murmur , but what was five pounds ? the garment of gloom and the intellectual pallor were once more prominent when his lordship repaired to his room to [male] the loud tweeds which . as lord [male] , he was to wear in the first act .
right so came gouvernail unto sir [male] . that was glad of that lady , so this old [organization] name was sir pellounes . and he told of the great tournament that should be at the castle of maidens . and there sir [male] and thirty two knights of his blood had ordained shields of cornwall . and right so there came one unto sir pellounes .
but as they drew nearer he listened in vain for the bark of a dog . and his eyes quested as futilely for a point of light in the wide canopy of gloom . at last , close together , they rounded a curve in the road . and crossed a small bridge with a creek running below , and mckay knew his arm should be able to send a stone to what he was seeking ahead . and then , a minute later , he drew in a great gasping breath of unbelief and horror .
it was now april , and the judges were to come into barchester before the end of the month . what then could be the use of this ecclesiastical inquiry exactly at the same time ? men and women declared that it was a double prosecution . and that a double prosecution for the same offence was a course of action opposed to the feelings and traditions of the country . miss [female] went so far as to say that it was unconstitutional , and [female] walker declared that no human being except mrs. [female] would ever have been guilty of such cruelty .
`` then my father tells a lying story , '' answered the girl . blushing crimson with indignation ; `` and it is not for want o '' knowing the truth , he knows that , if it was put upon me to choose between your house and the union . i would go to the union -- and with a light heart too . to be free of you , i did not want to be rude , mr. [male] .
no one could say with any degree of certainty what it was that geoffrey brent did for . or knew about , his ducal master ; but it was sufficiently important to gain for him a grant of lands . which he had no more right to occupy than the norman had to bestow , miss brent had made up her mind upon two points . one that she would call upon lady meyfield , the other that patricia 's engagement must be announced . [female] told her all she wanted to know about the bowens .
he was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that he positively pictured to himself first the family . and only secondarily the woman who would give him a family . his ideas of marriage were , consequently , quite unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintances . for whom getting married was one of the numerous facts of social life , for levin it was the chief affair of life . on which its whole happiness turned , and now he had to give up that .
was she really the sort of girl who might be taken for an inveterate old maid ? her hands and feet were small , her ankles well shaped , her figure had been praised . even by women , her hair was a natural red auburn . her features regular , her mouth mobile . well shaped with very red lips , her eyes a violet blue with long dark lashes and eyebrows .
never was promised bride more welcome to a household than bright [female] lawford . and as for the young lady herself , i must confess that she was almost childishly happy . and that it was all that she could do to prevent her light step from falling into a dance as she floated hither and thither through the house at dangerfield . a fresh young hebe in crisp muslin robes . a gentle goddess , with smiles upon her face and happiness in her heart .
there is a peacemaker whose name is death . poor little sylvia , she was unforgiving , but not obdurate to the full extent of what [female] believed . many a time since [female] went away had she unconsciously missed his protecting love . when folks spoke shortly to her , when [female] scolded her as one of the non elect . when [female] 's gentle gravity had something of severity in it .
mrs marsham was all smiles and forgiveness . and hoped that lady [female] would not make a stranger of her , then dinner was announced . and [female] had to walk down stairs by herself . she did not care a doit for that , but there had been a disagreeable little contest when the moment came . lady [male] had wished to give up mr [male] to her [male] .
the sharpness of its turnings was favourable or unfavourable , according to the nature of the prevailing wind . sometimes it broke the swell and caused it to fall . sometimes it exasperated it , this latter effect was the most frequent . an obstacle arouses the anger of the sea . and pushes it to excesses , the foam is the exaggeration of the waves .
i will inform the bishop himself . this marriage would be a sacrilege , i did , this morning . but since my last talk with you i have reconsidered , i have telephoned my acceptance , bully , great ! why , now you are fixed for life , only one kind of fitness encouraged , ', eh ? ... right always triumphs in the end , never lose your faith again , [male] .
how , then , could [male] divine what was going on in [male] 's breast ? for their behavior to each other scandalized no observer -- not even the foreign maid . warranted against sea sickness ; nor [male] 's own experienced valet . still less the picturesque crew , who regarded them as a model couple in high life . their companionship consisted chiefly in a well bred silence .
it would be entering again into a world which he had only quitted in a passion for isolation . induced by a fit of achillean moodiness after an imagined slight . his wife herself saw the awkwardness of their position here . and cheerfully welcomed the purposed change , towards which every step had been taken but the last . but could he find it in his heart .
it was now near the end of may , but she had not been half an hour at the inn before she was loud in demanding a fire . and when the fire came she was unwilling to leave it . her gesture was magnificent when lady ongar proposed to her that she should bathe . what -- put her own dear little dry body , by her own will , into the cold sea ! she shrugged herself , and shook herself .
went down to give a mother 's care , in the fulness of time . to [male] 's neglected children no less than to their own , and to leave that lady going into society for ever and a day . went down to give a tender nurse and friend to tip for some few years . who was never vexed by the great exactions he made of her in return for the riches he might have given her if he had ever had them . and who lovingly closed his eyes upon the marshalsea and all its blighted fruits .
the change in her startled them , hitherto they had always looked on her as rather an unusually quiet girl . she had always made herself unobtrusively [female] to them all . they all liked her , but they had never suspected her of possessing this militant quality . nobody spoke , but there was a general stir , she had flung a new idea broadcast . and it was beginning to take root , do something ?
`` god save the king , '' was the cry in every direction . the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window . looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed ; at which the cries of the multitude were renewed . just as the court was settling down in the cathedral , a carriage . bearing the arms of comminges , quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe .
beverly gasped , the countess stared blankly at the new guard , yetive flushed deeply . bit her lip in hopeless chagrin , and dropped her eyes . a pretty turn , indeed , the play had taken , not a word was uttered for a full half minute . nor did the guilty witnesses venture forth from their retreat . baldos stood tall and impassive , holding the curtain aside , at last the shadow of a smile crept into the face of the princess .
he gravely bade me good night . and i followed him to the outer door and watched his departing figure . lighted by a single candle that he had produced from his pocket . i stood for several minutes listening to his step , tracing it through the hall below—as far as my knowledge of the house would permit . then , in unknown regions , i could hear the closing of doors and drawing of bolts .
he controlled himself , and took it well . so far as outward appearance went : but soon he made an excuse to escape . and presently i saw him strolling off alone , head down , hands in pockets . luncheon was being prepared on the veranda of a house belonging to the chief engineer of the dam . its owner was a friend of sir [male] .
now , as nothing very long abides , it can not be expected that a woman 's anger should last very long . if she be at all of the proper sort , and my mother . being one of the very best , could not long retain her wrath against the squire faggus especially when she came to reflect . upon annie 's suggestion , how natural , and one might say , how inevitable it was that a young man fond of adventure and change and winning good profits by jeopardy . should not settle down without some regrets to a fixed abode and a life of sameness .
mrs [female] and the girls . when this very sudden proposition was made to them , all remained fixed in their place . and , for a moment , were speechless , go and stay a week at guestwick manor ! the whole family , hitherto the intercourse between the manor and [organization] had been confined to morning calls . very far between , mrs [female] had never dined there , and had latterly even deputed the calling to her daughters .
for an instant [male] 's fingers gripped his hand . and he bowed low again like a courtier , [male] saw that he . too , wore the same big , old-fashioned cuffs , and that it was not a knife that hung at his belt . but a short rapier , the girl had taken a step back . and now she swept him a courtesy so low that her fallen hair streamed over her shoulders .
it was a rather pretty little picture , for the sisters sat together in the shady nook . with sun and shadow flickering over them . the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks . and all the little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends . meg sat upon her cushion , sewing daintily with her white hands .
during this time the duke was at the castle . but he showed himself seldom to his guests . so acting , as the reader will i hope understand . from no sense of the importance of his own personal presence . but influenced by a conviction that a public man should not waste his time .
up and up they picked their way , over and between ragged upheavals of rock . twisting into this broken path and that , feeling their way , partly sensing it . and always ascending toward the stars , [male] did not speak again to [male] . each time he came out where the sky was clear he looked toward the solitary dark [organization] . far up and ahead , strangely resembling a giant tombstone in the star glow , that was their guide .
[female] , hit you , you infamous creature . how dare you accuse me of such a thing ? it is you who have hit me . you have wounded me to the heart . eliza smiles for the first time .
the night -- its silence -- its rest . was rent in twain by a savage . a sharp , a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of thornfield hall . my pulse stopped : my heart stood still ; my stretched arm was paralysed . the cry died , and was not renewed , indeed , whatever being uttered that fearful shriek could not soon repeat it .
it was not her husband , she had said . yet a consciousness that in a physical sense this man alone was her husband seemed to weigh on her more and more . during the small hours of the next morning , while it was still dark . dwellers near the highways were conscious of a disturbance of their night 's rest by rumbling noises . intermittently continuing till daylight -- noises as certain to recur in this particular first week of the month as the voice of the cuckoo in the third week of the same .
[female] then took out of her pillow case a complete petticoat of some rich stuff . and a green mantle of some other fine material , and a necklace and other ornaments out of a little box . and with these in an instant she so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich lady . all this , and more , she said , she had taken from home in case of need . but that until then she had had no occasion to make use of it .
i occupied the interval day at the farm in writing a plain narrative of the conspiracy . and in adding to it a statement of the practical contradiction which facts offered to the assertion of [male] 's death . this i submitted to mr. [male] before i read it the next day to the assembled tenants . we also arranged the form in which the evidence should be presented at the close of the reading . after these matters were settled , mr. [male] endeavoured to turn the conversation next to [male] 's affairs .
the man , having spied out the land in his two visits to lady wetherby 's house . was now about to break in , his accomplice would stand by with the sack . with a beating heart mr pickering gripped his revolver and moved round in the shadow of the shrubbery till he came to the gate . when he was just in time to see the guilty couple disappear into the woods . he followed them , he was glad to get on the move again .
i may say now , now that i know it was not your choice . what a void these last few days the lack of letters has been to me . i wondered , truly , if you had found it well to put off such visible signs for a while in order to appease one who . in other things more essential , sees you rebellious , but the wonder is over now . and i do not want you to write -- not till a consultation of doctors orders it for the good of your health .
the boats were hastily prepared , and the men worked with a will to batten down every loophole whence the fire might escape . soon the poor [female] was a floating furnace , and the order to `` take to the boats ! '' came for all , the women first , of course , and it was fortunate that . being a merchantman , there were no more passengers on board . so there was no panic , and one after the other the boats pushed off .
my first impulse was to call up [male] , and show him the two men going away . but reflecting , before i got into his room , which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine . that he and startop had had a harder day than i . and were fatigued , i forbore , going back to my window , i could see the two men moving over the marsh . in that light , however , i soon lost them , and , feeling very cold .
past the big pine , swerving with a smile his horse aside that he might not obliterate the foot print in the [male] earth . and down the mountain , his brain busy with his big purpose . went [male] , by instinct , inheritance , blood and tradition , pioneer . one of his forefathers had been with [location] on the father 's first historic expedition into the wilds of [location] . his great-grandfather had accompanied boone when that hunter first penetrated the `` dark and bloody ground , ''
the maltese cockney had been a most capable master of ceremonies with the first one . more than anything else , i think , was i hardened against these brutes by what i saw them do . in the end , the maltreated fish thrashed about the deck entirely eviscerated . nothing remained but the mere flesh shell of the creature . yet it would not die , it was amazing the life that lingered when all the vital organs were gone .
[male] manners were very much admired at the parsonage . and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings . it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither . for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary . and it was not till easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen 's arrival .
on the landing they were no longer fighting , but amused themselves with stories about women . and in the antechamber , with stories about the court . on the landing [male] blushed ; in the antechamber he trembled . his warm and fickle imagination , which in [location] had rendered formidable to young chambermaids . and even sometimes their mistresses , had never dreamed , even in moments of delirium .
yes ; that was the same face , the same pent house of ragged eyebrow over the cold and snaky eye beneath . the same wolfish mouth and permanent hungry smile . but he looked better , stouter , stronger ; more cheerful , it seemed as if my lady 's society had done him a world of good . and acted as a kind of elixir of life . i observed [male] , as he came in her eyes dropped .
she told me afterwards . very briefly -- how ill she had been , she had wanted to come before . but could not ; as it was , she had left pest by stealth . and had come with a passport made out under a false name , she had suffered much on the way . she had gone astray in the snowstorm in the beech woods .
[female] heaved a last sigh , climbed with difficulty into his carriage . so great was his weakness , and went to the castle , escorted by [male] . whose politeness was not less terrifying this time than it had just before been consoling and cheerful . as [male] was alighting from his carriage , to enter the castle of nantes . a man of mean appearance went up to him with marks of the greatest respect .
the dignified person had then retreated downstairs slowly , and what was taking place for the next half hour poor mrs mackenzie . in the agony of her mind , could not surmise , she longed to go and see . but did not dare , even for dr slumpy , or even for his wife . had they been alone with her she would not have cared much , [female] colza she could have treated with perfect indifference . could even have taken her down into the kitchen with her , [female] , her own junior partner .
more than once , a society has been seen to give way before the wind which is let loose upon mankind . history is full of the shipwrecks of nations and empires . manners , customs , laws , religions . and some fine day that unknown force , the hurricane . passes by and bears them all away , the civilizations of [location] .
it appeared that [female] , who was a precise as well as an ardent young man . had had scruples about trusting to hearsay , certainly it was rumoured far and wide that the squire of matstead had done as he had said he would do . and gone to church ; but mr. [male] was one of those spirits who will always have things . as they say , from the fountain head ; partly from instincts of justice . partly , no doubt , for the pleasure of making direct observations to the principals concerned .
everybody 's feelings were consulted , if tenderness could be ever supposed wanting . good sense and good breeding supplied its place . and as to the little irritations sometimes introduced by aunt norris . they were short , they were trifling , they were as a drop of water to the ocean . compared with the ceaseless tumult of her present abode .
when nicolete heard aucassin , right so came she unto him . for she was not far away , she passed within the lodge . and threw her arms about his neck , and clipped and kissed him . so either kissed and clipped the other , and fair joy was them between , right so felt she his shoulder and found it was wried from its place . and she so handled it with her white hands .
his father , president of [organization] of that town . had displayed so much energy in his office that the place had become too hot to hold the son when the parent . a pettifogging lawyer , perished on the scaffold after the ninth thermidor . on the death of his mother , who died of the grief this catastrophe occasioned . jean sold all that he possessed and rushed to [location] at the age of twenty two .
the red evening flame had vanished from the summits of the trees . the sun was setting , the woods in shadow . when i got to the end of my walk . i did not approach the house on the side of the door . yet by some means those within became aware of my presence , for out they came in a great hurry .
lady scatcherd , holding a vast counterpane in her arms . looked back over her shoulders and perceived that [female] was in the room . down went the counterpane on the ground , and [male] soon found himself in the very position which that useful article had so lately filled , oh , master [female] ! oh , master [female] , said her ladyship , almost in an hysterical fit of joy . and then she hugged and kissed him as she had never kissed and hugged her own son since that son had first left the parent nest .
[male] , [male] , and the tutor did not care for that location . but [male] and mr. [male] wanted to erect a tent and take provisions and their instruments and live among the dim coolness . where miracles of song burst on the air at any moment . they heard and identified the veery , they went on their knees at their first experience with the clear . [organization] notes of the wood thrush .
in 1806 pfuel had been one of those responsible , for the plan of campaign that ended in jena and auerstadt . but he did not see the least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war . on the contrary , the deviations made from his theory were , in his opinion . the sole cause of the whole disaster , and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark . `` there , i said the whole affair would go to the devil ! ''
i cleared that kitchen and the pantry adjoining . it was ten o'clock when i got through , and [male] had gone to bed without deigning further speech . i locked mr. [male] in one room and [male] in another and went to bed , too . i had never felt so dead tired in my life before , it had been a hard day . but i got up bright and early the next morning and got a tiptop breakfast .
the pair played the scene well together , stimulated , perhaps , by their very nervousness at finding themselves before so imposing an audience . polichinelle was everything that is fierce , contemptuous , and insistent . columbine was the essence of pert indifference under his cajolery . saucily mocking under his threats , and finely sly in extorting the very maximum when it came to accepting a bribe . laughter rippled through the audience and promised well , but [male] binet .
`` does not she look weird , '' [female] heard some girls titter behind her . and she could have killed them , `` how do you do ! '' sang [female] , coming up very kindly , and glancing slowly over [female] 's father and mother . it was a trying moment , exasperating for [female] . [female] was really so strongly entrenched in her class superiority .
phoebe marks was sitting at the foot of the bed . with her eyes fixed upon her husband 's face . not with any very tender expression in the pale light . but with a sharp , terrified anxiety , which showed that it was the coming of death itself that she dreaded . rather than the loss of her husband , the old woman was busy at the fire place .
i am almost afraid to confess it , even to these secret pages . the man has interested me , has attracted me . has forced me to like him , in two short days he has made his way straight into my favourable estimation . and how he has worked the miracle is more than i can tell . it absolutely startles me , now he is in my mind .
`` forward , '' said hadden , and leaving most of the men to cut up the heifer and carry the best of her meat to camp . they started on the blood spoor . for some hours they followed the bull . till at last they lost the trail on a patch of stony ground thickly covered with [female] . and exhausted by the heat , sat down to rest and to eat some biltong or sun dried flesh which they had with them .
in the church there was no one but the peasants . the servants and their women folk , but darya alexandrovna saw . or fancied she saw , the sensation produced by her children and her . the children were not only beautiful to look at in their smart little dresses , but they were charming in the way they behaved . aliosha , it is true , did not stand quite correctly ; he kept turning round .
i say `` once , '' for now duty , truth , and honor bar [male] from each other . my life must be solitary , yet i shall find work to do , and learn to be content . you owe all devotion to the good old man who loves you . and will not fail him , i am sure , leave the future and the past . but let [male] make the present what it may be -- a time to forgive and forget .
when [female] fell into this echo mood i always found it best to fall into taciturnity . next day , the rain poured down incessantly , sweeping blindingly across the hills as i have rarely seen it sweep except at enderley . the weather had apparently broken up , even thus early in the autumn ; and for that day . and several days following , we had nothing but wind . rain , and storm , the sky was as dusky as miss march 's grey gown .
but he could not go away , she would repent : she would write to summon him to another meeting beneath the bare old oak . with an imagination as ardent as her own , he could picture that meeting . he could almost hear her voice as he fancied the things she would say . `` my love , my love , '' she would cry . clasping those slender hands about his arm ; i can not live without you .
ay , says i , if it had not been for that unlucky throw . i had got you a hundred guineas . so i gave him all the money , but he would not take it till i had put my hand into it . and taken some for myself , and bid me please myself . i refused it , and was positive i would not take it myself .
[female] dieu , [female] dieu ! she muttered , and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead . `` good night , lise , '' said he . rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger . the friends were silent , neither cared to begin talking , [male] continually glanced at prince [male] .
they are keen on all games , presently he started sneezing and had to stop . then i hear more clicketing , and it is mr. [male] practising . and then , a tissue , a tissue ' : he has to stop too . then evie comes out , and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a greengage tree . they put everything to use -- and then she says `` a tissue , ''
he had a ready appreciation of art . and probably , with a taste for imitating art , he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for an artist . and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to select -- religious , historical , realistic . or genre painting -- he set to work to paint , he appreciated all kinds . and could have felt inspired by any one of them ; but he had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting .
sir [male] , in answer to the doctor 's inquiries . had declared himself to be all right ; but his appearance was anything but all right . twelve months since , a life of dissipation . or rather , perhaps , a life of drinking , had not had upon him so strong an effect but that some of the salt of youth was still left . some of the freshness of young years might still be seen in his face .
he was toiling on with this longing at his heart when he saw that he was drawing near a stately city . with a great old cathedral in the centre keeping solemn guard . this place might be yet two or three miles distant ; he was on a rising ground looking down upon it . a labouring man passing by , observed his pallid looks and his languid attitude . and told him for his comfort , that if he turned down a lane to the left a few steps farther on .
[male] piloted jocelyn , who was still in a good humour . to his bedroom door , then she went to bed herself and slept as well as ever . jocelyn , alone in his room , called for another bottle of whiskey and made a night of it . to be exact he made three days of it . four less than might reasonably have been expected , for [male] to have taken him back to roscarna was out of the question .
the first faint lines of light came into the eastern sky . [female] stood by the window . watching the colour come on the grey above the hill . while two or three stars still shone dimly , the night lamp flickered . then went out , she set it in the hall and came back to the window .
the year 1921 , it will be remembered , was a trying one for the inhabitants of [location] . every boat that arrived from england brought a fresh swarm of british lecturers to the country . novelists , poets , scientists , philosophers . and plain , ordinary bores ; some herd instinct seemed to affect them all simultaneously . it was like one of those great race movements of the middle ages .
`` now , ranald , '' she said , noting the effect of her words upon him . `` what is it to be ? '' `` i will go back , '' he said , simply . and turning with a single word of farewell , he sprang over the fence and disappeared in the woods . the minister 's wife stood looking the way he went long after he had passed out of sight . and then , lifting her eyes to the radiant sky with its shining lights .
who were in need of him possibly , who were a mere handful against an army ! should he be untrue at once to his love , to country . to his word ? should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism ? but this was impossible , and if the phantom of his father was there in the gloom . and beheld him retreating , he would beat him on the loins with the flat of his sword .
this confirmed me in my belief that i had guessed right , `` dubourg '' is as common a name in my country as [male] or [male] is in england -- just the sort of feigned name that a man in difficulties would give among us. was he a criminal countryman of mine , no ! there had been nothing foreign in his accent when he spoke . pure english -- there could be no doubt of that , and yet he had given a french name .
a rustling in the long path made [male] turn . some one was coming , it was margot lorenzi , he could not believe that it was really she . and stared stupidly , thinking the figure he saw an optical illusion . she had on a grey travelling dress . and a grey hat trimmed with [female] ribbon .
dr , [male] , being the only available bachelor . did duty as best man ; [male] having stipulated that he should not be intrusted with the ring . her previous observations leading her to conclude that he would most probably slip it unconsciously on to his finger . and then search through all his own pockets and all [male] 's ; and begin taking up the church matting . before it occurred to him to look at his hand .
she and the stars , visible beside her . were no strangers where all else was strange : my childhood knew them . i had seen that golden sign with the dark globe in its curve leaning back on azure . beside an old thorn at the top of an old field . in old england , in long past days , just as it now leaned back beside a stately spire in this continental capital .
i have paid a visit to the heights . but i have not seen her since she left : [female] held the door in his hand when i called to ask after her . and would not let me pass , he said mrs. [female] was `` thrang , '' and the master was not in , zillah has told me something of the way they go on . otherwise i should hardly know who was dead and who living , she thinks [female] haughty .
she was obedient to his will in all things , providing for his comfort with scrupulous regularity . industrious , indefatigable even , as a housekeeper and partner of his fortunes . no man could have desired a better wife , yet dimly , in that sluggish soul . there was the consciousness that he had married a woman who hated him . that he had bought her with a price .
he tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers of assistance . he avoided all distraction and recreation . and even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother . pace silently up and down the room , and smoke one pipe after another . he seemed carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure his position .
what an air of confirmation to all these rumors did it give . when the evening papers announced in the most striking type . resignation of sir [male] . if the terms in which he communicated that step to the premier were not before the world . the date , the very night of the debate .
few things could have been more to their liking than to give him a tow over the side . for to the forecastle he had sent messes and concoctions of the vilest order . conditions favoured the undertaking , the ghost was slipping through the water at no more than three miles an hour . and the sea was fairly calm , but [organization] had little stomach for a dip in it . possibly he had seen men towed before , besides , the water was frightfully cold .
friends who meant to say something very generous of [male] were wont to observe . that he was not such a fool as he looked . nor , in the ordinary attributes of a country gentleman . was the master of [male] castle behind his compeers . he rode like [male] , never missed his bird in the open .
the hour drew near to noon and the sky lightened and a rift of deep blue stretched across the open space before him . lazily he speculated as to how he was to get his provisions brought up to him . and when and how he might get his mail , but laughed to think how little he cared for a hundred and one things which had filled his life and dogged his days ere this . had he reached nirvana ? nay , he could still hunger and thirst . a footstep was heard without , and a figure appeared in his doorway .
the man , certainly , was one strangely endowed with the power of creating a belief . when going to mr. [male] at his chambers he had not intended to cheat the lawyer into any erroneous idea about his family . but he had resolved that he would so discuss the questions of his own condition . which would probably be raised , as to leave upon the old man 's mind an unfounded conviction that in regard to money and income he had no reason to fear question . not a word had been said about his money or his income .
mr [male] 's complaint . society and he had so much to do with one another in all things else . that it is hard to imagine his complaint , if he had one . being solely his own affair , had he that deep seated recondite complaint . and did any doctor find it out ? patience , in the meantime .
they passed bits of common with cows and a stray horse . also a little rural cemetery ; but [location] suddenly began again parish after parish , the same blue roofs . the same tenement houses , the train had passed the first cedar and the first tennis lawn . and knowing it to be a derby excursion the players paused in their play and looked up . again the line was blocked ; the train stopped again and again , but it had left [location] behind .
he was sure she would , after that swift glance of his . and -- well , what a happy man he would be for whom this tender young marguerite would suffer or be sacrificed . the idea had really never occurred to him before that [male] was nearly a woman . but it occurred to him now with all the greater force . because he had been so oblivious to the fact before , bright as the future was .
the doctor had been summoned , and the cure , the doctor had arrived too late . the son had also arrived too late , by the dim light of the candle . a large tear could be distinguished on the pale and prostrate colonel 's cheek . where it had trickled from his dead eye , the eye was extinguished . but the tear was not yet dry , that tear was his son 's delay .
if he had been a woman he must have screamed under the nervous tension which he was now undergoing . but that relief being denied to his virility , he clenched his teeth in misery . bringing lines about his mouth like those in the laocoön . and corrugations between his brows , a mournful wind blew through the trees . and sounded in the chimney like the pedal notes of an organ .
resolutely she closed her door . and dressed her baby carefully ; then she arrayed herself in the soft silk gown . and the wide hat with the heavy plume , and then -- could [female] have seen her with her courageous eyes and lifted head . and the faint color from excitement in her cheeks . he would no longer have feared to take her by the hand and lead her to his mother and say .
[female] bent low over the fire and stirred the coal between the bars with a poker . [location] 's mention of [female] had roused within her an almost irresistible desire to explain to her the true state of the case between herself and [female] . she knew , from the tone of her voice . that in speaking of [female] she had no desire to probe [female] 's secrets . or to insinuate any of her own , moreover , she liked [location] .
and again she hurried on in front , to warn him of the steps . and at the gate , once more she stood on the step whilst he stood below her . she suffered torments hearing his firm tread going so distinctly down the road . ah , the insensitiveness of that firm tread ! she closed the gate , and crept quickly and noiselessly back to bed .
it is not to be supposed that clarissa could be so much away from home without attracting the attention of miss granger . whether that young lady was at home or abroad , she contrived to keep herself always well informed as to the movements of her stepmother . she speculated , and wondered , and puzzled herself a good deal about these frequent outings . and finding clarissa singularly reticent upon the subject , grew daily more curious and suspicious . until at last she could endure the burden of this perplexity no longer .
as soldiers they went up against the riders of mekh . and as soldiers they held them until they died . those that were left were borne back into the square , caught as in the crest of an avalanche . and first through the gates came the winged battle mask of the lord ciaran . and the sable axe that drank men 's lives where it hewed .
it was through such a depression as this that he labored during three weeks . while no summons and no hint of remembrance came from chilcote . his position was peculiarly difficult , he found no action in the present . and towards the future he dared not trust himself to look . he had slipped the old moorings that familiarity had rendered endurable .
the next instant he was staring , the girl had entered and closed the door behind her . o'connor 's picture stood in flesh and blood before him . the girl 's eyes met his own , they were like glorious violets . as o'connor had said , but they were not the eyes he had expected to see . they were the wide-open , curious eyes of a child .
love is what tempts a man to tell foolish lies to a woman and a woman to tell the fool truth to a man . it took seven hundred guesses for [male] to find out what kind of a wife he wanted . and even then he seems to have had his doubts , the only thing more astonishing than the length of time a man 's love will subsist on nothing is the celerity with which it is surfeited the moment it has any encouragement to feed on . even when a man knows that he wants to marry a woman . she has to prove it to him with a diagram before he is really convinced of it .
it was not temporal , her hatred , she did not hate him for this or for that . she did not want to do anything to him . to have any connection with him , her relation was ultimate and utterly beyond words . the hate was so pure and gemlike , it was as if he were a beam of essential enmity . a beam of light that did not only destroy her .
he kisses his hand to you . he takes you for my wife , ah ! the [male] has come too soon for that younker , poor old sir [female] ! how do you like bath , miss elliot ? it suits [female] very well .
he had resigned to his juniors , with pathetic expressions of regret . the making of love and the fighting of duels . ravaged by past passions , this dear innocent had now found a refuge from swords . pistols , and the sex , in collecting butterflies and playing on the guitar . i was free wholly to devote myself to lucilla ; and i honestly rejoiced in the prospect before me .
he sat up very late , alternately reading the report and looking at the picture . it was unfortunate that [female] had smiled into the camera . coupled with her blowing hair it had given her a light heartedness . a sort of joyousness , that hurt him to the soul . in the little house of mercy two weeks went by , and then a third .
i had an idea that the well had sprung a leak . that some of the wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that allowed the water to escape . i measured the chain -- 98 feet . then i called in a couple of monks . locked the door , took a candle , and made them lower me in the bucket .
he turned his head and met fraide 's glance . `` do not count too much on me , sir , '' he said , slowly . `` i might disappoint you again , '' his voice broke off on the last word . for the sound of other voices and of laughter came to them across the terrace as a group of two women and three men passed through the open door . at a glance he realized that the slighter of the two women was eve .
from this remark of [female] 's the reader will understand that she was well aware of the part her sister was playing . and she was perfectly satisfied that it should be so , for by this means she occasionally got a [female] word from [female] . she , however , often wished that mr. [male] could be constantly with her sister . for his presence in the house did not prevent her from expending her wrath upon both [female] and the blacks . from that time she was dearer to him than ever and [male] .
scrap looked up at the pine tree motionless among stars . beauty made you love , and love made you beautiful. . she pulled her wrap closer round her with a gesture of defence . of keeping out and off , she did not want to grow sentimental , difficult not to , here . the marvelous night stole in through all one 's chinks .
while we had been trying our experiment with lucilla . the weather had brightened again , the clouds were parting ; the sun was coming out . the bright gaps of blue in the sky were widening every moment . the shadows were traveling grandly over the windy slopes of the hills . lucilla lifted her hands in speechless admiration as the german threw open the window .
i wonder what you will say to my news ? but you must not scold me . pray do not scold me , it could never , never have been as you wanted . i have engaged myself to marry my [male] . captain walter marrable , who is a nephew of sir gregory marrable , and a son of colonel marrable . we shall be very poor , having not more than £300 a year above his pay as a captain .
it is a sin to write this , it is a sin to think words no others think and to put them down upon a paper no others are to see . it is base and evil , it is as if we were speaking alone to no ears but our own . and we know well that there is no transgression blacker than to do or think alone . we have broken the laws , the laws say that men may not write unless the council of vocations bid them so . may we be forgiven , but this is not the only sin upon us .
had i then misunderstood him ? could it be that his outstretched hands had really been directed towards my feet ? yet , surely , even amulya had seen the passion that flamed out of his eyes , his face . but sandip is such an adept in setting music to his chant of praise that i can not argue . i lose my power of seeing truth . my sight is clouded over like an opium eater 's eyes .
aunt [male] never really sees him , and thus never recognises him when he appears again . always as the flower of chivalry and guardian of ladies in distress . i will never again travel abroad without a man , even if i have to hire one from a feeble minded asylum . we work like galley slaves , aunt [male] and i . finding out about trains and things , neither of [male] can understand bradshaw .
these influences were visible in the temperate warmth of westy 's manner . and in his way of keeping a backward eye on the mute interchange of comment about the chess board . at another time his embarrassment would have amused [female] . but the feelings stirred by her talk with [female] had not subsided . and she recognized with a sting of mortification the resemblance between her view of the lynbrook set and its estimate of herself .
good mrs. [female] ( always the first of the party to sit down ) . took possession of an arm chair in a corner . and dozed off comfortably to sleep , at my request miss [female] placed herself at the piano . as i followed her to a seat near the instrument . i saw miss [female] retire into a recess of one of the side windows .
now how could we look into it , without watching [male] . whenever he went abroad , and trying to catch him in his speech . when he was taking his ease at night . for , in spite of all the disgust with which he had spoken of harvest wassailing . there was not a man coming into our kitchen who liked it better than he did .
so saying , she fell to tidying the room , removing as much as she could every vestige of sickness . making up the fire , and setting on the kettle for a cup of tea for her sister in law . whose low moans and sobs were occasionally heard in the room below . [female] helped her in all these little offices , they were busy in this way when the door was softly opened . and [male] came in , all grimed and dirty from his night work .
the curtain rose , [female] saw the stage mistily . from childhood up , she had never been able to cure herself of an unfortunate sensitiveness when sharply spoken to by those she loved . a rebuking world she could face with a stout heart . but there had always been just one or two people whose lightest word of censure could crush her . her father had always had that effect upon her , and now derek had taken his place .
but it was no longer the same pale , spiritless countenance they had beheld when he left them . from pale he had become livid ; and from spiritless , annihilated . a breathing , living specter , he advanced with his arms stretched out . his mouth parched , like a shade that comes to salute the friends of former days . on seeing him thus , every one cried out , and every one rushed towards [male] .
it was with a sense of luxury that he recognized his power of viewing life here from its inner side . in a way that had been quite foreign to him in his student days ; and , much as he loved his parents . he could not help being aware that to come here , as now , after an experience of home life . affected him like throwing off splints and bandages . even the one customary curb on the humours of english rural societies being absent in this place .
the group came nearer , halted , allard drew himself stiffly erect and raised his hand in salute as the tallest man came opposite . then obeyed a slight movement of direction and stepped behind him . a grating of locks , a brief exchange of compliments . and for the first time in two years the prisoner stood without the barriers . free , if only for that instant , free , and in reach of the lapping river .
then the pernicious charm of [location] worked on her . and , instead of acquiring information , she began to be happy , she puzzled out the italian notices . the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the church . the notice that prayed people , in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves . not to spit , she watched the tourists ; their noses were as red as their baedekers .
then mighty mars has not the pluck of a parrot . when left in the dark he will quiver and quail ; and vulcan has arms that would snap like a carrot . before he could drive in a tenpenny nail , then [female] 's [female] are very repelling . and [female] should not have a quint in her eyes . the learned [female] is weak in her spelling , and scatters her h 's all over the skies .
before i could hope to make any further progress in that direction . i realised that i needed to know more of the family . of its history and social standing , besides , i must be armed cap à pie before i went to that interview which i had determined to seek . in the morning , with [male] , `` beg pardon , sir , '' said a voice at my elbow , and looking up , i saw the hotel clerk standing there .
mr. [male] could not resist the pleasure of corresponding with will and [male] . and one morning when his pen had been remarkably fluent on the prospects of municipal reform . it ran off into an invitation to the grange . which , once written , could not be done away with at less cost than the sacrifice of the whole valuable letter . during the months of this correspondence mr. [male] had continually .
it was a great day for young [male] . great because he knew that [male] would be coming to mill ; he would see her and talk with her . perhaps if he were quick enough , he might even lift her from the brown pony . it was a great day , too , because ollie stewart would be saying good by . and before tomorrow would be on his way out of the hills .
three weeks had passed by not unpleasantly when , one morning , i took it into my head to walk by myself across that somewhat sterile savannah west of the village and stream . which ended , as i have said , in a long , low , stony ridge . from the village there was nothing to attract the eye in that direction . but i wished to get a better view of that great solitary hill or mountain of ytaioa . and of the cloud like summits beyond it in the distance .
but my happiness was not unalloyed , it was comparative , a period of less misery slipped in between a past of great miseries and a future of great miseries . for the ghost , so far as the seamen were concerned , was a hell ship of the worst description . they never had a moment 's rest or [male] . [male] treasured against them the attempt on his life and the drubbing he had received in the forecastle . and morning , noon , and night .
there was a scraping of chairs on the floor . and with a sense of release amherst saw that the colloquy in the window was over . the two visitors , gathering their wraps about them . moved slowly across the room , still talking to the matron in excited undertones . through which , as they neared the threshold , the younger woman 's staccato again broke out .
thanis muttered , `` dreams , besides , i am cold , '' she hesitated . and then crept in under balin 's cloak , stark had gone away from her . she watched him sulkily where he leaned upon the stone . he might have been part of it . as dark and unstirring , stark turned his head .
it was a funny glad to see him i felt as i came into the surgery where he was standing over by the window looking out at my garden in its twilight glow . i gave him my hand and a good deal more of a smile and a blush than i intended . he very far from kissed the hand ; he held it just long enough to turn me round into the light and give me one long looking over from head to feet . `` just where does that corset press you worst ? '' he asked in the tone of voice he uses to say `` put out your tongue . '' so much of my bad temper rose to my face that it is a wonder it did not make a scar .
i got your letter directly i came in last night . and i suppose i had better dash at it at once . i would so willingly delay doing so , saying nice little things the while . did i not know that this would be mere cowardice , whatever happens i wo not be a coward . and therefore i will tell you at once that i can not let you hope that we should be married this year .
it seemed like instant , daring suicide in him to stand on that swaying . clattering house as it moved off irresponsibly down the plane of vision . she watched him till he was out of sight . a mere speck on the horizon of the prairie . and then she turned her horse slowly into the road .
[female] now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event . however certain the mind may be told to consider it , and certainty itself . she now found , that in spite of herself . she had always admitted a hope , while [male] remained single . that something would occur to prevent his marrying [male] ; that some resolution of his own .
the change from the bright sunny air out of doors to the deep shadow of this room made him think for the first moment that she had passed on . and that no one was there , and he stood for an instant baffled . and hearing no sound but the beating of his own heart . but an irrepressible sobbing gasp made him look round . and there he saw her cowered behind the door .
though ev'rywhere true love i see a coming to all , but not to me . i can not tell what this love may be , for i am blithe and i am gay . while they sit sighing night and day . for i am blithe and i yes , she is blithe and she is am gay . gay , think of the gulf ` twixt yes .
things at this time so befell me . that i can not tell one half ; but am like a boy who has left his lesson unready . except with false excuses , and as this makes no good work , so i lament upon my lingering . in the times when i might have got through a good page . but went astray after trifles , however , every man must do according to his intellect .
most of them could lie with audacity when it appeared advantageous to do so . all understood the art of speaking fair when a point was to be gained . and could with consummate skill and at a moment 's notice turn the cold shoulder the instant civility ceased to be profitable . very little open quarrelling ever took place amongst them ; but backbiting and talebearing were universal . close friendships were forbidden by the rules of the school .
it is smoothed decorously over the deceased brethren of the convent . and is kept quite free from grass or weeds , such as would grow even in these gloomy recesses . if pains were not bestowed to root them up , but , as the cemetery is small . and it is a precious privilege to sleep in holy ground . the brotherhood are immemorially accustomed , when one of their number dies .
aloud he said , very red , `` oh i say -- i beg your pardon '' and then stood hesitating , and wondering whether he ought not to go back to his bedroom again . if he had said nothing they would not have noticed he was there . but when he begged their pardon rose turned and looked at him as one looks who is trying to remember . and [male] looked at him too without at first quite seeing him .
she clasped his knees , he could not refrain from shaking his head sadly . `` i will bring him to you , '' he said , in a weak voice , then he turned his head and plunged down the staircase with great strides . stifling with sobs , when he reached the place . he no longer saw anything except the handsome horse hitched at the door of the gondelaurier house .
long ago , in her youth , aunt [female] was engaged to a young architect . he , with his triangles and t squares and things . succeeded in making an imaginary scale drawing of her heart ( up to that time a virgin forest . an unmapped territory ) , which enabled him to enter in and set up a pedestal there . on which he has remained ever since , he has been only a memory for many years .
two men led my mother down a steep and gliddery stair way . like the ladder of a hay mow ; and thence from the break of the falling water as far as the house of the captain . and there at the door they left her trembling . strung as she was , to speak her mind . but after a little while , as she said , remembrance of her husband came .
the pilot ate in the chart house . so that at table were the four of [male] that would always be at table together . captain west and his daughter faced each other , while i , on the captain 's right . faced mr. [male] , this put miss west across the corner on my right . on the other hand , captain west 's attitude toward me was that of a social equal .
so , they went softly up the kitchen stairs on tiptoe . and [female] with her light hand softly removed the fastenings of the house door . and [male] , having received a parting hug , made off , when he had gone a little way . he looked back , upon which , [male] set another of those finger seals upon the air . and thrust out her little foot expressive of the mark .
but he had come at last to create a trust for himself out of [male] 's nature . she could do what she resolved to do : and he willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to erect a tomb with his name upon it . ( not that mr. [male] called the future volumes a tomb . he called them the key to all mythologies . ) but the months gained on him and left his plans belated .
his belief in celibacy , so reticent , so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture . now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower , they that marry do well . but they that refrain do better , so ran his belief , and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure . in the case of [male] , the feeling was intensified through dislike of [male] . and he was willing to go further -- to place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity .
he is neither better nor worse , said the lady of the lake . but the noble king [male] himself . god defend , said sir [male] , that ever he should be in such distress . then they rode together a great pace , until they came to a little turret or castle . and underneath that castle they saw a knight standing upon foot fighting with two knights .
on reaching petersburg he inquired for kuragin but the latter had already left the city . [male] had warned his brother in law that prince [male] was on his track . anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the minister of war and went to join the army in [location] . while in petersburg prince [male] met kutuzov . his former commander who was always well disposed toward him , and kutuzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in [location] .
mr. [male] came forward to where the invalid lay , he was a [organization] old man with white hair and a pallid face . which looked almost ghastly in contrast to his [male] velvet skull cap . so far as mr. [male] could see , he appeared to be almost totally paralysed . with the exception of his head , neck , and left arm . which he could still move a little , his [male] eyes .
whereas [male] was , now and forever , for all the world . her hands consecrated to bind up its little wounds and to soothe its great ones . harvey craved a cheap and easy [female] , she wanted no [male] except that bought by service . the [male] of a tired body , the [male] of the little house in [location] where . after days of torture , weary men found quiet and ease and the cheer of the open door .
which was vouchsafed him by a voice at once sweet and serious , the comte was seated at a table covered with papers and books . he was still the noble , handsome gentleman of former days . but time had given to this nobleness and beauty a more solemn and distinct character . a brow white and void of wrinkles , beneath his long hair . now more white than [male] ; an eye piercing and mild .
hardly had he rejected the notion when he had a glimpse of a female figure coming quickly round the corner . a glimpse that sent him walking quickly away , across the road . towards turl street , blushing violently , had she seen him ? he asked himself , and had she seen that he saw her ? he heard her running after him .
nevertheless she stepped up to the porch and listened again , there was no sound within except the ticking of the clock . making a call on her courage , she pushed the door open with the tips of her fingers . it made a rustle as the bottom brushed over the rushes . at that she uttered a faint cry and crept back trembling . but all was silence again in an instant , the fire gave out a strong red glow which spread over the walls and the ceiling .
she then , still greatly perplexed about mr arnott . sought him again , and , after various questions and conjectures . at length brought him to confess he had himself lent his brother the sum with which the hills had been paid . the meanness with which mr harrel had assumed the credit . as well as accepted the assistance of mr arnott .
on leaving [location] , [female] and [female] well knew that they would be encountering great danger . but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger . besides , they felt that the denouement of this second odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make . besides , there was no tranquillity in [location] itself . provisions began to fail , and whenever one of the prince [male] conti 's generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult .
leaving this town of unamused citizens immured in domestic tombs . we got on a fine high road -- still ascending -- with a spacious open country on either side of it . a spacious open country is a country soon exhausted by a sight seer 's eye . i have learnt from my poor pratolungo the habit of searching for the political convictions of my fellow creatures . when i find myself in contact with them in strange places .
it was a robust , round headed , short legged creature , about as big as a good-sized cat . and clothed in a thick , greenish brown fur , the ground all about was covered with creepers . binding the ferns , bushes , and old dead branches together . and in this confused tangle the animal scrambled and tore with a great show of energy . but really made very little progress ; and all at once it flashed into my mind that it was a sloth .
while he was yet but a little way from the court of king [male] . a stranger knight , tall and big . in [male] armour , had ridden into the hall where sat gwenevere the queen . with a few of the younger knights and her women , the page of the chamber was serving the queen with wine in a golden goblet richly wrought . which [male] had taken from a knight whom he had lately slain .
and when attired in rich array , light , lustrous hair about her brow . she yonder sat , a kind of day lit up what seems so gloomy now . these grim oak walls even then were grim ; that old carved chair was then antique . but what around looked dusk and dim served as a foil to her fresh cheek . her neck and arms , of hue so fair .
the little creature had never been so high before , and she was too frightened to move . her master was sunk in despair , he was a little country boy . and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place . where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts . he always felt shy and awkward here , and wanted to hide behind things for fear some one might laugh at him .
`` no , thank you , '' said [female] . dreading , as did all the young people of overcombe , the spectacle of the corporal uncovered . he had never been seen in public without the hat and the handkerchief since his return in ninety four . and strange stories were told of the ghastliness of his appearance bare headed . a little boy who had accidentally beheld him going to bed in that state having been frightened into fits .
while the horses were being harnessed alpatych and ferapontov over their tea talked of the price of corn . the crops , and the good weather for harvesting , alpatych collected his parcels . handed them to the coachman who had come in , and settled up with the innkeeper . the noise of wheels , hoofs , and bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out . it was by now late in the afternoon , half the street was in shadow .
it was plain that his assailants were but baiting him . as men , in those days , baited the poor bull . or as the cat still trifles with the mouse , the skirmish was well over . farther down the road , a fellow in green was already calmly gathering the arrows . and now , in the evil pleasure of their hearts , they gave themselves the spectacle of their poor fellow sinner in his torture .
he wore a blue frock coat falling in a straight line round his thin body . and his leather cap , with its lappets knotted over the top of his head with string . showed under the turned up peak a bald forehead . flattened by the constant wearing of a helmet , he wore a [male] cloth waistcoat . a hair collar , grey trousers .
shoreby church tower not only commanded the town . as in a map , but looked far , on both sides , over sea and land . it was now near upon noon ; the day exceeding bright . the snow dazzling , and as [male] looked around him . he could measure the consequences of the battle .
captain [male] , who had been considered , especially by the churchills . as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain . for when his wife died , after a three years marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first . and with a child to maintain , from the expense of the child . however , he was soon relieved , the boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother 's .
one sign that his interest in her had changed its footing was that he dismissed any caution against her being a coquette setting snares to involve him in a vulgar flirtation . and determined that he would not again evade any opportunity of talking to her , he had shaken off mr. [female] . and got into a solitary corner in the twilight ; but half an hour was long enough to think of those possibilities in [female] 's position and state of mind . and on forming the determination not to avoid her , he remembered that she was likely to be at tea with the other ladies in the drawing room . the conjecture was true ; for [female] , after resolving not to go down again for the next four hours .
[female] put the motion , it was carried unanimously . and [female] gravely recorded it in her minutes . the next thing was to appoint a committee , and gertie pye . determined not to let [female] bell carry off all the laurels , boldly moved that miss [female] be chairman of said committee . this motion being also duly seconded and carried , [female] returned the compliment by appointing gertie on the committee .
it was almost noon before his troubles commenced again , then like a raging hot tide . the pain began in the soft , fleshy soles of his feet and mounted up inch by inch through the calves of his legs . through his aching thighs , through his tortured back , through his cringing neck . till the whole reeking misery seemed to foam and froth in his brain in an utter frenzy of furious resentment . again the day dragged by with maddening monotony and loneliness .
it was a rational scheme , to be sure , but from what the report of their engagement could originate . [female] was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of [female] . and her being the sister of [male] , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another . to supply the idea , she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . and her neighbours at [female] lodge .
poor little [female] , not seeing her way to the offering of any soothing words that would escape repudiation . deemed it best to remain quiet , at first , [female] took this ill , too . protesting to her looking glass , that of all the trying sisters a girl could have . she did think the most trying sister was a flat sister . that she knew she was at times a wretched temper .
the old woman being naturally a gossip , [female] was hardly seated before she began to pour out the talk of the town . in which came presently certain rumors concerning mr. [male] . mainly hints at speculation and loss . the result was that [female] went from beenie to the lawyer in whose care her father had left his affairs . he was an old man , and had been ill ; had no suspicion of anything being wrong .
there was a pause of strange enmity between the two men . that was very near to love , it was always the same between them ; always their talk brought them into a deadly nearness of contact . a strange , perilous intimacy which was either hate or love , or both . they parted with apparent unconcern , as if their going apart were a trivial occurrence . and they really kept it to the level of trivial occurrence .
i gave him an account of my stock as faithfully . that is to say , of what i had taken to carry with me , for i was resolved . whatever should happen , to keep what i had left with my governess in reserve . that in case i should die , what i had with me was enough to give him . and that which was left in my governess 's hands would be her own , which she had well deserved of me indeed .
franz and the countess exchanged a smile . and then the latter resumed her conversation with [female] . while [organization] returned to his previous survey of the house and company . the curtain rose on the ballet , which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school . admirably arranged and put on the stage by [male] , who has established for himself a great reputation throughout [location] for his taste and skill in the choreographic art .
he had [male] stationed his brigade in such a manner that . viewed from above and from a distance , one would have pronounced it the roman triangle of the battle of ecnomus . the boar 's head of [male] or the famous wedge of gustavus [male] . the base of this triangle rested on the back of the place in such a manner as to bar the entrance of the rue [male] parvis . one of its sides faced hotel dieu , the other the rue saint pierre aux boeufs .
in this determination , gathering a crew together , he went forward to set [male] in his former estate . news of this was brought unto [male] , who smiling at the cowardice of his brother . brooked all the injuries of fortune with patience . expecting the coming of the sheriff , as he walked upon the battlements of the house . he descried where [male] and he drew near .
these miles of railway travel since he had reached the cape had been so many separate reminders of the past and he had not arrived unshaken . but there on the platform stood conscience tollman . with a serene smile of welcome on her lips . and as the chauffeur took his bags she led him to the waiting car . the main street of the village with the shade of its elms and silver oaks .
there was nothing for it but to fell another hemlock and hew out another beam . which meant a day lost , radway occupied his men with shovels in clearing the edge of the road . and started one of his sprinklers over the place already cleared , water holes of suitable size had been blown in the creek bank by dynamite . there the machines were filled , it was a slow process . stratton attached his horse to the chain and drove him back and forth .
on such occasions a female attendant of the king ( previously acquainted with the woman whom the king desires ) . should loiter about , and accost this woman when she sets out to go home . and induce her to come and see the amusing things in the palace , previous to these festivals even . she should have caused it to be intimated to this woman that on the occasion of this festival she would show her all the interesting things in the royal palace . [female] she should show her the bower of the coral creeper .
long after [female] [male] had left him . mr. [male] sat idle at his desk meditating upon his interview with that gentleman . there was indeed a lurking desperation under [male] 's airy manner . of which the people amongst whom he lived had no suspicion . unless some sudden turn in the wheel of fortune should change the aspect of affairs for him very soon .
there was a slight bitterness in her voice and a cloud on her face . which her uncle heard and saw at once . half guessed the meaning of , and could not rest till he had found out . `` do you think [male] and [male] would not care to see you ? '' he asked , putting down a letter in which [female] gave a glowing account of a concert at which [female] surpassed herself .
he was successful , after many days , in bribing a passage to [organization] on a tramp steamer that was about to leave . and without loss of time [male] transferred his portmanteau . his ulster , and himself on board . and so it came about that at the same time that [male] povey sydney was travelling in luxury with his two lady companions between calais and [location] ( which latter city had been decided upon as the first stopping place in their journey ) . his unfortunate relative by marriage was passing the great red light on the scilly isles in a rousing south wester .
lieut , sir , you bear this bravely . as a brave man should , [male] why . sir , it is no light boon to die swiftly and surely at a given hour and in a given fashion ! truth to tell , i would gladly have my life . but if that may not be , i have the next best thing to it .
she turned her eyes to him again . and saw her late friend and [male] and trusted companion . who had seen fit suddenly to change into a lover , babbling interesting inacceptable things . he looked eager and flushed and troubled , his eyes caught at hers with passionate inquiries . `` tell me , '' he said ; `` speak to me . ''
taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense , we may say that . separated from every one by the walls of the tomb , [female] was the widower . and cosette was the orphan : this situation caused [female] to become cosette 's father after a celestial fashion . and in truth , the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of [male] grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion . but a reality , the entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god .
a locomotive is moving , someone asks : `` what moves it ? '' a peasant says the devil moves it . another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round . a third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away . the peasant is irrefutable , he has devised a complete explanation .
the two latter left the pincian by the broad and stately walk that skirts along its brow . beneath them , from the base of the abrupt descent . the city spread wide away in a close contiguity of red earthen roofs . above which rose eminent the domes of a hundred churches . beside here and there a tower , and the upper windows of some taller or higher situated palace .
the present [male] , holding mr [male] 's card in his hand . had a youthful aspect , and the fluffiest little whisker , perhaps , that ever was seen . such a downy tip was on his callow chin . that he seemed half fledged like a young bird ; and a compassionate observer might have urged that . if he had not singed the calves of his legs .
the 20th of july , 1852 , was a very great day for [male] . and indeed for the town of graybridge generally ; for on that day an excursion train left wareham for [location] . conveying such roving spirits as cared to pay a week 's visit to the great metropolis upon very moderate terms . [male] had a week 's holiday . which he was to spend with an old schoolfellow who had turned author .
when [female] was dressing , she longed , in remembrance of [female] . to put on the old turquoise necklace for her sole ornament . but she dared not offend her husband by appearing in that shabby way on an occasion when he would demand her utmost splendor . determined to wear the memorial necklace somehow , she wound it thrice round her wrist and made a bracelet of it . having gone to her room to put it on just before the time of entering the ball room .
but i merely shook my head , my excitement was as dead as ditch water . and my distaste for the prolongation of my mortal span had come back upon me more strongly than ever . besides , we neither of [female] knew what the effects of the fire might be . the result upon she had not been of an encouraging nature . and of the exact causes that produced that result we were .
the kings of [location] and [location] then took formal leave of each other . hiding , under an appearance of courtesy , the grounds of complaint which either had against the other . [male] against [male] , for what he deemed an officious interference betwixt him and [male] . and [male] against coeur [male] lion . for the disrespectful manner in which his mediation had been received , those whom this disturbance had assembled now drew off in different directions .
the rector had gone away for the day , being a man who disliked the sight of changes . he did not mean to return till the evening , when the new school teacher would have arrived and settled in . and everything would be smooth again , the blacksmith , the farm bailiff . and the schoolmaster himself were standing in perplexed attitudes in the parlour before the instrument . the master had remarked that even if he got it into the cart he should not know what to do with it on his arrival at christminster .
i write to you myself , especially , instead of getting one of the ladies here to do so . because i think it proper to tell you how things stand with myself . everything is changed with me since you and i parted because it was necessary that i should seek my fortune in [location] . you already know that i have abandoned that idea . and i now find that i shall leave the army altogether , my uncle has wished it since i first came here .
all the sympathies of mr. [male] were for [female] . she was the only human being younger than himself on board that ship since the ferndale carried no boys and was manned by a full crew of able seamen , yes ! their youth had created a sort of bond between them . mr. [female] 's open countenance must have appeared to her distinctly pleasing amongst the mature . rough , crabbed or even inimical faces she saw around her , with the warm generosity of his age young [male] was on her side .
in the midst of the tumult , and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged in the scene before me . i heard a hem close at my elbow : i turned . and saw [male] , `` oh , i will go by all means , '' i answered : and i was glad of the unexpected opportunity to gratify my much excited curiosity . i slipped out of the room , unobserved by any eye .
[male] lifted his hand , and the speaker sprang to a safer distance . obviously acquainted with its weight , having no desire to be entertained by a cat and dog combat . i stepped forward briskly , as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth . and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute . each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities : [male] placed his fists .
of the activities that presented themselves to him . army service was the simplest and most familiar , as a general on duty on kutuzov 's staff . he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work . not having found kuragin in [location] , prince [male] did not think it necessary to rush back to [location] after him . but all the same he knew that however long it might be before he met kuragin .
but it was bitter to him , bitter beyond all conception . to have this , the one joy of his life , snatched from him . he threw himself with ardour into the pursuit after wealth and dignity of position . partly because he had a legitimate desire for these things . and partly to assuage the constant irritation of his mind , but to no purpose .
[female] allowed her to soil her fingers a little in gardening . and even in some kind of household duties . she watered her beds of pink hollyhocks . purple foxgloves , perennial phloxes , and scarlet herb bennets . she took good advantage of the climate of guernsey .
but here the very gleams of [male] seemed melancholy , for the autumnal leaves and grass were shivering . and the wind was turning up the feathers of a cock and two croaking hens which had doubtless parted with their grown-up offspring and did not know what to do with themselves . the railway official also seemed without resources . and his innocent demeanor in observing [female] and her trunks was rendered intolerable by the cast in his eye . especially since , being a new man , he did not know her .
the affair , in short , had been of the kind that most of the young men of his age had been through . and emerged from with calm consciences and an undisturbed belief in the abysmal distinction between the women one loved and respected and those one enjoyed , and pitied . in this view they were sedulously abetted by their mothers . aunts and other elderly female relatives . who all shared mrs. [male] 's belief that when `` such things happened ''
nevertheless [female] did sit down to tea with the two lovers that night . there was a terrible scene between her and [female] ; but [female] held her own . and [female] , being the weaker of the two , was vanquished by the expenditure of her own small energies . [female] argued that as her sister 's chance was gone . and as the prize had come in her own way , there was no good reason why it should be lost to the family altogether .
it was so still in the barroom that one could have heard a match burn . [male] had drawn himself up stiff and straight before [male] . and stood facing him with defiance in every line of his stern , strong face . `` i have give you your rope , '' [male] said , feeling that he had been called to show his hand in an open manner that was not his style .
`` oh , i meant : dreary to do it without you or me , '' she laughed , getting up lazily to go indoors , a broad band of moonlight . dividing her room onto two shadowy halves , lay on the painted venetian bed with its folded back sheet . its old damask coverlet and lace edged pillows . she felt the warmth of [female] 's enfolding arm and lifted her face to his .
this letter she received before breakfast . and was therefore able to read it in solitude , and to keep its receipt from the knowledge of mrs. [female] . if she should be so minded , she understood at once all that it intended to convey . a hint that plaistow hall would be a better resting place for her than mrs. [female] 's cottage . and an assurance that if she would go to plaistow hall for her convenience .
as for the second opinion , it is sufficient to draw attention . as i did at the time , to the fact that the bishop is every inch a gentleman . and that the parish priest who figures in the narrative is one of its most estimable characters . however , the pages must speak for themselves , some few readers . i trust -- to take a serious view -- will be reminded by this imperfect story .
the lower windows of the house were lighted by this time . and mrs. [female] came to the back parlour window to call the young people to supper . they kept primitive hours at camberwell . and supper was the pleasantest meal in the day . for mrs. [female] 's work was done by that time .
yes , they were accomplices ; he could no more be jealous of her than she could despise him . the jealousy that would once have seemed a blur on her whiteness now appeared like a tribute to ideals in which he no longer believed ... glennard was little given to exploring the outskirts of literature . he always skipped the `` literary notices '' in the papers and he had small leisure for the intermittent pleasures of the periodical . he had therefore no notion of the prolonged reverberations which the `` aubyn letters ''
nearly an hour later she arrived at the castle . and , asking for [female] , was shown into the drawing room , where she found her sitting with a book in her hand . [female] rose to greet her in friendly fashion , for the two women . although they were at the opposite poles of character . had a liking for each other , in a way they were both strong .
i was frighted out of my wits almost , and knew not what to do . for i was , as it were , turned out of doors to the wide world . and that which was still worse , the old honest woman had two and twenty shillings of mine in her hand . which was all the estate the little gentlewoman had in the world . and when i asked the daughter for it .
i closed my eyes and called before me the faces of two beautiful women . i had never seen either of them in the life . of one , i had only a photograph ; of the other i had seen only a crude portrait in the parlour of the [female] cottage . but they had somehow assumed for me personalities distinct and vivid . [female] and [female] -- the tragedy of fate linked them together .
but , although the drive was a lovely one , and the view from either window delightful . and to [female] it was like getting out of a tomb to leave the shop in the middle of the day . she saw little of the sweet country on any side . so much occupied was she with hesper . ere they stopped again at the shop door , the two young women were nearer being friends than hesper had ever been with any one .
the [male] of course declared that he was not at all tired . and that he should be delighted of all things to go up and see old flurry . and thus they started , young grantly had not even been into the house before he left the yard with his father . of course , he was thinking of the coming sale at cosby lodge . and of his future life at pau , and of his injured position in the world .
being a woman is a terribly difficult trade since it consists principally of dealings with men . this man -- the man inside the cab . cast oft his stiff placidity and behaved like an animal . i do not mean it in an offensive sense , what he did was to give way to an instinctive panic . like some wild creature scared by the first touch of a net falling on its back .
the sun shone with a radiance not known on other days . he was shining upon holy things , and lighting men and women to holy duties . through all the farms the fields lay bathed in his genial glow . at rest , and the very trees stood in silent worship of the bending heavens . up from stable and from kitchen came no sounds of work .
he also furnished me with a grass hammock . and had it hung up there and then , so that i could lie down when inclined . there was nothing he would not do for me . and at last , when many more cups had been emptied , and a third or fourth jar brought out . he began to unburthen his heart of its dark and dangerous secrets .
her enthusiasm caught the boy , and for a few moment she forgot even his hunger . and holding his mother 's hand , gazed up at the western sky . it was a picture of rare beauty that lay stretched out from the manse back door . close to the barn came the pasture field dotted with huge stumps . then the brule where the trees lay fallen across one another , over which the fire had run .
the public reading of one of her devoirs achieved the revelation of her talents to all and sundry . i remember the subject -- it was an emigrant 's letter to his friends at home . it opened with simplicity ; some natural and graphic touches disclosed to the reader the scene of virgin forest and great . new world river -- barren of sail and flag . amidst which the epistle was supposed to be indited , the difficulties and dangers that attend a settler 's life .
but mr. [male] , contrite and unhappy . hurried away to apologize to the rev , cuthbert eager , [male] , apparently absorbed in a lunette . could hear the lecture again interrupted , the anxious , aggressive voice of the old man . the curt , injured replies of his opponent . the son , who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy .
in religious ceremonies she should be a leader . as also in vows and fasts , and should not hold too good an opinion of herself . when her husband is lying on his bed she should only go near him when it is agreeable to him . and should never rebuke him , or show obstinacy in any way . if her husband happens to quarrel with any of his other wives , she should reconcile them to each other .
with that he held the door open for me . and as i turned into my room , shook hands with me in a friendly manner . bidding me expect him on the morrow . i did not see him , i began dismally to think that after all the whole thing was at an end . he did not live at [male] -- he had certainly never told me that he did .
they could walk , and hold themselves up ; there was substance in their good looks . the modern woman had no build , no chest , no anything ! he remembered suddenly with what intoxication of pride he had walked round with [male] in the first years of his first marriage . and how they used to lunch on the drag which his mother would make his father have . because it was so `` chic '' -- all drags and carriages in those days .
the indecisiveness , or feebleness , of his movements was more pronounced . his walk was actually tottery as he came down the port side of the cabin . at the break of the poop he reeled . raised one hand to his eyes with the familiar brushing gesture . and fell down the steps—still on his feet—to the main deck .
so leslie telephoned [female] that she would be very busy with housekeeping affairs the coming two days . she made a list of what would be required for that day . left the maids to collect it , and went to buy seeds and a few tools . then returning she divided her forces and leaving part to pack the bedding . old dishes and things absolutely required for living .
i sent her no message ; i simply went down to the sala and walked to and fro there . i knew she would come out ; she would very soon discover i was there . somehow i preferred not to be shut up with her ; gardens and big halls seemed better places to talk . it was a splendid morning , with something in the air that told of the waning of the long venetian summer . a freshness from the sea which stirred the flowers in the garden and made a [female] draught in the house .
he was not a profound student ; a literary trifler rather . caring for only a limited number of books , and reading those again and again . [male] 's anatomy of melancholy . [male] 's doctor , montaigne , and swift . he read continually , he was a collector of rare editions of the classics .
mrs delvile received her with the most distinguished politeness . she conducted her to the apartment which had been prepared for her . led her to the library , which she desired her to make use of as her own . and gave her the most obliging charges to remember that she was in a house of which she had the command . young delvile did not make his appearance till dinner time .
there was literally nothing but some loose bricks , however , those he got . and taking off his coat he covered them with it as well as he could . he pulled her feet to the fire . which now began to emit some faint heat , he looked round for water . but the poor woman had been too weak to drag herself out to the distant pump .
it was even doubtful if the certainty of her own ruin would check her . her love was everything to her , it was her life . the thing she lived for , and rather than tamely lose it . it seemed extremely probable to [female] that she would not hesitate to face shame . or even death , indeed it was through this great passion of hers .
it was what [female] had called for , and the tone was thus . almost by accident , determined for milly before her friend came up , what was also . however , determined for her was , again , yet irrepressibly again , that the image presented to her . the splendid young woman who looked so particularly handsome in impatience . with the fine freedom of her signal , was the peculiar property of somebody else 's vision .
but lady [male] 's dreams flew away at once into the seventh heaven . sordid as they certainly were , they were not absolutely selfish , [male] would now certainly be the first commoner in barsetshire . of course he would represent the county . of course there would be the house in town . it would not be her house , but she was contented that the grandeur should be that of her child .
he was used to [location] restaurants . and to quite expensive hotels , for at least once a year , on his birthday . mr. [male] took him to lunch at the waldorf . while he had apparently been devoting himself to arranging the tables his cunning old brain had determined to order tea and french pastry . apparently the tea shoppe was neutral , there was no french pastry on the bill .
`` i am not afraid , '' answered sonya 's voice . and along the path toward [female] came the crunching . whistling sound of sonya 's feet in her thin shoes . sonya came along , wrapped in her cloak , she was only a couple of paces away when she saw him . and to her too he was not the [female] she had known and always slightly feared .
the desert was her ring , and she had reined her steeds to her will . keeping them out of my way and [female] 's at all costs . no matter whether they saw the sphinx in back view or noseless profile . but mrs. [female] 's principal occupation in life was not to get me engaged to the gilded rose . and either she lost her presence of mind .
if the path is well known the difficulty at such times of keeping therein is not altogether great . from its familiar feel to the feet ; but once lost it is irrecoverable . owing to her baby , who somewhat impeded thomasin 's view forward and distracted her mind . she did at last lose the track , this mishap occurred when she was descending an open slope about two thirds home . instead of attempting , by wandering hither and thither , the hopeless task of finding such a mere thread .
`` here , '' said the soldier , as they swung out of the wood and into the open . `` is what they call the port of missing men . '' there was a broad park like area that tended downward almost imperceptibly to a deep defile . they dismounted and walked to the edge and looked down the steep sides . a little creek flowed out of the wood and emptied itself with a silvery rush into the vale .
while these solemnities were in progress , mr [male] approached the chair of mrs [female] . and bending over the back of it . trifled for some few seconds with mrs [female] 's bracelet . slightly in contrast with this brief airy toying . one might have noticed a certain dark attention in mrs [female] 's face as she said some words with her eyes on mr [female] 's waistcoat .
the steersmen climbed to their niches , and the huge steering oars creaked as they were swung out . came a short word of command from [male] and a stir ran through the ranks of the slaves . as they threw forward their weight to bring the oars to the level . thus a moment , then a second word , the premonitory crack of a whip in the darkness of the gangway . and the tomtom began to beat the time , the slaves heaved .
the walls were so near to one another , and the wild clouds hurried over them so fast . that it gave him a sensation like the beginning of sea sickness to look up at the gusty sky . the rain , carried aslant by flaws of wind . blackened that side of the central building which he had visited last night . but left a narrow dry trough under the lee of the wall .
then [male] tossed in valise and rug . without which last no englishman ever goes on a journey , and with much effort they managed to pull the box along and hoist it also into the wagon . the body of which was filled with corn fodder . covered with an old patchwork quilt , the wagon was of the rudest . clumsiest construction , the heavy box set on axles without springs .
she uttered a faint `` ah ! mr , [male] ! '' i could read in her eyes that she had recognized me now . her serious expression extinguished the imbecile grin of which i was conscious . i raised my hat , she responded with a slow inclination of the head while her luminous . mistrustful , maiden 's glance seemed to whisper , `` what is this one doing here ? ''
she obtained permission to speak alone with the patient . on condition that they both remained well within the nurse 's view . there was no time for questions -- there was only time for miss [female] to impress on the unhappy lady the necessity of controlling herself . and to assure her of immediate help and rescue if she did so . the prospect of escaping from the asylum by obedience to her sister 's directions was sufficient to quiet lady [female] .
[male] did not answer , perhaps already he was thinking of something else . i should have liked to be sure exactly what his smile meant . was it for [male] ? was it for [male] ? or only for an adventure which he saw in the distance ? to be sure , we had brought learned books , and took pains to leave them in our chairs .
[female] pondered gravely over this gossip of the kemberling people . it was not so very improbable , perhaps , after all , olivia only held [female] towers on sufferance . it might be that , rather than be turned out of her stately home , she would accept the hand of its rightful owner . she would marry [female] , perhaps , as she had married his brother . for the sake of a fortune and a position .
then his world grows larger as the months pass one by one , until he is sent to a little brown schoolhouse a mile away and finds a small crowd of boys and girls . only two or three of whom he ever saw before , one of them is the girl who looked wonderingly at him a year previous . he tells her he knows what her name is . and feels a little hurt because that fact does not seem to interest her . he studies his lessons because he is told he must .
was greatly increased , it was already known that he was going to plumstead that night . and it was partly understood that he was engaged with the grantly and [male] faction in defending mr. [male] the clergyman against the [male] faction . [male] , who was still at the inn , as he saw his enemy get into the plumstead carriage . felt himself to be one of the palace party . and felt that if mrs. [female] had only lived till after the assizes all this heavy trouble would not have befallen him .
without the hope of helping in the highest sense , [female] could not have taken up her abode in such a house as mrs. redmain 's . no outward service of any kind , even to the sick . was to her service enough to choose ; were it laid upon her . she would hasten to it ; for necessity is the push . gentle or strong , as the man is more or less obedient , by which god sends him into the path he would have him take .
philip asked about the child , she was still at elm cottage in the care of the woman with the upturned nose and the shrill voice . every night he devised plans for getting possession of [male] 's little one . and every morning he abandoned them . as difficult or cruel or likely to be spurned , on easter monday he was busy in his room at ballure . with a mounted messenger riding constantly between his gate and government offices .
and now , in this year before rail and steamboat . the glory of early summer was at hand . and the wilderness people were coming up to meet the freight . the three rivers -- the athabasca , the slave . and the mackenzie , all joining in one great two thousand mile waterway to the northern sea .
`` you must come to lockleigh again , '' said [female] , very sweetly , to [female] . ignoring this remark of [female] 's friend . [female] looked into her quiet eyes a moment . and for that moment seemed to see in their grey depths the reflexion of everything she had rejected in rejecting lord warburton . the [female] , the kindness , the honour .
when at last pelleas reached the forest , he was so hot and tired that he dismounted . and tying his horse to a tree , he lay down gratefully under a large oak and fell asleep . sounds of laughter and merriment woke him . and opening his eyes he saw a group of maidens close by . they wore bright dresses , blue and yellow and purple .
david called him in that night and dismissed him again . this time very firmly , [male] said nothing and went out . but the next morning he was scrubbing the sidewalk as usual . and after that they gave it up , now and then [female] and [female] met on the street . and she bowed to him and went on , at those times it seemed incredible that once he had held her in his arms .
pierre no longer suffered moments of despair . hypochondria , and disgust with life . but the malady that had formerly found expression in such acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment . `` what for ? why ? what is going on in the world ? '' he would ask himself in perplexity several times a day . involuntarily beginning to reflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life .
now leave we aucassin , and speak we of nicolete . the ship wherein she was cast pertained to the king of carthage . and he was her father . and she had twelve brothers . all princes or kings , when they beheld nicolete .
`` oh , i must think of that then , '' she seemed disappointed that i would not tie myself to a period . and i guessed that she wished both to secure me and to discourage me . to say severely , do you dream that you can get off with less than six months ? do you dream that even by the end of that time you will be appreciably nearer your victory ? what was more in my mind was that she had a fancy to play me the trick of making me engage myself when in fact she had annihilated the papers .
they all left the house , and all joined the throng of villagers collected round the grave . where the statuary 's man was waiting for us . in a breathless silence , the first sharp stroke of the steel sounded on the marble . not a voice was heard -- not a soul moved , till those three words . [female] , lady [female] ,
there was great excitement for the next few days at [organization] and throughout the neighbourhood . for the annesley setons made no secret of the robbery . and the affair got into the papers , not only the local ones . but the [location] dailies , two of the latter sent representatives . to whom lord annesley seton granted interviews , something he said attracted the reporters
verbal messages from those who loved him ; news of the world . all at long intervals , however , quinnox 's visits were like sunbeams to him . the dashing captain came only at night and in disguise . he bore verbal messages , a wise precaution against mishap . not once did he bring a word of love from the princess .
doolittle , i have , but i am dressed something special today . i am going togeorge 's , hanover square . your stepmother is going to marry me , pickering [ quietly ] he ought to , eliza . [ to doolittle ] why has she changed her mind , doolittle . do not be afraid : she never comes to words with anyone now , poor woman !
so saying he pulled out a silver cup , and filling it with water from a gourd which stood by the bedside . he next drew forth a small silken bag made of network . twisted with silver , the contents of which the bystanders could not discover . and immersing it in the cup , continued to watch it in silence during the space of five minutes . it seemed to the spectators as if some effervescence took place during the operation .
he revolved the means which might effect his purpose . he saw but one -- this was the death of the marchioness . the commission of one crime often requires the perpetration of another . when once we enter on the ladyrinth of vice . we can seldom return , but are led on , through correspondent mazes , to destruction .
early in the morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tent . which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen . and looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of the vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across the river . the troops , knowing of the emperor 's presence . were on the lookout for him , and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill .
but the joy of the sunrise would linger about [male] all the day long in the gloomy shop . and for [male] , he had but to lift his head to see the sun hastening on to the softer and yet more hopeful splendors of the evening . the wife , who had not to begin so early , was walking with her husband . as was her custom , even when the weather was not of the best , to see him fairly started on his day 's work . it was with something very like pride .
we none of us . i suppose ( by we i mean the bonne , the cook . the portress , and myself , all which personages were now gathered in the small and heated chamber ) . looked very scrutinizingly at the new doctor when he came into the room . i , at least , was taken up with endeavouring to soothe [male] ; whose cries were appalling to hear .
no one said a word about it . but [female] offered to dress her hair , and annie to tie her sash . and [female] , the engaged sister , praised her white arms . but in their kindness meg saw only pity for her poverty . and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself .
if mr. [female] would but go away , that was what she most earnestly desired . go and take his sister with him , as he was to do . and as he returned to mansfield on purpose to do , and why it was not done already she could not devise . for miss [female] certainly wanted no delay , [female] had hoped . in the course of his yesterday 's visit .
after the funeral it was decided to read the will at once , [female] 's husband was anxious to return to buffalo . [female] was compelled to be in [location] , a conference of the various members of the family was called for the second day after the funeral . to be held at the offices of messrs. [male] . [male] and [male] , counselors of the late manufacturer . as [male] rode to the meeting he had the feeling that his father had not acted in any way prejudicial to his interests .
believe that at all times , and under all circumstances , i am still your loving mother . as i was in other days , he had been once at carlton gardens since the season had commenced . and the lady had favoured him with her sweetest smile . but he had only been half a minute alone with her . and during that half minute had only time to remark that he supposed she would now remain in [location] for the season .
garth 's man , simpson , received her at the door . and again a possible danger was safely passed , he had entered [male] 's service within the last three years and evidently did not know her by sight . [male] stood looking round the old hall . in the leisurely way of one accustomed to arrive for the first time as guest at the country homes of her friends . noting the quaint , large fireplace , and the shadowy antlers high up on the walls .
it was all i could say , that one bad man . for his own purposes , should influence another bad man to an act of justice . and that their double evil should be made to work out our good , also , that this should come just in our time of need . when [male] 's strength seemed ready to fail , that was his wife 's first cry . as she clung to him almost in tears .
that was what made it so touchingly absurd , he put himself in her position . he pictured himself as her . `` sitting up in bed , '' pencil in hand . to explain away , to soothe , to clinch and bind ... yes , if he had happened to be some other man . one whom her insult might have angered without giving love its death blow , and one who could be frightened out of not keeping his word .
with that smile , which was almost cheerful , she bade me good night . rather hastily , perhaps , as if she wished to leave me while her cheerfulness lasted . then i heard her step along the passage , pausing once -- most likely at guy 's room door . her own closed , and the house was in silence , i rose early in the morning . not one whit too early , for i met miss silver in the hall .
next day she put her pride in her pocket . went to [female] , told the truth , and asked her to buy the silk as a favor . the good natured mrs. [female] willingly did so , and had the delicacy not to make her a present of it immediately afterward . then meg ordered home the greatcoat , and when [female] arrived . she put it on , and asked him how he liked her new silk gown .
at this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene . they had talked of no one but morcerf the whole day . [male] understood the allusion in a moment . and was about to throw his glove at the count , when [male] seized his hand . while beauchamp and chateau renaud , fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge .
and this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest prince [male] had felt in the impending reforms . he was going to dine that evening at [male] 's , `` with only a few friends , '' as the host had said when inviting him , the prospect of that dinner in the intimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested prince [male] . especially as he had not yet seen [male] in his domestic surroundings . but now he felt disinclined to go to it , at the appointed hour .
`` i do not believe he will , '' the child asserted . mockingly , and she moved away into the drive , [female] watched the isolated figure . and her heart stood still , [female] was playing with a little rivulet of water . absorbedly as if nothing had been said , `` i have made a proper dam , '' she said , out of the moist distance .
but mr. [female] was of opinion that the circumstances would enable the judge to call upon the grand jury not to find a true bill against mr. [male] . and that the whole affair , as far as mr. [male] was concerned , would thus be brought to an end . [male] was still very anxious to place [male] in the dock . but mr. [male] declared that they would fail if they made the attempt . [male] had been examined before the magistrates at barchester .
but this day it was with more than ordinary restlessness and lack of interest that she stood . knelt , and sat , through the routine of observance . for old mr. [male] was certainly duller than usual : how could it be otherwise . when he had been preparing to spend a mortal hour in descanting on the reasons which necessitated the separation of all true baptists from all brother believers ? the narrow , high souled little man -- for a soul as well as a forehead can be both high and narrow .
[male] answered briefly , confining himself to an expression of thanks . there was great cheering and then the carriage moved on , the journey thereafter was one long triumphal passage . at sulby street , and at ballaugh street , there were flags and throngs of people . from time to time other carriages joined them . falling into line behind , the bishop was waiting at bishop 's court .
on the twenty fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain . and after dinner [male] left [location] . when changing horses that night in perkhushkovo . he learned that there had been a great battle that evening , ( this was the battle of shevardino . ) he was told that there in perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing .
to make that reply and then perish , what could be grander ? for being willing to die is the same as to die . and it was not this man 's fault if he survived after he was shot . the winner of the battle of waterloo was not [male] . who was put to flight ; nor [location] , giving way at four o'clock . in despair at five ; nor [male] , who took no part in the engagement .
she was shown at once into mr slow 's room . and the first thing that met her eyes was a copy of that horrible [male] examiner . lying on the table before him , she knew it instantly . and would have known it had she simply seen a corner of the printing . to her eyes and to her mind , no other printed paper had ever been so ugly and so vicious .
two pretty rustic bridges spanned the ravine , one near the front entrance . the other at the rear , my grandfather had begun his house on a generous plan . but , buried as it was among the trees , it suffered from lack of perspective . however , on one side toward the lake was a fair meadow . broken by a water tower , and just beyond the west dividing wall i saw a little chapel .
so [female] was glad , and after the knight and lavaine had ridden away . she went up the turret stair again to her little room . she took the shield from the corner . and handled the bruises and dints in it lovingly . and made pictures to herself of all the battles and tournaments it had been through with her knight .
`` to your places , '' cried the young officer to the men gathered round [male] . the young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with great precision and formality . the booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more intense over the whole field . especially to the left where bagration 's fleches were . but where [male] was the smoke of the firing made it almost impossible to distinguish anything .
the words died upon her lips , and from very faintness she bent her head . for instead of rushing forward to her he had stood still ; and there appeared upon his face a look which there was no mistaking , yes . he was shocked at her worn and faded aspect . the image he had mentally carried out with him to the cape he had brought home again as that of the woman he was now to rejoin . but another woman sat before him , and not the original viviette .
as i delivered the blow a low laugh rang out behind me . and , turning , i beheld tars tarkas , sola , and three or four warriors standing in the doorway of the chamber . as my eyes met theirs i was . for the second time , the recipient of their zealously guarded applause . my absence had been noted by sola on her awakening .
hence the fighting parson in the old play of sir [male] . and the famous friar of robin hood 's band . nor were such characters ideal , there exists a monition of the bishop of durham against irregular churchmen of this class . who associated themselves with border robbers . and desecrated the holiest offices of the priestly function , by celebrating them for the benefit of thieves .
this , with occasional cracklins made up our entire bill of fare for many months . father would make brooms and mats from straw and chair bottoms from cane and reeds . in which my brother and i would help him . after he had taught [male] how , during the week a large load was made and friday night father would take the load on his shoulders and walk to town . a dozen miles , where he would sell them and bring seed and food home .
i could easily receive it by writing to the postmaster if i happened to be away from the town when it arrived . the vestry of old welmingham church was the starting point from which my mind slowly worked its way back through all that i had heard mrs. [female] say . and through all i had seen mrs. [female] do . what had been the nature of the crime ? surely there was a contemptible side to it . as well as a dangerous side , or mrs. [male] would not have repeated my own words .
time for the second step in the plan of campaign ! i touched a button , and shook the bones of england loose from her spine ! in that explosion all our noble civilization factories went up in the air and disappeared from the earth . it was a pity , but it was necessary . we could not afford to let the enemy turn our own weapons against us .
her presence was wanted ; she was sought for , and attended , and praised . and [female] was at first in some danger of envying her the character she had accepted . but reflection brought better feelings , and shewed her that mrs. grant was entitled to respect . which could never have belonged to her ; and that , had she received even the greatest . she could never have been easy in joining a scheme which , considering only her uncle .
my dear girl , -- he flung out his hand -- have you eyes ? have you a skin ? how could it be anything but damp in such a situation ? in the first place , the grange is on clay . and built where the castle moat must have been ; then there 's that destestable little river .
but , fortunately for her , she felt her eyes growing misty . she saw nothing clearly , her pulse beat a hundred to the minute . and the blood throbbed at her heart . she could not assume that pose , which would have made her ridiculous , and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all her might to conceal it . and this was the very attitude that became her best , before and behind them other visitors were entering .
annesley did not like the persistent way in which he spoke of himself as a [male] sheep who . at best , could be whitened , and trained not to disgrace the fold ; yet it piqued her interest . books said that women had a weakness for men who were not good and she supposed that she was like the rest . he was so dear and chivalrous that certain defiant hints as to his lack of virtue vaguely added to the spice of mystery which decorated the background of the picture . the vivid picture of the `` stranger knight . ''
his aunt ( my [female] you will please to remember ) . deliberately , wilfully , added to my trials and vexations , it was her delight to expatiate on the style in which we were to live in [location] . and on the establishment we should keep , and the company we should entertain when he got his advancement . my pride rose against this barefaced way of pointing out the contrast my married life was to present to my then dependent and inferior position . i suppressed my indignation ; but i showed her that her intention was not lost upon me .
was weak , too , in the eyes , and subject to racking headaches , so that it was considered generally that she was unable to take much active part in the education of the pupils . but it was considered as generally that she did all the thinking . that she knew more than any other woman in barsetshire . and that all the prettyman schemes for education emanated from her mind . it was said , too , by those who knew them best , that her sister 's good nature was as nothing to hers .
for this reason the belgians approached their trenches not through deep cuts which gave them shelter but with no other cover than the darkness of night . during the day , they lay in their shallow dugouts . cut off from any connection with the world behind them . food , cooked miles away , came up at night . cold and unappetizing , for water .
when she arrived at the iron gate under the bunched evergreens . her steps paused , for this was where she had met [male] for the first time . he had taken her through the stables and pointed out to her silver braid 's box . she remembered the horses going to the downs . horses coming from the downs -- stabling and the sound of hoofs everywhere .
as soon as this was settled , stanbury went to the office of the d. [male] and made arrangement as to his work for three days . [male] could do the article on the irish church upon a pinch like this . although he had not given much study to the subject as yet . and puddlethwaite , who was great in city matters , would try his hand on the present state of society in [male] . a subject on which it was essential that the d. [male] should express itself at once .
he looked at his watch , old and thin like himself . he had owned it fifty years . past four already , and kissing the top of holly 's head in passing . he went down to the hall , he wanted to get hold of her before she went up to give her lesson . at the first sound of wheels he stepped out into the porch .
one morning , when boulatruelle was on his way to his work . at daybreak , he had been surprised to see , at a nook of the forest in the underbrush . a shovel and a pickaxe , concealed , as one might say , towards the end of october . in that same year , 1823 , the inhabitants of toulon beheld the entry into their port . after heavy weather , and for the purpose of repairing some damages .
walking slowly to the tavern my mind still went back to my little playmate and the golden days of youth . and if my heart grew a little tenderer , and my eyes were moistened by the recall . what need to be ashamed of the emotion ? and if in the night i dreamed that i was a boy again . and that a fair haired child played with me in the changing glow of dreamland in the best and purest scenes of the human comedy . was it a delusion to be dispelled , a memory to be put aside ?
one morning , in the fall of 1880 , a middle-aged woman . accompanied by a young girl of eighteen , presented herself at the clerk 's desk of the principal hotel in [location] . [location] , and made inquiry as to whether there was anything about the place that she could do . she was of a helpless , fleshy build . with a [female] , open countenance and an innocent , diffident manner .
mr. [male] went to the bedside and took up one of the delicate hands and kissed it . a slight pressure from the small fingers told him that it was worth while to have come upstairs for the sake of doing that . he lingered a moment , looking at her . and then turned away and left the room , treading very gently -- he had taken off his boots and put on slippers before he came upstairs . whoever remembers how many things he has declined to do even for himself .
[female] , rallying her spirits , and recovering her complexion . replied only , `` if i had known this before , i would have spoken of the cloth with more respect , '' and turned the subject , the chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness which reigned in it . with few interruptions , throughout the year , [female] , displeased with her sister . led the way , and all seemed to feel that they had been there long enough .
shuffling , halting , irregular footsteps of various kinds were now heard coming up the hill . and presently there emerged from the shade severally five men of different ages and gaits . all of them working villagers of the parish of mellstock . they , too , had lost their rotundity with the daylight . and advanced against the sky in flat outlines , which suggested some processional design on greek or etruscan pottery .
an hour later two discreet messengers were bounding across the plains . bearing words from the chief maputa , the warden of the border . to the `` great [male] elephant '' at ulundi , fortune showed itself strangely favourable to the plans of nahoon and nanea . one of the zulu captain 's perplexities was as to how he should lull the suspicions and evade the vigilance of his own companions . who together with himself had been detailed by the king to assist hadden in his hunting and to guard against his escape .
there was a great deal to do , and [male] was grateful for it . but first , like [male] , he went in and sat by [male] 's bed alone and talked to her . not aloud , as [female] did , but still with that same queer conviction that she heard . he told her he was free . and that she need not worry about [male] , that he was there now to look after him .
in fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work . and they took hold with a will , but soon realized the truth of [male] 's saying . `` housekeeping ai not no joke , '' there was plenty of food in the larder . and while beth and [male] set the table . meg and jo got breakfast , wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work .
the spirits of the company revived , optimism reigned . principals smiled happily and said they had believed in the thing all along . the ladies and gentlemen of the ensemble chattered contentedly of a year 's run in [location] . and the citizens of hartford fought for seats . and , if they could not get seats , stood up at the back .
`` dear [male] , '' he began , when he had got down . and saw her in the candle light of the large room . but she adroitly passed out at the other door , at which he took a candle and followed her to the small room . `` dear [male] , do let me speak , '' he repeated . as soon as the rays revealed her figure , but she passed into the bakehouse before he could say more .
there in the desert the man took his first temperance pledge . urged thereto by a girl who had never heard of a temperance pledge in her life . had never joined a woman 's temperance society . and knew nothing about women 's crusades . her own heart had taught her out of a bitter experience just how to use her god given influence .
she held out her hand , the crowd had gone . traffic was moving again , racing to make up for five lost precious moments , the square was dark . that first darkness of [location] , when air raids were threatened but had not yet taken place . from the top of the admiralty , near by , a flashlight shot up into the air and began its nightly process of brushing the sky . [female] took her hand and bent over it .
theodore [male] , when he reached the drawing room . went up to his sister and kissed her , such a sign of the tenderness of love was not common with him . for he was one of those who are not usually demonstrative in their affection , at the present moment he said nothing of what was passing in his mind . nor did she , she simply raised her face to meet his lips . and pressed his hand as she held it .
they passed within ten feet of him . talking earnestly together , at the curb they hailed a cab and drove away . [male] with satisfaction heard them call the name of a hotel . [male] whirled sharp on his heel and returned at once to a boarding house off fort street . where he had `` outfitted '' three months before , there he reclaimed his valise .
britain , who had been paying the profoundest and most melancholy attention to each speaker in his turn . seemed suddenly to decide in favour of the same preference , if a deep sepulchral sound that escaped him might be construed into a demonstration of risibility . his face , however , was so perfectly unaffected by it , both before and afterwards . that although one or two of the breakfast party looked round as being startled by a mysterious noise . nobody connected the offender with it .
troy fell , the distance apart of the two men was so small that the charge of shot did not spread in the least . but passed like a bullet into his body , he uttered a long guttural sigh . there was a contraction -- an extension -- then his muscles relaxed . and he lay still , [male] was seen through the smoke to be now again engaged with the gun . it was double barrelled , and he had , meanwhile , in some way fastened his hand kerchief to the trigger .
of those who do not believe , some have never had a noble picture of god presented to them . but whether their phantasm is of a mean god because they refuse him . or they refuse him because their phantasm of him is mean . who can tell ? anyhow , mean notions must come of meanness . and , uncharitable as it may appear , i can not but think there is a moral root to all chosen unbelief .
at sils maria she was brought suddenly to earth again , it must not be forgotten that her driver was [male] man . and therefore at constant feud with the men from the kursaal . who brought empty carriages tomoritz , and went back laden with the spoil that would otherwise have fallen to the share of the local livery stables . hence , he made it a point of honor to pass every maloja owned vehicle on the road . six times he succeeded , but , on the seventh , reversing the moral of bruce 's spider .
monk , astonished at this language , which established between him and the french gentleman equality at least . raised his piercing eye to the stranger 's face . and with a sensible irony conveyed by the inflection of his voice alone . for not a muscle of his face moved , -- i thank you , [male] , ', said he . `` but , in the first place , to whom have i the honor of speaking ? ''
there was no love in him , he had no tenderness for her . he did not want to cherish her , serve her , glorify her . only she made him mad with passion . but , according to his private lights , he was honest , and wished to be . and was therefore commanded to try to save the girl from his wicked will and hers .
d'artagnan and [male] did not require twice bidding . they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door . leaped upon them , buried their spurs in their sides . and set off at full gallop , `` do you know what has become of [male] ? '' asked [male] of [male] , as they galloped on .
[male] had little to say , the nurse cautioned them that he was not to be talked to much . when they were gone [male] said to [male] . `` imogene has changed a good deal , '' he made no other comment . mrs. [female] was on the atlantic three days out from [location] the afternoon [male] died . he had been meditating whether anything more could be done for [male] .
so [male] and [male] set out , arm in arm , down bridge street . across the bridge , and then clambered up the hill , on the way he gave her the directions she asked for about her behaviour as bride and most honoured guest . and altogether succeeded , against his intention and will , in frightening her so completely as to the grandeur and importance of the occasion . and the necessity of remembering certain set rules . and making certain set speeches and attending to them when the right time came .
well , she was getting an old woman , swithin and he had seen her crowned . slim slip of a girl , not so old as imogen ! she had got very stout of late , jolyon and he had seen her married to that german chap . her husband -- he had turned out all right before he died . and left her with that son of his , and he remembered the many evenings he and his brothers and their cronies had wagged their heads over their wine and walnuts and that fellow in his salad days .
it was evident that she was most keenly interested in all that he did . that , in a way , she looked upon his career as a thing in which she had a share . even if it was only a friend 's share . and when calder had ended he looked again at durrance . but now with a face of relief , it seemed .
at length arrived the moment when the chill remains of these two gentlemen were to be given back to mother earth . there was such an affluence of military and other people that up to the place of the sepulture . which was a little chapel on the plain , the road from the city was filled with horsemen and pedestrians in mourning . [male] had chosen for his resting place the little inclosure of a chapel erected by himself near the boundary of his estates . he had had the stones , cut in 1550 , brought from an old [location] in berry .
she stopped to hold out her hand for the note which a servant was bringing in . but her face fell when the missive was presented to me . liebe mai -- it began -- will you come and help me in my trouble ? [male] is very ill , sometimes he is delirious , he calls for you often . it breaks my heart to find that after all not a word is uttered of us .
a bunch of anemones caught mrs. [female] 's eye when they had finished luncheon . the blue and purple and white of the bowl . standing in a pool of variegated light on a polished [female] table in the drawing room window . made her stop dead with an exclamation of pleasure . it happened that mrs. [female] had an engagement elsewhere .
milla , ah , to marry an ignorant that can hardly read or write , foot . sir , my lady 's dressing . here 's company , if you please to walk in , in the meantime , sir wil , dressing ! what , it 's but morning here , i warrant . with you in [location] ; we should count it towards afternoon in our parts down in shropshire .
when that moment had flashed away , he saw that the man striding on before him was the man who had been so much in his mind during the last few days . it was no casual resemblance , helped out by the force of the impression the man made upon him . it was the man ; the man he had followed in company with the girl . and whom he had overheard talking to miss [female] , the street was a sharp descent and was crooked too . and the man ( who although not drunk had the air of being flushed with some strong drink ) .
as [female] had her day of misfortunes . so this seemed to be one of small temptations to rose , after she had set [female] down at home and been to see her new houses . she drove about doing various errands for the aunts and . while waiting in the carriage for the execution of an order . young [male] came by , as [male] said , this gentleman had been `` hard hit ''
but tomorrow found him still lingering at the priory . in a hopeless , purposeless way , lingering for he knew not what . lingering , perhaps , for want of the mere physical energy required for the brief effort of departure . he would go to constantinople overland ; there would be more fatigue in the journey that way . might not a walk across mount cenis cure him of his foolish love for [male] ?
the distraught [female] , sitting by her sleeping child . was at last made to realize , by its peaceful breathing that all danger was over . there was nothing more that she could do for [female] . and now the claims of the home that she had deserted began to reassert themselves . the promise to [female] and the need of being loyal to her duties unto the very end .
it was sir [male] 's wish that the wedding should be strictly private . whom could he invite to assist at his union with a nameless and friendless bride ? miss [female] was the only person whom he could trust . and even her he had deceived ; for she believed that [female] was some fourth or fifth [male] . some poor relative of sir [female] 's , early in july the wedding took place .
everything that mrs. [organization] saw reassured her . the routine of the house seemed to be reasonable and healthy , the mornings were devoted to lessons in the library . after lunch the pupils went out over the fields or into the woods where considine instructed them in details of farming and forestry . their work was not merely theoretical , they had to learn to use their hands as well as their brains . to plough a furrow , or bank a hedge .
but fortune had another fling for him to endure . it got about the hotel that [male] was . to use the mildest expression , conducting herself strangely , a girl who carries washing must expect criticism if anything not befitting her station is observed in her apparel . [female] was seen wearing the gold watch . her mother was informed by the housekeeper of the state of things .
princess : we greet you , ladies . what would you with us ? hilarion : what shall i say ? we are three students , ma'am , three well born maids of liberal estate . who wish to join this university , princess : if , as you say . you wish to join our ranks , and will subscribe to all our rules .
he lingered and lingered on , till there was no difference between the eastern and western expanses of sky . and the timid hares began to limp courageously round the dim hillocks . [male] might have been there an additional half hour when a dark form walked slowly by . `` good night , [female] , '' the passer said . [female] likewise vanished up the road .
in great despair at last , he resolved to settle in some outlandish part . where none could be found to know him ; and so , in an evil day for us . he came to the west of england . not that our part of the world is at all outlandish , according to my view of it ( for i never found a better one ) . but that it was known to be rugged , and large , and desolate , and here .
he went in and sitting on the side of his bed sipped at his milk . [male] was right , it was not in their hands . he had the feeling all at once of having relinquished a great burden . he crawled into bed and was almost instantly asleep , so sometime after midnight found [female] sleeping . and [female] on her knees , it found [female] dreamlessly unconscious in her white bed .
darrow did not think it necessary to answer , it was no business of his , after all . he lit a cigar and leaned back in his seat . letting his eyes take their fill of indolent pleasure . in the throes of invention she had pushed back her hat . loosening the stray lock which had invited his touch the night before .
late in december , while the villagers were eating mr. [male] 's beef . and warming themselves before mr. [female] 's coals . and reaping the fruit of laborious days in the shape of miss [female] 's various premiums for humble virtue . while the park and woodland were wrapped in snow . and the christmas bells were still ringing in the clear crisp air .
presently he espied one of the men who had robbed him watching him from another escape . and being afraid and beaten sore , he crept into the heat . and lay on the bed beside the window , after a while a breath of air came in . and junior slept the sleep of exhaustion , when he awoke it was morning . his head aching , his mouth dry .
mr. [male] had opened the dancing by leading out the wife of his principal tenant . a handsome matron , whose behavior and expression were such as to give a safe . home-like feeling to the shy and doubtful of the company . but [male] knew better than injure his chance by precipitation . he would wait until the dancing was more general , and the impulse to movement stronger .
he arrived in great good humor -- somebody had been praising his verses . and the joy of the praise overflowed on his wife . but when , pleased as any little girl with the prospect of a party and a new frock . she told him , with gleeful gratitude . of the invitation and the heavenly kindness which had rendered it possible for her to accept it .
but conscience reacts on the body . for sickness until it is obeyed , for health thereafter . the moment conscience spoke thus plainly to [male] . the little that was left of his physical endurance gave way , his illness got the upper hand . and he took to his bed -- all he could have for bed .
yes , i am sure i ought , i will begin again , you will be pleased to hear that i passed successfully my mid year examinations . and am now commencing work in the new semester , i am leaving chemistry . having completed the course in qualitative analysis -- and am entering upon the study of biology . i approach this subject with some hesitation . as i understand that we dissect angleworms and frogs .
her head rested on his arm , and his lips were pressed against her brow . i opened the man 's linen robe . and there over his heart was a dagger wound , and beneath the woman 's fair breast was a like cruel stab . through which her life had ebbed away , on the rock above was an inscription in three words . ayesha translated it , it was `` wedded in death . ''
the morning that [female] had spent with miss [female] . and the afternoon she set out to entrap [female] . were the scales of a single balance , time might never have moved . rain never have fallen , and man alone , with his schemes and ailments . was troubling nature until he saw her through a veil of tears .
[female] was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy . and several times that morning had tried to set to work , but her heart was not in it . and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with all her heart and all her might . for a while she had stood beside sonya while the [location] was being packed and tried to help . but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things .
she put the candle down , and undid her hair . roughly parting it on one side , and letting it sweep down over the further eyebrow . she fixed it in that fashion . and posed [female] , now , but gradually her smile relaxed . and a mist came to her eyes , for she had to admit that even so .
the two women had been standing in the drawing room . lady annesley seton 's hand still in the countess 's . but now , without speaking again , madalena led her visitor into the room adjoining . which was fitted up much as the room at the devonshire hotel had been for her first seance . the seeress gave herself , here at home .
the disclosure of the conspiracy followed , after i had offered my preliminary explanation . first of all , in the fewest and the plainest words , i was there present to declare . first , that my wife , then sitting by me , was the daughter of the late mr. [male] . secondly , to prove by positive facts , that the funeral which they had attended in limmeridge churchyard was the funeral of another woman . thirdly , to give them a plain account of how it had all happened .
yet [female] 's suspicions were not entirely allayed , the plan had its advantages . it was important that [male] receive certain reports . and already the hotel whispered that [male] was of the secret service . it brought him added deference . of course , but additional danger , so [male] accepted the plan .
she had been to church twice a day on each of the sundays that she had passed in littlebath . having in this matter strictly obeyed the hints which mr stumfold had given for her guidance . no doubt she had received benefit from the discourses which she had heard from that gentleman each morning . and , let [female] hope , benefit also from the much longer discourses which she had heard from mr stumfold 's curate on each evening , the rev . mr maguire was very powerful , but he was also very long .
`` time and i against any two , '' he had said to himself sometimes in relation to this business . he had been content to bide his time ; but the golden opportunity had come at last . if he failed to night , he failed forever . `` is he coming ? '' clarissa asked , rather anxiously , there was something ominous in the stillness of the place . and the absence of any sign of life except [male] 's presence .
her pale face seemed to grow paler as the morning advanced . a tiny medicine chest was open upon the dressing table , and little stoppered bottles of red lavender . sal volatile , chloroform , chlorodyne , and ether were scattered about , once my lady paused before this medicine chest . and took out the remaining bottles , half absently , perhaps , until she came to one which was filled with a thick . dark liquid , and labeled `` opium -- poison . ''
it may be that i did not , in this continued course of scribbling . consult either the interest of the public or my own . but the former had effectual means of defending themselves , and could , by their coldness . sufficiently check any approach to intrusion ; and for myself . i had now for several years dedicated my hours so much to literary labour that i should have felt difficulty in employing myself otherwise .
having been there three or four weeks it was turning colour . and the leaves and berries were wrinkled , angel took it down and crushed it into the grate . standing there , he for the first time doubted whether his course in this conjecture had been a wise . much less a generous , one , but had he not been cruelly blinded ? in the incoherent multitude of his emotions he knelt down at the bedside wet eyed . o tess , if you had only told me sooner .
she opened her eyes . her mind was in the tender state of a lately born infant 's . she was pleased with the gay but not dazzling colours of the paper . soothed by the subdued light ; and quite sufficiently amused by looking at all the objects in the room . the drawing of the ships , the festoons of the curtain .
`` but i can not say it in english , '' she said . then in french , blushing and laughing as she spoke , -- almost stammering in spite of her usual self confidence . she told him that accident had made her rich . full of money , money was a drug with her . money she knew was wanted , even for householders .
[female] was heartily sorry when the door closed ; it seemed like shutting out a friendly sunbeam . and her father , what could be the matter with him ? he was so restless ; not speaking , but starting up and then sitting down . and meddling with her irons ; he seemed so fierce , too , to judge from his face . she wondered if he disliked will being there ; or if he were vexed to find that she had not got further on with her work .
there were no names on any of the tombs , even the grandest , here and there on a woman 's grave was a hand of fatma . or a pair of the prophet 's slippers . and on those of a few men were turbans carved in marble . to tell that the dead had made pilgrimage to mecca , all faces were turned towards the sacred city . as mussulmans turn when they kneel to pray , in mosque or in desert .
the next moment mrs. [female] was rapping at the door of mrs. [female] 's room . [female] opened it and was greatly surprised at beholding her visitor . who seldom came there , mrs. [female] , however , smilingly presented her letter to mr. [male] . saying that she had business with [female] . which rendered it necessary for her to write to him , and as she did not care to have the post office clerks gossip about her writing to a gentleman .
i was not long in discovering the reason of this astonishment and admiration . for , having begun to examine things a little carefully , i discovered without difficulty that i was in the house of a kept woman . now , if there is one thing which women in society would like to see . it is the home of those women whose carriages splash their own carriages day by day . who , like them , side by side with them .
he remembered , as if something was coming back to him out of a dream . how the whimsical twistings of his sick brain had made him see two faces instead of one . yet he knew that the first picture of his mysterious assailant . the picture painted in his brain when he had tried to raise his pistol . was the right one , he had seen her dark eyes aglow .
they parted at the mansions , mrs. [female] went in after due civilities . and [female] watched the tall , lonely figure sweep up the hall to the lift . as the glass doors closed on it she had the sense of an imprisonment . the beautiful head disappeared first , still buried in the muff , the long trailing skirt followed . a woman of undefinable rarity was going up heaven ward , like a specimen in a bottle .
any one else would have hastened to receive him ; but villefort was a man of ability . and he knew this would be a sign of weakness . he made [male] wait in the ante chamber . although he had no one with him . for the simple reason that the king 's procureur always makes every one wait .
this was the best side of his character ; the worst , probably , was that which was brought into play by the fact that he was not a fool . he would have a better chance of redemption in this world . perhaps also in another -- had he been a fool , as it was . he was no fool : he was not to be done , not he . he knew , no one better , the value of a shilling .
[female] said nothing more , and her aunt also remained silent . soon afterwards , the four wheeled carriage , with the demure stable boy . came to the door , and [female] was driven up and down through the streets of perivale in a manner which was an injury to her . she knew that she was suffering an injustice . but it was one of which she could not make complaint .
in a moment there was a light step upon the stair . [male] knew it was [male] . for he soon returned with [male] , and as they passed her door she heard the [female] laugh of [female] . who was bridesmaid , in an instant they were in the parlor . throughout which a general gloom seemed to reign , perhaps it was owing to the wildness of the storm .
[male] had paused as he spoke , and eyed her with an unquiet look . conscious of some [female] which conquered yet brought no happiness , a feverish yet pleasurable excitement possessed him . a reckless mood , making him eager to obliterate the past by any rash act . any new experience which his passion brought , [male] regarded him with a wistful . almost woeful face , for one short moment ; then a strange smile broke over it .
napoleon walked about in front of his tent . looked at the fires and listened to these sounds , and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a shaggy cap . who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn himself up like a [male] pillar at sight of the emperor . [male] stopped in front of him . `` what year did you enter the service ? ''
darrow took the onslaught in silence . he might have spoken , have summoned up the usual phrases of banter and denial . he was not even certain that they might not , for the moment . have served their purpose if he could have uttered them without being seen . but he was as conscious of what had happened to his face as if he had obeyed [male] 's bidding and looked at himself in the glass .
polly , by this time , explaining to the audience , the failure of miss [female] to take her part in the duet . caught little ends of the whispers going on beneath her . such as `` perfectly exquisite , '' `` most wonderful range , '' `` shall certainly ask her to sing . '' and again she saw [female] 's beaming face . while [male] took no pains to conceal his delight .
while the colonel fought for his breath , his woodsmen remained in the offing . paralyzed into inactivity by reason of the swiftness and thoroughness of [organization] work . then [male] motioned to them to remove the wreckage . and they hastened to obey , freed from the weight on the geometric centre of his being . colonel pennington stretched his legs , rolled his head from side to side .
again the knights hurtled mightily together , and sir [male] , sir ector . and sir [male] drove at sir [male] . and so great was their force that they smote sir [male] 's horse to the ground . by ill hap , the spear of sir [male] pierced through his [male] 's shield into his side . and the head of the lance broke off and remained in the wound .
the duchess -- resplendent in purple satin and ermine . with white plumes in her bonnet , and many jewelled chains depending from her . which rattled and tinkled , in the silence of the church , every time she moved . was in a front pew on the left , ready to give her niece away . in a corresponding seat , on the opposite side , as near as possible to the bridegroom .
edna did not wish to enter , it was very [female] there on the side porch . where there were chairs , a wicker lounge . and a small table , she seated herself . for she was tired from her long tramp ; and she began to rock gently and smooth out the folds of her silk parasol . [male] drew up his chair beside her , he at once explained that the [female] woman 's offensive conduct was all due to imperfect training .
you need not have taken such trouble about accounts and expenditure . of course , whatever you have done i perfectly approve of . you say that the boy has no idea of money or its value . there is both good and evil in this , and now as to his future . i should have no objection whatever to having him attached to my legation here .
the whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment . down to the drops of april rain on the windows of the court . glittering in the rays of april sun , penned in the dock . as i again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine . were the two and thirty men and women ; some defiant .
the last trunk crashed into the baggage car . every window framed for a moment a girl 's face . and the train was gone , bates brought a great log and rolled it upon exactly the right spot on the andirons . and a great constellation of sparks thronged up the chimney . the old relic of a house—i called the establishment by many names .
20 of book xviii. , which describes the arrival of the body of the fair maiden of astolat at [male] 's court . or vii for chap , 25 of the same book . with its discourse on true love ; but the great bulk of the work has been traced chapter by chapter to the [male] of [male] and his successors , the english metrical romance [male] morte [male] of the [male] manuscript . the french romances of tristan and of [male] .
mrs. [female] sat all day in her husband 's room . but about five in the afternoon [male] fell into a deep slumber . in which mr. [male] found him at a little after six o'clock . nothing could be better than that tranquil sleep , the surgeon said . and when he was gone , mrs. [male] , who had been sitting in the room for some time .
but she turned away , and set off towards the lake , below , on the water . lanterns were coming alight , faint ghosts of warm flame floating in the pallor of the first twilight . the earth was spread with darkness , like lacquer . overhead was a pale sky , all [female] . and the lake was pale as milk in one part .
monstrous trick , that fate had played him , nemesis ! that old unhappy marriage ! and in god 's name why ? how was he to know , when he wanted [female] so violently . and she consented to be his , that she would never love him ? the tune died and was renewed , and died again , and still soames sat in the shadow . waiting for he knew not what , the [male] of fleur 's cigarette .
the place of meeting was in the palatial , but somewhat faded and gloomy apartment of an eminent member of the aesthetic body . it was no more formal an occasion than one of those weekly receptions . common among the foreign residents of [male] , at which [male] people . or disagreeable ones , as the case may be -- encounter one another with little ceremony . if anywise interested in art , a man must be difficult to please who can not find fit companionship among a crowd of persons .
`` god speed you well , '' said sir [male] , and gave the king his spear . when sir mordred heard king [male] he raised his head . then came towards the king with his sword in his hand . and there , in the shadow of the great stone , king [male] smote sir mordred under the shield .
inside they find a number of men at arms and knights with the count . i can not tell you just how many ; but they were unarmed . except eight of them who had just returned from the fight , and even they were preparing to remove their arms . but their haste was ill considered ; for now the other party make no further pretence . but without any challenge by way of warning , they brace themselves in the stirrups .
the cobb itself , its old wonders and new improvements . with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town . are what the stranger 's eye will seek ; and a very strange stranger it must be . who does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme . to make him wish to know it better , the scenes in its neighbourhood .
not for a long while , said the duke ; -- for a long while . that is , as candidates for office regard time . mr. [male] will be safe for this session at least . i doubt whether he will really attempt to carry his measure this year . he will bring it forward , and after the late division he must get his second reading .
the hope of meeting with more consideration in the family . inspirited [female] with a wish , hitherto unfelt , of contributing to the purposed entertainment . the part which she had been obliged to undertake , was too prominent to be placed in the back ground . and the whole performance must be flat , if not ridiculous , unless lady townly were a principal person . she read over , therefore , repeated , and studied the character , with an attention more alive to its meaning .
from the willow walk projected a slight wooden pier ending in a sort of pagoda like summer house . and in the pagoda a lady stood . leaning against the rail , her back to the shore . archer stopped at the sight as if he had waked from sleep . that vision of the past was a dream .
she turned from the young man , and , much as her heart yearned towards him . she would not profane that heavy parting by an embrace . or even a pressure of the hand , so soon after the semblance of such mighty love . and after it had been the impulse to so terrible a deed , they parted . in all outward show , as coldly as people part whose whole mutual intercourse has been encircled within a single hour .
and thus , with nothing settled but the determination of the lovers . [female] had left quetcham , among the heirs of art . as is the division of the promised land , each has to win his portion by hard fighting . the bestowal is after the manner of prophecy . and is a title without possession , to carry the map of an ungotten estate in your pocket is a poor sort of copyhold .
so saying , and without giving him time to answer , she bade him good night . and ran back to the house , hoping to get in as before without being seen . but to her dismay she found the door already fast . and concluded the hour had arrived when the house was shut up for the night . she rang the bell , but there was no answer .
thereupon , tholomyes lowered his voice and articulated something so mirthful . that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four mouths simultaneously , and blachevelle exclaimed . `` that is an idea , '' a smoky tap room presented itself . they entered , and the remainder of their confidential colloquy was lost in shadow . the result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which took place on the following sunday .
but he did not go so far , when he reached the abbey . he turned back and crossed westminster bridge and sat down to watch the trails of smoke behind the houses of parliament catch fire with the sunset . the slender towers were washed by a rain of golden light and licked by little flickering flames . somerset house and the bleached gray pinnacles about whitehall were floated in a luminous haze . the yellow light poured through the trees and the leaves seemed to burn with soft fires .
the [female] 's face was a study during the few moments that it took to say these words . she was dumb with amazement , instantaneously , on the first sense of relief that the disgrace had not been what she supposed . followed a new wrath , if possible hotter than the first ; not so much scorn . but a bitterer anger , `` marry ! marry that indian ! '' she cried , as soon as she found voice .
they ran on , regardless of stitches and pains in the side . on along the river bank to where the concourse of people was gathered . there was no great length of way between the butter cross and the harbour . in five minutes the breathless girls were close together in the best place they could get for seeing . on the outside of the crowd ; and in as short a time longer they were pressed inwards .
mrs. [female] arundel only opened her brown eyes to their widest extent . and stared at her husband , captain arundel was very careful in the adjustment of his sheet of paper . and began his letter with an air of resolution . he wrote as much as this with great promptitude , and then , with his elbow on the table . fell to staring at his pretty young wife and drumming his fingers on his chin .
without waiting to inquire the reason , ranald wheeled his team . gave the stump a half turn . released his chain , and drove off from the pile , to find [male] still busy hooking his chain to his whiffletree . [male] had had the same difficulty in freeing his chain as ranald . but instead of trying to detach it from the stump , he had unhooked the other end .
today was a great day for him . the anniversary of his coronation , before dawn he had slept for a few hours . and refreshed , vigorous , and in good spirits , he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds . he sat motionless , looking at the heights visible above the mist . and his cold face wore that special look of confident , self complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily in love .
the upshot of it all was this , that as no lorna came to me . except in dreams or fancy , and as my life was not worth living without constant sign of her . forth i must again to find her . and say more than a man can tell , therefore , without waiting longer for the moving of the spring . dressed i was in grand attire ( so far as i had gotten it ) .
he had that splendid pallor that gives something of the majesty of marble to the ardent races of the south . his vigorous form was tightly clad in a brown coloured doublet ; a small chiselled poniard hung against his left thigh . and he cast round laughing looks showing his white teeth . they said that a polish princess having heard him sing one night on the beach at biarritz . where he mended boats , had fallen in love with him .
the pageant was magnificent , beautiful weather favored the solemnity . [male] had regained all his youth , all his good humor . he appeared to be transfigured ; hearts seemed to smile on him like the sun . amongst this noisy crowd of courtiers and worshipers . who did not appear to remember they had conducted to the scaffold at whitehall the father of the new king .
with this sickness , this deathly feeling of loneliness and heartache . there had entered into jan now a strange sensation that was almost excitement . an eagerness to fasten the dogs in their traces . to hurry on , in spite of his exhaustion , to that place which [male] had told him of . prince [male] , and to free himself there .
above the youth 's inspired and flashing eyes i see the motley mocking fool's cap rise ! fortunately he had not been allowed to bring his disappointment into his dear sue 's life by involving her in this collapse . and the painful details of his awakening to a sense of his limitations should now be spared her as far as possible . after all , she had only known a little part of the miserable struggle in which he had been engaged thus unequipped . poor , and unforeseeing , he always remembered the appearance of the afternoon on which he awoke from his dream .
upstairs in her sitting room , that afternoon . she was thinking of these things , the morning mists had turned to rain . compelling the postponement of an excursion in which the whole party were to have joined . [organization] , with her governess , had been despatched in the motor to do some shopping at francheuil . and [male] had promised darrow to join him .
but the afternoon wore on , and it became time to leave the gardens . as they drove from waterloo to chelsea , [location] began to have some compunction about her father . which , together with the opening of offices and the need of working in them on monday . made it difficult to plan another festival for the following day . mr. [male] had taken their absence .
under the first drops of the rain most of the women had come huddling down for shelter inside . panic had presently driven down the rest , yet on one roof one woman still was . a strange , drenched figure , she stood bright eyed in the dimness . alone , as it was well she should be in her great hour . draining the lees of such homage as had come to no woman in history recorded .
governesses dine , it appeared , only to fill an unexpected place . or make a decorous entry afterward , to play accompaniments , fortunately [female] . in a pinched little soprano , not nearly so pretty as her silver ripple of talk . it was when the party had settled down to bridge and i was standing out . that i ventured to go up to her as she sat knitting by a window .
it had a soothing happy influence upon them . between the shadows of the trees there stole glimmerings of light from the adjacent houses . a low murmur of children at play . and of others enjoying their walk , floated around them . they were so alone , and yet in the midst of the bright and living world .
between that time and dinner i sat quiet enough even to please [female] . i was thinking over the beautiful old bible story , which latterly had so vividly impressed itself on my mind . thinking of [male] , as he walked `` by the stone ezel , '' with the shepherd lad , who was to be king of [male] , i wondered whether he would have loved him . and seen the same future perfection in him , had [male] .
he left her resignedly ; he had got what he wanted . fortunately he was ignorant that half an hour later , going home with her father and feeling him near . the poor girl , in spite of her sudden declaration of courage . began to tremble again , her father said nothing ; but she had an idea his eyes were fixed upon her in the darkness . mrs. [female] also was silent ; [female] had told her that her niece preferred .
it gave her a certain immediate and unthinking pleasure to sit still by his side and know he was full of her . then suddenly , with a start , she remembered her duty . she was a married woman , and she ought not to do it . quickly , with a startled air , she withdrew her hand . bertram gazed down at her for a second , half taken aback by her hurried withdrawal .
when that sternly magnificent old lady , mrs. [female] . whose ancestors had been welsh kings in the time of the romans . when she should hear this story , the roof of the old hall would hardly be able to hold her wrath and her dismay ! the old kings had died away , but the fletchers , and the vaughans . of whom she had been one , -- and the whartons remained , a peculiar people in an age that was then surrendering itself to quick perdition .
[male] , from now on , reflected this attitude toward the senator . and , feeling so grateful toward him , she began to talk more freely , they came to be on such good terms that he gave her a little leather picture case from his dresser which he had observed her admiring . every time she came he found excuse to detain her . and soon discovered that , for all her soft girlishness , there lay deep seated in her a conscious deprecation of poverty and a shame of having to own any need . he honestly admired her for this , and , seeing that her clothes were poor and her shoes worn .
no man can escape this vitiating effect of an offence against his own sentiment of right . and the effect was the stronger in [male] because of that very need of self respect which . while his conscience was still at ease , was one of his best safeguards . self accusation was too painful to him -- he could not face it . he must persuade himself that he had not been very much to blame .
she did not wish to hear more , what she had heard was more than enough . not that she really believed that m'barka could see into the future . but because of the `` dark man , '' any fortune teller might introduce a dark man into the picture of a fair girl 's destiny . but the allusions were so marked that victoria 's vague unrestfulness became distress . she tried to encourage herself by thinking of maïeddine 's dignified attitude .
just as there are bigwigs elsewhere , there are big mitres in the church . these are the bishops who stand well at court , who are rich , well endowed . skilful , accepted by the world , who know how to pray , no doubt . but who know also how to beg , who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person . who are connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy .
for a time master stickles 's authority . and manner of levying duties , had not been taken kindly by the people round our neighbourhood . the manors of east lynn and west lynn . and even that of woolhanger -- although just then all three were at issue about some rights of wreck . and the hanging of a sheep stealer ( a man of no great eminence .
doctor , captain , if you are ill . it will not reflect upon your honor as a man to tell me all . in fact , i ought to hear the other side , doctor . good night , then , captain , i am afraid , i can be of no further use in this case , doctor . far from it , but it is too bad we can not be friends , good night , [male] .
i looked at the book on the table . the book that he had been reading when i entered the room . these sophistical confidences of his were nothing but [male] at second hand , good ! if he talked false [male] , nothing was left for me but to talk genuine pratolungo . i let myself go -- i was just in the humour for it .
he looked out of the window in the direction of the woodman 's gaze . the tree was a tall elm , familiar to him from childhood . which stood at a distance of two thirds its own height from the front of south 's dwelling . whenever the wind blew , as it did now . the tree rocked , naturally enough ; and the sight of its motion and sound of its sighs had gradually bred the terrifying illusion in the woodman 's mind that it would descend and kill him .
to fall into clean water is not [male] , even when one is trout fishing ; but to be clad in white pants . and suddenly drop nearly knee deep in the lap of mother earth is quite a different thing . i hastily picked up the children , and threw them upon the bank . and then wrathfully strode out myself , and tried to shake myself as i have seen a newfoundland dog do . the shake was not a success -- it caused my trouser leg to flap dismally about my ankles .
by the time that we had finished this most refreshing bath the sun was setting . indeed , when we got back to the big cave it had already set . the cave itself was full of people gathered round fires . for several more had now been lighted -- and eating their evening meal by their lurid light . and by that of various lamps which were set about or hung upon the walls .
i felt , of course , at the time . that this temporising on my part would probably end in bringing [male] here in a state of virtuous indignation , banging doors . but then , the other course of proceeding might end in bringing sir [male] here in a state of virtuous indignation . banging doors also , and of the two indignations and bangings i preferred [female] 's . because i was used to her , [female] i despatched the letter by return of post .
all men are good and wise , it is only we . equality 7 2521 , we alone who were born with a curse . for we are not like our brothers , and as we look back upon our life . we see that it has ever been thus and that it has brought [male] step by step to our last . supreme transgression , our crime of crimes hidden here under the ground .
mademoiselle reentered and lit a candle , [female] 's letter was on the floor . she stooped and picked it up , it was crumpled and damp with tears . mademoiselle smoothed the letter out , restored it to the envelope . and replaced it in the table drawer . one morning on his way into town mr. pontellier stopped at the house of his old friend and family physician , doctor mandelet .
she broke from him trembling , blushed and turned aside , hardly knowing how things had advanced to this . [male] drove off , kissing his hand to her , and waving it to [female] who was visible through the window . her father returned the surgeon 's action with a great flourish of his own hand and a satisfied smile . this visit was a type of many which followed it during the long summer days of that year . [female] was borne along upon a stream of reasonings .
she followed him out of the sleigh and waited while he hitched the horse . a party of four -- [female] , [female] , [female] . and another girl -- drew up beside them with a mighty jingle of bells . there were quite a crowd already , bundled in fur or sheepskin . shouting and calling to each other as they moved through the snow , which was now so thick that people could scarcely be distinguished a few yards away .
she had hitherto refused to make the promise which her husband exacted . but nevertheless , she was minded to obey him , had he included in his demand any requirement that she should receive no letter from colonel osborne . she would not have opened this one , but nothing had been said about letters . and she would not shew herself to be afraid , so she read the note . and then sent it down to be put on mr. [male] 's table in an envelope addressed to him .
the child was making them drag him along . non passibus cequis , as [male] says . and stumbling at every moment , to the great indignation of his mother . it is true that he was looking at his cake more than at the pavement . some serious motive , no doubt , prevented his biting it .
javert was enjoying himself , the meshes of his net were stoutly knotted . he was sure of success ; all he had to do now was to close his hand . accompanied as he was , the very idea of resistance was impossible . however vigorous , energetic , and desperate [male] might be , javert advanced slowly , sounding , searching on his way all the nooks of the street like so many pockets of thieves . when he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there .
as soon , then , as i and my comrades made our appearance . all those that were in hiding seeing [female] came and joined us , it was now the time when the city gates are shut . and there was no one to be seen in all the space outside , when we were collected together we debated whether it would be better first to go for [male] . or to make prisoners of the moorish rowers who rowed in the vessel . but while we were still uncertain our renegade came up asking [male] what kept us .
`` if you have faith enough , and think hard enough , you can think anything until it comes true , '' he had told himself more than once , and he knew yellow bird possessed that illimitable faith . and that behind her divination lay generations and centuries of an unbreakable certainty in the power of mind over matter . he realized his own limitations , but a mysterious voice in the still night seemed whispering to him that in the crude wisdom of yellow bird 's brain lay the secret to strange achievement . and that on this night her mind might perform for him what he .
one main idea possessed her : she must get away from home . she must assert herself at once or perish , `` very well , '' she would say . `` then i must go , '' to remain , she felt , was to concede everything . and she would have to go tomorrow , it was clear it must be tomorrow . if she delayed a day she would delay two days .
we are far from believing , however , that the new pope of the fools understood both the sentiments which he felt and the sentiments which he inspired . the spirit which was lodged in this failure of a body had . necessarily , something incomplete and deaf about it . thus , what he felt at the moment was to him . absolutely vague , indistinct , and confused , only joy made itself felt , only pride dominated .
it fairly sways with a single soul , a dark-haired beauty dances by and there is a half gasping sound as the ripple surges forward and some one sleeker than the rest darts out and cuts in . then when the six-foot girl ( brought by kaye in your class . and to whom he has been trying to introduce you all evening ) gallops by . the line surges back and the groups face about and become intent on far corners of the hall . for kaye , anxious and perspiring , appears elbowing through the crowd in search of familiar faces .
when his daughter had said good night , [female] extinguished the light . and slipping the big gun inside his shirt went to sit outside the cabin door with his pipe . an hour passed , [male] was fast asleep . and still the man sat smoking , a half hour more went by . suddenly the pipe was laid aside , and [male] 's hand crept inside his shirt to find the butt of the revolver .
sir [male] owned considerable property in the north . certainly , and he had often before gone there alone and stayed away a week at a time . but it seemed so very strange that circumstances should have arisen between five and six o'clock in the morning that compelled him to start in this extreme hurry . vainly she tried to shake off an unaccustomed feeling of nervousness . she was trembling from head to foot .
i think if you had loved me when i wanted . if i would looked up one day , and seen your eyes . and found my wild sick blasphemous prayer granted , and your brown face , that 's full of pity and wise , flushed suddenly . the white godhead in new fear intolerably so struggling , and so shamed ; most holy and far . if you would come all too near , if earth had seen earth 's lordliest wild limbs tamed .
he helped [male] up the stairs to where the nurse stood waiting . and then went on into his own bedroom , he surveyed it for the first time since his return with a sense of permanency and intimacy . here , from now on , was to center his life , from this bed he would rise in the morning . to go back to it at night , from this room he would go out to fight for place again . and for the old faith in him , for confiding eyes and the clasp of friendly hands .
in juxtaposition with troy , oak had a melancholy tendency to look like a candle beside gas . and ill at ease , he went out again . thinking he would go home ; for , under the circumstances . he had no heart for the scene in the barn . at the door he paused for a moment .
[male] , now one of the great unemployed , had been seen near the hospital where the injured man lay . but he had taken the alarm and departed without inquiring for the invalid 's health . or else his being in that neighbourhood was a coincidence , the name of the man [male] was [male] . and [location] was given as his address , he was between thirty five and forty . and according to the arrested dragoman was `` not a gentleman , but a tourist . ''
corn was to be ground while yet it could be carried to the distant mill . the great racks for oat cake , that swung at the top of the kitchen . had to be filled , and last of all came the pig killing , when the second frost set in . for up in the north there is an idea that the ice stored in the first frost will melt . and the meat cured then taint ; the first frost is good for nothing but to be thrown away .
she remembered the simple delight expressed on the round . good humored face of [female] pavlovna at their meetings . she remembered their secret confabulations about the invalid . their plots to draw him away from the work which was forbidden him . and to get him out of doors ; the devotion of the youngest boy .
`` if you do , salome marsh , i will never forgive you , '' said [female] , her harsh face dark with anger . and then , not trusting herself to discuss the subject any longer , she went out . salome dissolved into her ready tears , and cried most of the night , but her resolution did not fail . go to church she would , for that dear baby 's sake .
she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with . and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever . which , finally settling in her legs , had made her for the present a cripple . she had come to bath on that account , and was now in lodgings near the hot baths . living in a very humble way , unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant .
let [female] remark , by the way , that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred . this hatred would involve the hatred of the arts , nevertheless , in churchmen . luxury is wrong , except in connection with representations and ceremonies . it seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about them . an opulent priest is a contradiction , the priest must keep close to the poor .
i returned to the hotel at welmingham so jaded in body and mind . so weakened and depressed by all that i had gone through , as to be quite unfit to endure the local gossip about the inquest . and to answer the trivial questions that the talkers addressed to me in the coffee room . i withdrew from my scanty dinner to my cheap garret chamber to secure myself a little quiet . and to think undisturbed of [male] and [male] , if i had been a richer man i would have gone back to [location] .
the prisoner 's cries became more and more terrible , when [male] had satisfied himself that [male] had reached the bottom of the staircase . he inserted the key in the first lock . it was then that he heard the hoarse . choking voice of the king , crying out , in a frenzy of rage . `` help , help , i am the king . ''
how often , while women and girls sit warm at snug fire sides . their hearts and imaginations are doomed to divorce from the comfort surrounding their persons . forced out by night to wander through dark ways , to dare stress of weather . to contend with the snow blast , to wait at lonely gates and stiles in wildest storms . watching and listening to see and hear the father , the son , the husband coming home .
he listened till her footsteps were silent , trying to tell from the sound of the shutting door which room she had gone into . then wandered aimlessly away through the hall again , and found himself back in the top garden . scrap from her window saw him there . she saw lotty and rose sitting on the end parapet . where she would have liked to have been , and she saw mr. [male] buttonholing briggs and evidently telling him to story of the oleander tree in the middle of the garden .
`` never heard of her , '' miss white , who had been district nursing for fourteen years . made effort to recall the name , `` she had a hemorrhage , you say ? '' she did not wait for an answer , but went up the steps ahead of me . and envy filled me as i followed her into the room where she was to find her patient . professionally miss white was one person , socially another , off duty she was slow and shy and consciously awkward .
across the swing bridge , along the pier , -- and they stood breathless by a magnificent dock . where hundreds of ships lay motionless during the process of loading and unloading . the cries of the sailors , the variety of languages used by the passers-by . and the entire novelty of the sight compared with anything which [female] had ever seen . made her feel most helpless and forlorn ; and she clung to her young guide as to one who alone by his superior knowledge could interpret between her and the new race of men by whom she was surrounded .
the more the door resisted him , the more dangerous and imminent became that bloody conspiracy against his life . force of police arriving . he recognized in them the conspirators . and laid about him hoarsely , fiercely , staringly , convulsively , foamingly , a humble machine . familiar to the conspirators and called by the expressive name of stretcher .
remembering mr. [male] 's caution to me . i subjected mrs. [female] to a severe scrutiny at certain intervals for the next three or four days . i over and over again entered the room softly and suddenly , but i never found her out in any suspicious action . lady [female] , who watched her as attentively as i did . discovered nothing either , i never detected a sign of the medicine bottles being tampered with .
that was what the girl had called it once upon a time . when sobbing out the shame and the agony of it to herself . that was before [female] had come to leaven the drab of her life . but the hell was still there , one would not have guessed its existence , standing at the bald top of [organization] ridge this wonderful thirtieth day of may . in the whiteness of winter one could look off over a hundred square miles of freezing forest and swamp and river country .
it must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that toy shop . lighted up by fire pots and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the drinking shop . [female] raised her eyes ; she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun . she heard the unprecedented words , it is for you ', . she stared at him ; she stared at the doll .
will evans , who was an especial chum of his , ran down to the water 's edge . bless me , win , where did you come from ? come right in . we have not had tea yet , bring your friend too , he added . becoming conscious that winslow 's friend was a mighty pretty girl , winslow 's face was crimson . he avoided [female] 's eye .
all is not there ; the true all remains without ; what is the use of busying oneself over that detail , man ? man suffers , that is quite possible ; but look at aldebaran rising ! the mother has no more milk , the new born babe is dying . i know nothing about that , but just look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of wood cells of the pine presents under the microscope ! compare the most beautiful mechlin lace to that if you can !
as you read lord [male] chronicles you might come to the conclusion that in the whorl of that new life of his sir [male] had entirely forgotten the happenings in his cornish home and the woman he had loved . who so readily had believed him guilty of the slaying of her brother . you might believe this until you come upon the relation of how he found one day among some english seamen brought captive to algiers by [male] . who was become his own second in command -- a young cornish lad from helston named [male] . whose father he had known , he took this lad home with him to the fine palace which he inhabited near the bab el oueb .
`` the night for dreaming , but the morn for seeing . '' and so ranald found it ; for with the cold , calm light of the morning . he found himself facing his battle with small sense of victory in his blood . he knew he had to deal that morning with the crisis of his life . upon the issue his whole future would turn , but his heart without haste or pause preserved its even beat .
he had already again and again told the tale of fotheringay so far as he had seen it in this very parlour . at first he had hardly found himself able to speak of it without tears . he had described the scene he had looked upon when . in the rush that had been made towards the hall after [male] 's head had been shown at the window . he had found a place , and had been forced along , partly with his will and partly against it .
this long letter is because i am writing before breakfast , oh , the beautiful vine leaves ! the house is covered with a vine , i looked out earlier . and mrs. [female] was already in the garden . she evidently loves it , no wonder she sometimes looks tired . she was watching the large red poppies come out , then she walked off the lawn to the meadow .
so mr. [male] got into his gig , and drove himself into [male] . passing very close to mr. [male] 's house on his road . he drove at once to mr. [male] 's office . and on arriving there found that the attorney was not at that moment within , but mr. [male] was within . would mr. [male] see mr. [male] ? now , seeing mr. [male] was a very different thing from seeing mr. [male] .
she was quite determined that she would never go back to him . and there had come to her a doubt whether it would not be expedient that she should live abroad so as to be out of the way of persecution from her husband . lord brentford was in great wrath . and lord [male] had once or twice hinted that perhaps he had better `` see '' mr. [male] . the amenities of such an interview , as this would be , had up to the present day been postponed .
but the laundress could tell mr. [female] very little , she did not know whither mr. [male] had gone . or when he was likely to return , he was one of the most uncertingest gentlemen she had to do for . and he had been out of town a great deal lately . which was not to be wondered at , considering the trying hot weather , when it was not to be supposed that gentlefolks as was free to do what they pleased would stay in [location] . it was hard enough upon working people with five children to wash and mend and cook for .
he paused , holding her by the hand and thinking of another question which he longed to put to her . considering whether he would ask her that question or not , he hardly knew whether he were entitled to ask it . whether or no the asking of it would be ungenerous , she had said that she would tell him everything . as she had told everything to her mother . `` of course , '' he said , `` i have no right to expect to know anything of your future intentions ? ''
he himself never gives an order . the noncommissioned officers perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers . but they already give commands , an officer still less often acts directly himself . but commands still more frequently , a general does nothing but command the troops . indicates the objective , and hardly ever uses a weapon himself .
table , and i went to take the potatoes out o ', th ', pot , but oh ! [male] , th water had boiled away . and they were all a nasty brown mess . as smelt through all the house , he said nought , and were very gentle , but oh ! [male] , i cried so that afternoon .
as for [female] , her anxiety under this suspense was . of course , more painful than [female] 's , but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing . and between herself and [female] , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of [female] . express her impatience for his arrival , or even require [male] to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used .
miss stackpole , in this undertaking , appeared to shrink from no effort . resorting largely , whenever the opportunity offered , to the natural expedient of interrogation . on the following day the weather was bad , and in the afternoon the young man . by way of providing indoor amusement , offered to show her the pictures . [female] strolled through the long gallery in his society .
the rain fell heavily on the roof , and pattered on the ground . and dripped among the evergreens and the leafless branches of the trees . the rain fell heavily , drearily , it was a night of tears . if [male] had not decided against falling in love with pet . if he had had the weakness to do it .
heavily they climbed up , and warily made their descent of rocky steeps . passing through boggy places or splashing in clear streams which issued from springs in the mountain side or fell from some distant height . then climbing again only to wind about and again descend , often the way was rough with boulders that had never been blasted out . sometimes steeply shelving where the gorge was deepest and the precipice sheerest . past all dangers the girl drove with skilful hand .
one sculptor there was , an englishman , endowed with a beautiful fancy . and possessing at his fingers ends the capability of doing beautiful things . he was a quiet , simple , elderly personage , with eyes brown and bright . under a slightly impending brow , and a grecian profile , such as he might have cut with his own chisel . he had spent his life , for forty years .
captain [female] 's `` few little things '' turned out to be a most interesting collection of curios , hideous , quaint and beautiful . and almost every one had some striking story attached to it . [female] never forgot the delight with which she listened to those old tales that moonlit evening by that enchanted driftwood fire . while the silver sea called to them through the open window and sobbed against the rocks below them .
it might have been supposed that [female] had travelled too , since she had found the pointless conversation of mr. [male] perfectly wearisome . but to most mortals there is a stupidity which is unendurable and a stupidity which is altogether acceptable . else , indeed , what would become of social bonds ? captain [male] 's stupidity was delicately scented . carried itself with `` style , '' talked with a good accent . and was closely related to sir [male] , [male] found it quite agreeable and caught many of its phrases .
she raised her eyebrows slightly , but thanked him and said she would consider it an honor . his face grew hot and his heart cold with the fancy that there was in her eyes a gleam which said . `` i pity you , poor fellow . '' notwithstanding his strange misgiving and the fact that his pride had sustained quite a perceptible shock . he drove with them to the station .
picture me then idle , basking , plump , and happy . stretched on a cushioned deck , warmed with constant [male] , rocked by breezes indolently soft . however , it can not be concealed that , in that case , i must somehow have fallen overboard . or that there must have been wreck at last , i too well remember a time . a long time -- of cold , of danger , of contention .
this was on tuesday , the 22nd june , and the trial was to be commenced on the following thursday . and there was present in the room , very conspicuously , an old heavy grey great coat . as to which mr. [male] had instructed mr. [male] that evidence was forthcoming . if needed , to prove that that coat was lying on the night of the murder in a downstairs room in the house in which yosef mealyus was then lodging . the reader will remember the history of the coat .
one action of hers , however , brought him to full cognition . her face being reflected towards him as she sat . he could perceive that she was amusing herself by artificially producing in each cheek the dimple before alluded to . a curious accomplishment of which she was [male] . effecting it by a momentary suction , it seemed to him for the first time that the dimples were far oftener absent from her face during his intercourse with her nowadays than they had been in the earlier weeks of their acquaintance .
nevertheless there is a way , which every soul can find out for itself . even the most rebellious , the most darkened with crime and tormented by remorse , in that way i have walked . and , self forgiven and self absolved , i know that if she were to return once more and appear to me . even here where her ashes are -- i know that her divine eyes would no longer refuse to look into mine . since the sorrow which seemed eternal and would have slain me to see would not now be in them .
but even now , after this great escape , what was to be done ? as to [female] . she had felt the absolute necessity of being obedient to her friends . with the consent of course of her mother . during the great tribulation of her family , things were so bad that she had not the heart to make them worse by giving any unnecessary trouble as to herself . having resolved , -- and having made her mother so understand , -- that on one point she would guide herself by her own feelings .
`` ah , can you ? '' said tess . awake to the new value of this locality , so the two forces were at work here as everywhere . the inherent will to enjoy , and the circumstantial will against enjoyment . [female] 's will had a method of assisting itself by taking from her pocket as the afternoon wore on a pint bottle corked with white rag . from which she invited tess to drink , tess 's unassisted power of dreaming .
he bore her to the shore and left her safe there . and plunged in again , crying to her , over his shoulder : `` i will bring back the others ! '' and she stood dripping , gazing after him , sobbing and wringing her hands . but filled with wild admiration and amaze , the bride flung herself upon his body . shrieking and kissing him , the people who had run up crowded about in senseless excitement and would have kept all air away .
and now they were in the tunnel , -- and now they were in liverpool . and she must rouse herself from the torpor of mind and body which was creeping over her . the result of much anxiety and fatigue . and several sleepless nights , she asked a policeman the way to milk house yard . and following his directions with the savoir faire of a town bred girl .
at eight o'clock he was still at work . writing with a good deal of inconvenience upon little squares of paper . with a big book open on his knees , when madame magloire entered . according to her wont , to get the silver ware from the cupboard near his bed . a moment later , the bishop , knowing that the table was set .
the next evening feversham crossed to calais , it was a night as wild as that on which durrance had left england . and , like durrance , feversham had a friend to see him off . for the last thing which his eyes beheld as the packet swung away from the pier . was the face of lieutenant sutch beneath a gas lamp . the lieutenant maintained his position after the boat had passed into the darkness and until the throb of its paddles could no longer be heard .
in his younger days , sir [male] had been a floor walker of no mean caliber . a touch of the professional still lingered in his brisk movements , he preceded [male] upstairs with the restrained suavity that can be learned in no other school . they parted from mr. [male] on the first landing . but [male] could still feel those eyes , the policeman 's stare had been of the sort that turns corners . goes upstairs , and pierces walls .
the opportunity for a private conversation with [female] did not occur immediately . for ten minutes he remained alone on the stage . absorbing abusive tuition from mr. [male] : and at the end of that period a further ten minutes was occupied with the rehearsing of the number with the leading lady and the rest of the male chorus . when , finally , a roar from the back of the auditorium announced the arrival of mr. [male] and at the same time indicated mr. [male] 's desire that the stage should be cleared and the rehearsal proper begin . a wan smile of recognition and a faint `` what ho ! ''
he took the stone out of his pocket . tied it to one end of the string . made a noose on the ether end , slipped it about the dog 's neck . and without warning , picked up the dog and stone at once , and dropped them over the pier . the old creature gave a piteous cry as it descended .
`` oh , you must not ask me that -- i can not tell -- i sha not tell -- '' and seizing her portfolio [female] started off toward the house . thinking possibly she should be pursued , but she was not , during the reading of the journal [female] 's heart seemed to go through a benumbing process . which rendered it perfectly palsied , no emotion either of love or anger did he feel toward [female] . she was nought to him , and how did the knowledge that [male] loved him affect him ?
the next event that occurred was of so singular a nature that it might have caused me a feeling of superstitious surprise . if my mind had not been fortified by principle against any pagan weakness of that sort . the uneasy sense of something wrong in the family which had made me wish myself away from blackwater park . was actually followed , strange to say , by my departure from the house , it is true that my absence was for a temporary period only . but the coincidence was , in my opinion , not the less remarkable on that account .
from the mysterious rounded back of his car [male] drew a tiny stove . to be heated by a can of solidified alcohol , a frying pan that was rather large for dolls but rather small for square fingered hands . a jar of bacon , eggs in a bag . a coffee pot , a can of condensed milk . and a litter of unsorted tin plates and [location] cups .
her avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself . she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes . till , on entering the room , the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had never seen before . with a look of much respect , he immediately rose . and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as `` mr. [male] , '' with the embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologize for his appearance there .
through this repulsive slang , marius understood that gendarmes or the police had come near apprehending these two children . and that the latter had escaped , they plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him . and there created , for a few minutes , in the gloom , a sort of vague white spot , then disappeared . he was about to pursue his way , when his eye lighted on a little grayish package lying on the ground at his feet . he stooped and picked it up , it was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers .
just as in mr. [male] 's most poetic drama we are bewitched by the wild huntress sitting at the feet of her lord . and admire her chiefly because we know that only that one man upon all the earth could have had power to tame her . to any one who had known olivia 's secret , there could have been no sadder spectacle than this of her decay . the mind and body decayed together , bound by a mysterious sympathy . all womanly roundness disappeared from the spare figure , and mrs. [female] 's [female] dresses hung about her in loose folds .
water was heated upon oil stoves set about here and there , and there was a brave array of scrubbing brushes . cloths , soap , and even sand and soda . for it had been decided and manifested by the usual sign and no contrary minded and it was a vote that the dirt was to come off , whether the paint came with it or not . each of the fifteen women present selected a block of seats . preferably one in which her own was situated , and all fell busily to work .
i leave it to any man to judge what difficulties presented to my view . i was away from my native country , at a distance prodigious . and the return to me unpassable , i lived very well . but in a circumstance insufferable in itself . if i had discovered myself to my mother .
dunyasha , the nurse , and the other maids could not say in how far mademoiselle bourienne 's statement was correct . alpatych was not at home , he had gone to the police . neither could the architect [male] ivanovich . who on being sent for came in with sleepy eyes , tell princess [male] anything . with just the same smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of his own .
to his inquiry if she were hurt she made some incoherent reply to the effect that she did not know . the damage in other respects was little or none . the phaeton was righted , mrs. [female] placed in it . and the reins given to the servant , it appeared that she had been deceived by the removal of the house . imagining the gap caused by the demolition to be the opening of the road .
in a few minutes , following the lamps of the mutes . which , held out from the body as a bearer holds water in a vessel . had the appearance of floating down the darkness by themselves . we came to a stair which led [female] to she's ante room . the same that billali had crept up upon on all fours on the previous day .
how [female] got over her confusion [female] never saw . for he had enough to do to get over his own , he involuntarily deserted [male] and began talking very fast to sir [male] . sir [male] did not once look at miss thorne . but walked back towards the house with mr gresham , sulky enough in temper . but still making some effort to do the fine gentleman , [female] , glad to be left alone .
no matter how beautiful or brilliant a girl may be , the reputation of not being frequently cut in on makes her position at a dance unfortunate . perhaps boys prefer her company to that of the butterflies with whom they dance a dozen times an but . youth in this jazz nourished generation is temperamentally restless , and the idea of fox trotting more than one full fox trot with the same girl is distasteful . not to say odious , when it comes to several dances and the intermissions between she can be quite sure that a young man . once relieved , will never tread on her wayward toes again .
mme , [female] drew the dish toward her . skillfully detached the two great [female] feet , which she placed upon her husband 's plate . cut off the neck , which with the head she put on one side for herself . raised the wing for [female] , and then returned the bird otherwise intact to the servant who had brought it in . who disappeared with it before the musketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment produces upon faces .
at the moment of his departure from the rocks . any one who had been there might have heard him singing , in an undertone . the air of [male] , thesampson of the present day is almost a city . thesampson of forty years since was almost a village . when the winter evenings were ended and spring had come .
mr. [male] was particularly pleased : he had been sighing and longing to do the baron at ecclesford . had grudged every rant of lord ravenshaw 's . and been forced to re rant it all in his own room , the storm through baron [male] was the height of his theatrical ambition . and with the advantage of knowing half the scenes by heart already . he did now , with the greatest alacrity , offer his services for the part .
well , you see , i do not like really nice men , so that makes it agreeable all around . if it were only art or music or something feminine . but that awful laboratory , how can a lady poison poor , innocent little monkeys ? if i were a lady i would dine with monkeys ... do you know what the word means , [male] ? in anglo saxon times lady meant one who gives loaves ', .
`` he has seen him , '' said [male] . in a low tone , to [male] , they had reached the ladder which led to the boat . [male] winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them . at this moment [male] perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty . and hastening his steps , as if to reach the other side of the port .
by two in the morning , sir [male] in the inn room . close by the fireside , for it was cold at that hour among the fens of kettley . by his elbow stood a pottle of spiced ale . he had taken off his visored headpiece , and sat with his bald head and thin . dark visage resting on one hand , wrapped warmly in a sanguine coloured cloak .
no more contempt for her , -- no more talk about the chivalric ! henceforward she must feel humiliated and disgraced in his sight . but when should she see him ? her heart leaped up in apprehension at every ring of the door bell . and yet when it fell down to calmness , she felt strangely saddened and sick at heart at each disappointment . it was very evident that her father expected to see him .
that was the evening 's first shock , the next came after the second act . entering the green room he found it more thronged than usual . and at the far end with climene , over whom he was bending from his fine height . his eyes intent upon her face . what time his smiling lips moved in talk .
dearest , be happy when you get this : and , when you can . come and give my happiness its rest , till then it is a watchman on the lookout . now why , i want to know , beloved , was i so specially `` good '' to you in my last ? i have been quite as good to you fifty times before . if such a thing can be from me to you .
so i will , at once , poor little girl , it will be a sad going home for her . i am afraid , and [male] opened his desk . as if writing to [male] had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks before . the letter went very soon , however , and was promptly answered , for [male] was homesick . and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner , the correspondence flourished famously .
she withdrew her hands sharply , looked up at him and then for no reason at all laughed . how absurd it all was , it was easy to be angry with him when he was at the quadrant and she at galvin house . but with him before her , looking down at her with eyes that were smilingly confident and gravely deferential by turn . she found her anger and good resolutions disappear . `` i know you are going to bully me , patricia . ''
it was usual for ladies who received in the evenings to wear what were called `` simple dinner dresses '' : a close fitting armour of whale boned silk , slightly open in the neck . with lace ruffles filling in the crack . and tight sleeves with a flounce uncovering just enough wrist to show an etruscan gold bracelet or a velvet band . but madame [location] , heedless of tradition .
jon answered with his kiss , and very soon , a flushed , distracted looking youth could have been seen . as they say -- leaping from the train and hurrying along the platform . searching his pockets for his ticket , when at last she rejoined him on the towing path a little beyond [male] lock he had made an effort . and regained some measure of equanimity , if they had to part . he would not make a scene , a breeze by the bright river threw the white side of the willow leaves up into the sunlight .
he started back , dazed , what manner of man . he wondered , was he ? a coward . piling profligacy on poltroonery ? or a hero . claiming exemption from moral law ? what was done could not be undone ; but it could be righted . he drew off from the little finger of his left hand that iron ring which .
but her spleen against its helpless object was redoubled . and she sent her a message . by [female] , to order that she would complain of a sore throat . as an excuse for not quitting her room , nor expecting any of the ladies to visit her . yet charged her to be careful , at the same time , to say , that it was very slight .
the morning of november the fifteenth dawned full of promise . for three days previously the toe of cornwall had been victimized by sea mists . accompanied by a lashing rain from the south west , and the time had hung heavily upon the hands of mr. [male] . he appreciated now to the full how he had cut himself adrift from his whole past . and the knowledge that even his address was known to no living soul gave him a curious and chilling sense of isolation .
they are strangely contrasting -- [male] and [male] . that is , so far as outward and physical appearance is concerned , but of certain inward sympathies . certain personal standards of life , certain intellectual acceptances and rejections . they have far more in common than they imagine , and to find this basis upon which friendship might take root is a desire that sprang into life upon seeing them together . should they ever be friends , they would be forever friends .
she tried , indeed , hard to win back the favour she had lost . but the very means she took were blunders , and only made it seem to her as if she could never again do right in [female] 's eyes . yet [female] went on trying to win [female] to like her once more ; it was one of her great labours . and learning to read from [female] 's mother was another , [female] tried to do all she could for [female] . [female] had told her to take care of his wife and child .
it was not unexpected entirely , aunt juley 's health had been bad all the winter . she had had a long series of colds and coughs . and had been too busy to get rid of them , she had scarcely promised her niece `` to really take my tiresome chest in hand , '' when she caught a chill and developed acute pneumonia . [female] and tibby went down to swanage , [female] was telegraphed for .
and all this torture for nothing , in the end ! what looked at last like a possible prize ( oh , without illusions , but still a prize ) . broken in her hands , fallen in the dust . the bitter dust , of disappointment , she revelled in the miserable revenge . pretty safe too -- only regretting the unworthiness of the girlish figure which stood for so much she had longed to be able to spit venom at .
scarcely had the lookout after a short passage descried the first land . and hailed the deck with `` land ho ! '' when a change was instantly observed among the crew , captain bramble . however , was on the watch , and so were his backers ; and seeing this . he instantly called one of the ringleaders aft , and bade him sternly to lay his hand to a rope and pull it taut .
[female] sat and gazed moodily into the wood fire . wallace respected his silence , it was yet too early for the fashionable world . so the two friends had the place to themselves . gradually the twilight fell ; strange shadows leaped and died on the wall . a boy dressed all in white turned on the lights , by and by the waiter announced that their repast awaited them .
all three laughed as meg spoke , for that linen closet was a joke . you see , having said that if meg married `` that [female] '' she should not have a cent of her money . aunt march was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow . she never broke her word .
the train moved on , and the porter stood looking after it with tears in his eyes . over the first half crown he had said to himself . `` milk and new laid eggs , '' now , as he pocketed the second . he added the other two things mentioned by the parish doctor . `` soup and jelly '' ; and his heart glowed , `` your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of these things . ''
but we are defending right , the natural law , the sovereignty of each one over himself from which no abdication is possible . justice and truth , and in case of need . we die like the three hundred spartans , we do not think of [male] but of leonidas . and we march straight before us , and once pledged , we do not draw back . and we rush onwards with head held low , cherishing as our hope an unprecedented victory .
there was some talk of returning to arden at the end of a month . they were now at the close of january . by the first of march mr. [male] hoped to be at the court . his architect and his head bailiff were alike eager for his return . there were more pullings down and reconstructions required on the new estate .
she had got her hat and shawl . and was off before he had finished his last words , the long high street was almost empty of people at that early hour . one side was entirely covered by the cool morning shadow which lay on the pavement . and crept up the opposite houses till only the topmost story caught the [female] sunlight . up the hill road , through the gap in the stone wall .
this brings you me so far as it can . such little words off so great a body of -- liking shall i call it ? my paper stops me : it is my last sheet . i should have to go down to the library to get more -- else i think i could not cease writing . how gladly i lay down that part of myself , and say -- but for you .
she was pleased to see him ; she , the wife of [female] . felt her heart beating faster , felt a sense of joy strangely mingled with fear . in all the occupations of her life , even amidst the all absorbing delight of her child 's society . she had not been able quite to forget this man , the one voice that had touched her heart . the one face that had haunted her girlish dream , came back to her again and again in spite of herself .
sola 's duties were now doubled , as she was compelled to care for the young martian as well as for me . but neither one of [female] required much attention , and as we were both about equally advanced in martian education . sola took it upon herself to train [female] together . her prize consisted in a male about four feet tall . very strong and physically perfect ; also , he learned quickly , and we had considerable amusement .
lovel pointed to the door of the chancel . which , highly ornamented , occupied the west end of the building , surmounted by the carved window . which let in a flood of moonlight over it . and in very truth , while the mendicant spoke , two human figures darkened with their shadows the entrance of the chancel . which had before opened to the moon lit meadow beyond , and the small lantern which one of them displayed .
`` she told you so -- did she ? '' returned [female] , with a more thoroughly distilled sneer , [female] was mute . the daring anger within her was turned into the rage of dumbness . what reasons for her belief could she give ? all the reasons that seemed so strong and living within her -- she saw them suffocated and shrivelled up under her husband 's breath .
he advanced with anxiety , but with calmness . seeing nothing , knowing nothing , buried in chance . that is to say , engulfed in [location] , by degrees , we will admit . a certain horror seized upon him , the gloom which enveloped him penetrated his spirit . he walked in an enigma , this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable .
next day i returned to the forest of evil report . which had now a new and even greater charm -- the [male] of the unknown and the mysterious . still , the warning i had received made me distrustful and cautious at first . for i could not help thinking about it , when we consider how much of their life is passed in the woods . which become as familiar to them as the streets of our native town to us .
until night they ate , when any of them were too tired of sitting . they went out for a stroll in the yard . or for a game with corks in the granary . and then returned to table , some towards the finish went to sleep and snored . but with the coffee everyone woke up , then they began songs .
within half an hour of sunrise we had reached the top of the rise of which i have spoken . and a most beautiful view broke upon our gaze , beneath [male] was a rich stretch of country . verdant with grass and lovely with foliage and flowers . in the background , at a distance , so far as i could judge . of some eighteen miles from where we then stood , a huge and extraordinary mountain rose abruptly from the plain .
quivering still with a rage that entirely obliterated his alarm at what he had learnt . [male] rolled into the presence of his [female] with that evil message . she listened to him in a dumb white fury . then she fell to reviling her lord and the slave girl in a breath . and called upon [female] to break their bones and blacken their faces and rot their flesh with all the fervour of one born and bred in the true faith .
at yonville he was considered `` well bred , '' he listened to the arguments of the older people . and did not seem hot about politics -- a remarkable thing for a young man . then he had some accomplishments ; he painted in water colours . could read the key of g , and readily talked literature after dinner when he did not play cards . [male] respected him for his education .
at length she began to grow perceptibly paler and feebler week by week . day by day , until she could no longer go out into the wood . but sat or reclined , panting for breath in the dull hot room , waiting for death to release her . at the same time little rima , who had always appeared frail . as if from sympathy , now began to fade and look more shadowy , so that it was expected she would not long survive her parent .
but [male] could receive no amends ; his suffering could not be cancelled . his respect and affection could not be recovered by any prompt deeds of atonement . he stood like an immovable obstacle against which no pressure could avail . an embodiment of what [male] most shrank from believing in . the irrevocableness of his own wrongdoing , the words of scorn .
through the quiet evening air , sweet and clear as a silver bell . came the long , musical note of the call that brings the cows home for the milking . it was [female] 's voice . [female] -- boss , [female] -- boss . [female] -- boss , far across the brule they could see her standing on a big pine stump near the bars .
the town , the louvre and the hotel [male] ville . the university , the sorbonne , the town had the markets . the city , the hospital ; the university , the pre aux clercs . offences committed by the scholars on the left bank were tried in the law courts on the island . and were punished on the right bank at montfauçon ; unless the rector .
in this posture of affairs , the letter of invitation arrives from lady luneham at bath . it was shewn to dorriforth ; and to prove to his ward that he is so much offended . as no longer to feel that excessive interest in her concerns which he once felt . he gives an opinion on the subject with indifference . he desires `` miss milner will do what she herself thinks proper . ''
being asked by her to repeat what he had said , he did so two or three times . and then it came out that he must have seen more than they supposed when he looked up to see the horse . for the murmur was , `` who is the boofer lady ? '' now , the boofer , or beautiful , lady was [female] . and whereas this notice from the poor baby would have touched her of itself .
dantes took the lamp , placed it on a projecting stone above the bed . whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic [male] on the distorted countenance and motionless , stiffened body . with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative . the draught produced a galvanic effect , a violent trembling pervaded the old man 's limbs . his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them .
she fell back in her chair staring at him . her mouth opened and a mumble came from it , then there was silence a moment . and then she began to shake , and one hand beat upon the table with its rings . so they waited a while , watching the tremulous , shapeless mass of her . and the tap , tap , tap of her hand beat through the room .
and when they filled their glasses and lifted them and shouted admiring jests to her . she broke into one of her stable boy songs , and sang it in the voice of a skylark . no man among them was used to showing her the courtesies of polite breeding . she had been too long a boy to them for that to have entered any mind . and when she finished her song .
the boat train slid into the station , bells rang . engines blew off steam , porters shouted . baggage trucks rattled over the platform , the train began to give up its contents . now in ones and twos , now in a steady stream . most of the travellers seemed limp and exhausted , and were pale with the pallor that comes of a choppy channel crossing .
my mind flew back to the [female] women . with a sort of [female] , what had [female] meant by that wild outburst of hers ? then , suddenly , it burst upon me what a hideous thing it was that she had done by keeping silent . it was the letter , arriving at that last desperate moment . which had snatched [female] and [female] from the horrible pit which yawned before them .
they found [female] , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature . and had some extracts to admire , and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to . [female] and [male] had information for them of a different sort . much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday . several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged .
after breakfast the next morning , an obstacle , which the events of the evening before had put out of my memory . interposed to prevent our proceeding immediately to the farm , this was my last day at [organization] . and it was necessary , as soon as the post came in , to follow miss [female] 's advice . and to ask mr. [male] 's permission to shorten my engagement by a month . in consideration of an unforeseen necessity for my return to [location] .
in the beginning he had called on her several times along with the druggist . [male] had not appeared particularly anxious to see him again , and leon did not know what to do between his fear of being indiscreet and the desire for an intimacy that seemed almost impossible . when the first cold days set in emma left her bedroom for the sitting room . a long apartment with a low ceiling , in which there was on the mantelpiece a large bunch of coral spread out against the looking glass . seated in her arm chair near the window .
evidently there were new-comers into the house , the window was open by an inch . it had warped , and would not shut down , bitterly alessandro recollected how he had put off from day to day the planing of that window to make it shut tight . now , thanks to the crack , he could hear all that was said . the woman looked weary and worn , her face was a sensitive one , and her voice kindly . but the man had the countenance of a brute .
and before [female] had got to the chamber set apart for him as lord foxham 's guest . the troops in the holm were cheering around their fires . for upon that same day , not twenty miles away , a second crushing blow had been dealt to the power of lancaster . the next morning [male] was afoot before the sun . and having dressed himself to the best advantage with the aid of the lord foxham 's baggage .
the bailiff came in , and said everything , thank god . was doing well ; but informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched . this piece of news irritated levin . the new drying machine had been constructed and partly invented by levin . the bailiff had always been against the drying machine .
he had no servant now , no grandly developed luggage . no gun , no elaborate dress for the mountains . on that former occasion his heart had been very full when he reached loughlinter . and his heart was full now , then he had resolved to say a few words to lady [male] . and he had hardly known how best to say them , now he would be called upon to say a few to lady [male] 's husband .
she felt immensely well disposed towards [male] . he , at least , would grab no more , his grabbing days . so sudden and so brief , were done , nice man ; agreeable man , she now definitely liked him . clearly he had been getting into some sort of a tangle . and she was grateful to lotty for stopping her in time at dinner from saying something hopelessly complicating .
job 's remarks were not of an exactly cheering order to a man who had passed such a night as i had . and , what is more , they had the weight of truth . taking one thing with another , it appeared to me to be an utter impossibility that we should escape from the place we were . supposing that leo recovered , and supposing that she would let [female] go . which was exceedingly doubtful , and that she did not `` blast '' [female] in some moment of vexation .
as they stood on the verge of the defile . by the bridge that swung out from the cliff like a fairy structure . they heard far and faint the whistle and low rumble of the night train south bound from [location] . and to both of them the sound urged the very real and practical world from which for a little time they had stolen away . `` i must go back , '' said [female] , and turned to the bridge and put her hand on its slight iron frame .
catherine continued to live in her father 's house in spite of its being represented to her that a maiden lady of quiet habits might find a more convenient abode in one of the smaller dwellings . with brown stone fronts , which had at this time begun to adorn the transverse thoroughfares in the upper part of the town . she liked the earlier structure -- it had begun by this time to be called an `` old '' house . and proposed to herself to end her days in it , if it was too large for a pair of unpretending gentlewomen . this was better than the opposite fault ; for [female] had no desire to find herself in closer quarters with her aunt .
this all took place in the closing week of the session . filling our poor prime minister with trouble and dismay . just when other people were complaining that there was nothing to think of and nothing to do . men do not really like leaving [location] before the grouse calls them . the grouse , or rather the fashion of the grouse .
on his own side the loss had been cruel , the jaws of the little street and the ruins of the barricade were heaped with the dead and dying . and out of the hundred men with whom he had begun the battle . there were not seventy left who could still stand to arms , at the same time . the day was passing , the first reinforcements might be looked for to arrive at any moment . and the lancastrians , already shaken by the result of their desperate but unsuccessful onslaught .
love is a game at which a woman must play against stacked cards . and without the slightest inkling of the trump , to a woman marriage is the beginning of life . to a man it is the end of `` liberty and the pursuit of happiness . '' perfect wife : that which a married man always fancies he might have gotten if he had kept on experimenting a little longer . why is it that , no matter how much a man thinks of one girl .
fanny was almost stunned , the smallness of the house and thinness of the walls brought everything so close to her . that , added to the fatigue of her journey , and all her recent agitation . she hardly knew how to bear it , within the room all was tranquil enough . for [female] having disappeared with the others , there were soon only her father and herself remaining . and he , taking out a newspaper , the accustomary loan of a neighbour .
when [female] returned with the album , he was already gone . and stepan arkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived . `` and nothing would induce him to come up , what a queer fellow he is ! '' added stepan arkadyevitch , all of them looked at each other . saying nothing , and began to look at [male] 's album .
parry did not think it his duty to resist any longer . he knew [male] of old ; he knew that . although a gascon , his words never promised more than they could stand to . he crossed a court and a little garden . appeased the dog , that seemed most anxious to taste of the musketeer 's flesh .
the trees were bare of leaves . and the river was bare of water lilies . but the sky was not bare of its beautiful blue , and the water reflected it . and a delicious wind ran with the stream , touching the surface crisply . perhaps the old mirror was never yet made by human hands , which , if all the images it has in its time reflected could pass across its surface again .
alta came after him , quickly , with pacific intent . she was a tall girl , not very well filled out , like an immature bean pod . her heavy [female] hair was cut in a waterfall of bangs which came down to her eyebrows . the rest of it done up behind in loops like sausages . and fastened with a large , red ribbon , she had put off her apron .
she could no longer sit still , and going into her bedroom she peeped through the door into knight 's room beyond . it was dark , as she expected to find it . for she had been almost sure that she would have heard him if he had entered the vestibule . returning to her own rooms , she pulled back the sea blue curtains which covered the large window looking on to the loggia . the sky was silver white with moonlight between the [female] stems of the tall pines .
but the musician did his best ; adopted his wife 's name . made england permanently his home , took great trouble with his child 's education . the expenses of which were defrayed by the grandfather , and throve as the chief local musician till her mother 's death . when he left off thriving , drank , and died also . the girl was left to the care of her grandfather .
clover exclaimed with delight at the view . the ranges which lapped and held the high , sheltered upland in embrace opened toward the south . and revealed a splendid lonely peak , on whose summit a drift of freshly fallen snow was lying . the contrast with the verdure and bloom below was charming . the cabin -- it was little more -- stood facing this view .
mr elliot was rational , discreet , polished . but he was not open , there was never any burst of feeling . any warmth of indignation or delight . at the evil or good of others . this , to [female] , was a decided imperfection , her early impressions were incurable .
nelly herself never seemed to be conscious of the social gulf between them . at least she never alluded to it in any way . and accepted winslow 's attentions as if she had a perfect right to them . she had broken the record by staying with mrs. pennington four weeks . and even the cats were in subjection , winslow was well enough to have gone back to the city and .
while making these maternal inquiries mrs. march got her wet things off . her warm slippers on , and sitting down in the easy chair , drew [female] to her lap . preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day , the girls flew about . trying to make things comfortable , each in her own way , meg arranged the tea table . jo brought wood and set chairs .
after which he mewed like a cat , and relapsed into silent meditation once more . he closed his eyes and pondered on his favourite problem . why was he a parrot ? this was always good for an hour or so . and it was three o'clock before he had come to his customary decision that he did not know . then , exhausted by brain work and feeling a trifle hipped by the silence of the room .
the strike had thrown him terribly behindhand . as to the completion of these orders , even with his own accustomed and skilled workpeople . he would have had some difficulty in fulfilling his engagements . as it was , the incompetence of the irish hands . who had to be trained to their work , at a time requiring unusual activity .
edna had attempted all summer to learn to swim , she had received instructions from both the men and women . in some instances from the children , [male] had pursued a system of lessons almost daily . and he was nearly at the point of discouragement in realizing the futility of his efforts . a certain ungovernable dread hung about her when in the water . unless there was a hand near by that might reach out and reassure her , but that night she was like the little tottering .
when [female] left adare he went to his room . put on heavier moccasins , and went quietly from the house . three inches of fresh snow had fallen , and the air was thick with the white deluge . he hurried into the edge of the forest . a few minutes futile searching convinced him of the impossibility of following the trail made by [organization] and the man he had pursued .
he did not even realize at the moment that it was connected with this bewilderment . he only knew that the foundation upon which he had been building for years seemed suddenly to have been torn from under him by invisible hands . and left his feet sinking slowly down on nothing ; and his inmost soul took suddenly up that solemn question with which he had never before troubled his logical brain . `` i can not help asking myself why i was made ? '' there was only one other readable word on that paper , turn it whichever way he would .
[female] , as she had always been called , was clever . rich , and pretty , and knew well how to ingratiate herself with the friend of the hour . she was a greedy , grasping little woman . but , when she had before her a sufficient object . she could appear to pour all that she had into her friend 's lap with all the prodigality of a child .
there was but one resource , he would go and tell irwine . tell him everything , the mere act of telling it would make it seem trivial . the temptation would vanish , as the charm of fond words vanishes when one repeats them to the indifferent . in every way it would help him to tell irwine . he would ride to [organization] rectory the first thing after breakfast tomorrow .
why could not he be self confident and ready ? and , leaning his chin on his hands . he imagined the ride he might have had with her . a week-end was but a week-end , and he had missed three hours of it . did he know any one except himself who would have been such a flat ? he did not . he dressed for dinner early , and was first down , he would miss no more .
[male] lost sight of it . it seemed probable that it would do some injury to the sloop . fortunately , the water in the interior of the rocks . shut in on all sides , felt little of the commotion without . the waves there were comparatively trifling , and the shock was not likely to be very severe .
but today she had spoken her mind with all the energy which comes of suppression . she had relieved herself with a flow of words of all the pent up hostility that had been growing within her since that first meeting in this same room . she had talked rapidly , for she was talking against time . [organization] of the principal city in [female] 's constituency in the north of england had decided that tomorrow morning should witness the laying of the foundation stone of their new town hall . and [male] as the sitting member was to preside at the celebration .
but you are going to be put in a safe place , you know . or that rascal will get hold of ye , and carry ye off and ruin me . he then with some difficulty lowered the box into the hole . raked in the earth upon it , and lowered the flagstone . which he was a long time in fixing to his satisfaction .
now he rushed to the bed on which she lay . and half knelt , half threw himself upon it . imploring her to forgive him ; regardless for the time of any evil consequences to her . it seemed as if he must have her pardon . her relenting -- at any price , even if they both died in the act of reconciliation .
`` i do not know , '' said the old man , still shaking his head . no , thank ye , i never eats butter in town . i have kept store myself , and he was no little pleased with the laugh that went around the table . the fact was he was generally pleased with june 's environment and .
he threw on another log , then lifted her a little and brought her a glass of cool water . and climbed back to his cabin , walking lightly and swiftly , thus far he had felt no more need of his books than he had for his surgical instruments . but now he was glad he had them for the sake of the girl who was `` that sot on all such . '' he would open the box the moment he had eaten . and look them over , the little brother should take them down to her one at a time .
with the dull stab of a thing that of late had been growing inside him . he wondered what had happened to carmin fanchet in the years that had gone since he had brought about the hanging of her brother . last night and the night before , strange dreams of her had come to him in restless slumber . it was disturbing to him that he should wake up in the middle of the night dreaming of her . when he had gone to his bed with a mind filled to overflowing with the sweet presence of [male] boulain .
again , the late alliance of her family with the tollers had brought her in connection with the best circle . which gratified her in every direction except in the inclination to those serious views which she believed to be the best in another sense . the sharp little woman 's conscience was somewhat troubled in the adjustment of these opposing `` bests , '' and of her griefs and satisfactions under late events . which were likely to humble those who needed humbling , but also to fall heavily on her old friend whose faults she would have preferred seeing on a background of prosperity .
a candle , too , on the pulpit steps , there was the tip tap tip of a tack hammer going on in a distant corner . was somebody hanging christmas garlands ? the new red carpet attracted his notice , and as he grew accustomed to the dim light . it carried his eye along the aisle he had trod so many years of sundays . to the old familiar pew , the sound of the hammer ceased and a woman rose from her knees .
standing before her with his hands behind him and his legs a little apart . he swayed slightly to and fro , inclined toward her as if rising on his toes . it had an effect of conscientious deliberation , no . i have not , i could not , i would not , it was so respectable . a show that she felt afresh , and with the memory of their old despair .
{ 187 } it is to be observed , that every allusion to any thing or personage in the old testament . such as the ark , or [female] , is equally the privilege of mussulman and jew . indeed , the former profess to be much better acquainted with the lives , true and fabulous . of the patriarchs , than is warranted by our own sacred writ ; and not content with [female] . they have a biography of pre adamites .
not to speak of our kind love for them . and i do assure you , i loved some horses . and even some cows for that matter , as if they had been my blood relations . knowing as i did their virtues , and some of these were lost to us . and i could not bear to think of them , therefore i worked hard all night to try and save the rest of them .
but i , as her chronicler , deny that she was pug nosed . and all the world who knew her soon came to understand that she was no puppet . in figure she was small , but not so small as she looked to be . her feet and hands were delicately fine , and there was a softness about her whole person . an apparent compressibility , which seemed to indicate that she might go into very small compass .
the considerations thus presented to me in the diary . joined to certain surmises of my own that grew out of them , suggested a conclusion which i wondered i had not arrived at before . i now said to myself -- what [male] had once said to [male] at blackwater park . what madame [male] had overheard by listening at the door . the count is a spy , [male] had applied the word to him at hazard .
the dairy work lasted only till the milk began to lessen , for she had not met with a second regular engagement as at talbothays . but had done duty as a supernumerary only , however , as harvest was now beginning . she had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble to find plenty of further occupation . and this continued till harvest was done , of the five and twenty pounds which had remained to her of clare 's allowance . after deducting the other half of the fifty as a contribution to her parents for the trouble and expense to which she had put them .
thus the doctor walked about his room , much [male] . now accusing himself for having been so angry with lady [male] , and then feeding his own anger by thinking of her misconduct . the only immediate conclusion at which he resolved was this , that it was unnecessary that he should say anything to [female] on the subject of her ladyship 's visit . there was , no doubt , sorrow enough in store for his [male] . why should he aggravate it ? lady [female] would doubtless not stop now in her course .
in the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more than a miner 's candlestick . convicts were , at that period , sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which [organization] toulon . and it was not rare for them to have miners tools at their command , these miners candlesticks are of massive iron , terminated at the lower extremity by a point .
lately , however , it had seemed to her that they were making no way at all . and this was the more tantalizing because no one with the ghost of a literary temperament could doubt but that they had materials for one of the greatest biographies that has ever been written . shelves and boxes bulged with the precious stuff . the most private lives of the most interesting people lay furled in yellow bundles of close written manuscript . in addition to this mrs. [female] had in her own head as bright a vision of that time as now remained to the living .
if [female] had been a poet , it was a beautiful spectacle . the immense strand of a league or more , the sea covers at high tide . and which , at the reflux , appears gray and desolate , strewed with polypi and seaweed . with pebbles sparse and white , like bones in some vast old cemetery . but the soldier , the politician , and the ambitious man .
when they reached the bank there stood thomasin . in a stress of grief , bending over the two unconscious ones who already lay there . the horse and cart were brought to the nearest point in the road . and it was the work of a few minutes only to place the three in the vehicle . venn led on the horse , supporting thomasin upon his arm .
the sun had sunk so far , when they set out at last , as to throw the whole of the square into golden shade . and , in the narrow , overhung friar 's gate . where the windows of the upper stories were so near that a man might shake hands with his friend on the other side . the twilight had already begun , they had determined to walk , in order less to attract attention . in spite of the filth through which they knew they must pass .
he could order a dinner at sherry 's as readily as drinks at sharkey 's . most valuable accomplishment of all , he learned to laugh , in the way of by products he picked up a working acquaintance with american . english and german [male] -- french [male] he already knew as a mother tongue . considerable geographical knowledge of the capitals of [location] . [male] and [location] , a taste that discriminated between tobacco and the stuff sold as such in [location] .
`` oh , quite , '' said teddy , convulsively , and lifted an imaginary hat and left her . mr. [male] had shown on previous occasions that he found ann veronica interesting and that he wished to interest her . he was a civil servant of some standing . and after a previous conversation upon aesthetics of a sententious , nebulous , and sympathetic character . he had sent her a small volume .
agatha , not a word. -- but in time of war . you know , letters miscarry , [male] . no . since the death of his mother this castle has only been inhabited by servants . for he settled as far off as alsace , upon the estate of his wife , [male] . but tell me my father 's name .
she had accomplished a hideous act of renunciation and returned to the one . [female] 's own faith held firm . she knew the human soul will be merged , if it be merged at all . with the stars and the sea , yet she felt that her sister had been going amiss for many years . it was symbolic the catastrophe should come now , on a [location] afternoon .
but now silence , she could see that many a roof had fallen . and that ruins of outhouses filled the yard . she remembered the kitchen windows , bright in the setting sun . and the white capped servants moving about the great white table , but now the shutters were up . nowhere a light ; the knocker had disappeared from the door .
many historians say that the french did not win the battle of borodino because [male] had a cold . and that if he had not had a cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius and [location] would have been lost and the face of the world have been changed . to historians who believe that [location] was shaped by the will of one man . [male] the great -- and that [location] from a republic became an empire and french armies went to [location] at the will of one man . [male] -- to say that [location] remained a power because [male] had a bad cold on the twenty fourth of august may seem logical and convincing .
he had been leaning , or half sitting . on the bed , and she had placed herself beside him . how was it that she had again taken him by the coat . and again looked up into his face with those soft , trusting eyes ? was it a trick with her ? had she ever taken that other man by the coat in the same way .
with his fortunatus 's goblet ready in his hand . mr [male] sat down on one side of the table before the fire . and the strange man on the other : [male] occupying a stool between the latter and the fireside . the background , composed of handkerchiefs , coats , shirts . hats , and other old articles `` on leaving , ''
the sentiments of the hearers were various , some were of opinion that the folly of his choice had been justly punished by condemnation to perpetual perseverance . one of the youngest among them , with great vehemence , pronounced him a hypocrite . some talked of the right of society to the labour of individuals . and considered retirement as a desertion of duty . others readily allowed that there was a time when the claims of the public were satisfied .
christine returned on the following day , she returned in triumph . she renewed her extraordinary success of the gala performance . since the adventure of the `` toad , '' carlotta had not been able to appear on the stage . the terror of a fresh `` co ack '' filled her heart and deprived her of all her power of singing . and the theater that had witnessed her incomprehensible disgrace had become odious to her , she contrived to cancel her contract .
but the little king wished geraint to come to his castle to be rested and healed of his wounds . and geraint and [male] went and abode there a few days . but ever sir geraint was cold and stern to his wife , for he was still angry at her disbelief in him . while the sun climbed up the sky they rode through the wilderness . by tangled woods , deep valleys and quaking marshes .
the moment , therefore , that she next saw him . she acquainted him with the speeches of sir [male] and the behaviour of mr. [male] . there needed no rhetoric to point out to mr. [male] the danger of suffering such expectations . or the impropriety of her present situation : he was struck with both in a manner the most forcible . and spared not for warmth of expression to alarm her delicacy .
the squire kissed her forehead affectionately and took his leave . feeling , somehow , that he had been excused and pitied , and made much of . whereas he had called on his young neighbour with the intention of excusing . and pitying , and making much of her , he was not quite comfortable as he left the house . but , nevertheless , he was sufficiently honest hearted to own to himself that [male] thorne was a fine girl .
he had just received a box of new books from his [location] book seller . and had preferred the prospect of a quiet sunday at home with his spoils . but he now went into the club writing room . wrote a hurried telegram , and told the servant to send it immediately . he knew that mrs. reggie did not object to her visitors
now , seeing how i heeded her , and feeling that i had kissed her . although she was such a little girl , eight years old or thereabouts . she turned to the stream in a bashful manner . and began to watch the water , and rubbed one leg against the other , i , for my part . being vexed at her behaviour to me , took up all my things to go .
the scales fell from [female] 's eyes . how had she stood [female] for a moment ? he was absolutely intolerable , and the same evening she broke off her engagement . he was bewildered , he had nothing to say . he was not even angry , but stood , with a glass of whiskey between his hands .
but [female] felt it more than any one , the horse ought to have won . [female] had been favoured by such a series of accidents that the whole affair had been a miracle . [male] had these circumstances at his fingers ends , and in the course of the afternoon and evening explained them accurately to all who would listen to him . he had this to say on his own behalf , -- that before the party had left the course their horse stood first favourite for the leger .
the proprietor of the house was a belgian merchant . called [female] -- a sedate old bachelor , who took a great deal of snuff . and disquieted himself very little about the world in general , so long as life went smoothly for himself . the remaining occupant of the house was a medical student . who rented one of the rooms on the third floor , another room on the same floor was to let .
love at eight and forty is a very [female] and indolent emotion . marking the most delightful stage in the progress of the great human passion . at twenty five we talk it ; at thirty five we act it . at forty five it is [male] to sit down and think about it . the very young man loves without really analyzing , ten years later he analyzes without really loving .
four years of the philanthropic slaughterhouse had not convinced him . he was one of those who will never accept the flat contradiction of facts . he had a twofold pride , the secret pride of his race . which race he wished to rehabilitate , and his pride personal that wanted to prove itself right . he wished this all the more because he was not entirely sure of it .
nevertheless he wrote a letter strongly advising [male] to abandon the project . but he himself was aware that the letter which he wrote was not one from which any success could be expected . he advised his son , but did not command him . he made no threats as to stopping his income . he did not tell [male] , in so many words .
in the drawing room they were met with equal cordiality by the mother . and miss bertram had all the distinction with each that she could wish . after the business of arriving was over , it was first necessary to eat . and the doors were thrown open to admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into the appointed dining parlour . where a collation was prepared with abundance and elegance .
she wore a grey silken gown . i glanced at [male] , but he did not see me . his eyes were fixed on the door , which had disclosed and concealed the momentary picture . its momentariness impressed it the more vividly on my memory . i have it there still , a girl , in early but not precocious maturity .
so fierce had been the stroke that the sword stuck fast in the bone and the helmet . and sir [male] pulled thrice at his sword before it would loosen . sir [male] to his knees with a deathly groan . then he threw away his sword and shield . and rising , staggered away towards his ship , sir [male] swooned and fell ; and his squire came running to him .
so the days passed , without much variety , for the suttons were not addicted to excursions . [female] was profoundly happy ; she had forgotten care . she agreed to every suggestion for amusement . each moment had its pleasure , and this pleasure was quite independent of the thing done . it sprang from all activities and idlenesses .
the next morning king [male] was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him . all [location] was crowding to the doors of the house . the throng was terrific , and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination . when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied . but being anxious not to be too conspicuous , all , with the exception of [male] .
[male] had not been challenged in any way ; the gatekeepers had looked at him . indeed , as he came out of the city ; but so they always did . and the landlady here had run her eyes over him . but that was the way of landladies who wished to know how much should be charged to travellers . and if he had come out so easily , why should not his friends ? all turned now .
the group closed in on them and for the first time in his life [male] realized the insuperable inconvenience of being passionately detested . he gazed around helplessly at the glowering , violently hostile faces , he towered a head taller than his roommate . so if he hit back he would be called a bully and have half a dozen more fights on his hands within five minutes . yet if he did not he was a coward . for a moment he stood there facing gilly 's blazing eyes .
the last word , as it came from his lips . meant that nothing would stop them , he almost shouted it . and [male] answered , in spite of their effort . darkness closed in on them , with the first dusk of this night there came sudden lulls in which the blizzard seemed to have exhausted itself . jolly [male] read the signs , by tomorrow there would be no storm and breault the ferret would be on the trail again .
four days later [female] received the following letter . written on extremely fine paper , protected by two envelopes , and sealed with the arms of canalis . mademoiselle , -- the admiration for fine works implies something so lofty and sincere as to protect you from all light jesting . and to justify before the sternest judge the step you have taken in writing to me . but let [female] look still further , how could the dreamy , solitary life you lead .
everybody seems to be going through life at automobile speed nowadays . but alas , there are no sentimental garages by life 's wayside at which we may obtain a fresh supply of emotions . purchase a new thrill or patch up an exploded ideal , a man 's work lasts from sun to sun . but his excuses for staying late at the office are never done , every man wants a woman to appeal to his better side . his nobler instincts and his higher nature .
she had fancied that life would be so bright for her when the day of her freedom came . that she would reap so rich a harvest of happiness as a reward for the sacrifice which she had made in marrying old [male] . and enduring his peevishness and ill health with tolerable good humour during the half dozen years of their wedded life . she had fancied this ; and now her release had come to her , and was worthless in her sight . because the one man she cared for had proved himself cold and indifferent .
selfishly dear as she had long been to lady bertram . she could not be parted with willingly by her , no happiness of son or niece could make her wish the marriage . but it was possible to part with her . because [female] remained to supply her place , [male] became the stationary niece . delighted to be so ; and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of mind .
the cook , with her thigh broken by a shell splinter . had been carried into the kitchen , alpatych , his coachman . ferapontov 's wife and children and the house porter were all sitting in the cellar , listening . the roar of guns , the whistling of projectiles . and the piteous moaning of the cook , which rose above the other sounds .
they lingered for some time over the fruit and coffee . and when they rose to go darrow suggested that , if she felt disposed for the play . they were not too late for the second part of the programme at one of the smaller theatres . darrow had called for a theatrical journal , and he presently looked up from it to say . `` i hear the second play at the athenee is amusing . ''
on his arrival in [location] [male] lopez found a letter waiting for him from the duchess . this came into his hand immediately on his reaching the rooms in belgrave mansions . and was of course the first object of his care . `` that contains my fate , '' he said to his wife . putting his hand down upon the letter , he had talked to her much of the chance that had come in his way .
prince [male] was in complete control at serros and was disposed to laugh at the demands of his late captors . his half-brother , the dethroned prince [location] . was still hiding in the fastnesses of the hills , protected by a small company of nobles . and there was no hope that he ever could regain his crown . [male] 's power over the army was supreme .
they reached a place where their ways divided . [female] continued along the highway which kept outside the copse . and [female] opened a gate that entered it . she walked up the soft grassy ride . screened on either hand by nut bushes , just now heavy with clusters of twos and threes and fours .
at these words of miriam , a tremor and horror appeared to seize upon her persecutor . insomuch that he shook and grew ashy pale before her eyes . in this man 's memory there was something that made it awful for him to think of prayer . nor would any torture be more intolerable than to be reminded of such divine comfort and succor as await pious souls merely for the asking . this torment was perhaps the token of a native temperament deeply susceptible of religious impressions .
the secrets of the world are very marvellous , but they are not themselves half so wonderful as the way in which they become known to the world . there could be no doubt that mr. [male] 's high ambition had foundered . and that he had been degraded through the secret enmity of the duchess of omnium . it was equally certain that his secret enmity to [male] finn had brought this punishment on his head . but before the ministry had been a week in office almost everybody knew that it was so .
because he had the eye to see his opportunity . the heart to prompt to well timed action , the nerve to consummate a perfect work . and no tyrant passion dragged him back ; no enthusiasms . no foibles encumbered his way , how well he looked at this very moment ! when [male] looked up as he reached her side .
she wore a plain dress of cheap . cream tinted cotton voile , with the usual girdle of crimson . [female] was never without her touch of crimson . she had told [female] that she never felt satisfied without a gleam of red somewhere about her . if it were only a flower , to [female] .
the cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript . his cheek upon his hand , and looked intently at the young man for a moment . no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal [male] . and [male] felt this glance run through his veins like a fever . he however kept a good countenance , holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his eminence .
he paused but for one single moment , then yielding to the power of his almost ungovernable temper . he drew his sword and rushed forward , determined to sacrifice his brother 's life . [female] seeing plainly and instantly the state of affairs . threw herself with a scream of terror before [male] to protect him . unarmed as he was , from the keen weapon that gleamed in his brother 's hand .
she found her seated upon a sofa . from which , however , she arose at her approach ; but the moment [female] beheld her . all the unfavourable impressions with which she came into her presence immediately vanished . and that respect which the formalities of her introduction had failed to inspire . her air , figure , and countenance instantaneously excited .
they stared at each other ; mrs. [female] surprised . inquiringly , mrs. wilkins with the eyes of some one who has had a revelation , of course . that was how it could be done , she herself . she by herself , could not afford it . and would not be able , even if she could afford it , to go there all alone .
i hastily threw some most necessary things into a bag , then i put a ten dollar bill of the housekeeping money into my purse . resolving to send it back to dicky as soon as i could get access to my own tiny bank account . the remnant of my teaching savings . into a parcel i placed the rest of the housekeeping money . my wedding and engagement rings and the lavalliere which dicky had given me as a wedding present .
such were the meditations of mr. [male] . and , on the final fall of the curtain , amid unrestrained enthusiasm on the part of the audience . he had despatched messengers in all directions with instructions to find mr. [male] and conduct him to the presence . meanwhile , he waited impatiently on the empty stage , the sudden advent of wally mason . who appeared at this moment , upset mr. [male] terribly .
there was a schoolroom not yet furnished with more than tables and chairs . its floors and walls bare . its windows having shades only , when worn out with the struggle the amazed boys had succumbed to sleep on little . hard , white beds with plain covers ; had awakened to a cold bath at the hands of a man . and when they rebelled and called for lucette and their accustomed clothing .
prudence opened the window , and we leaned side by side over the balcony . she watched the few passers , i reflected . all that she had said buzzed in my head , and i could not help feeling that she was right . but the genuine love which i had for marguerite had some difficulty in accommodating itself to such a belief . i sighed from time to time , at which prudence turned .
it is safest for the historian , if he values accuracy . to wait till a thing has happened before writing about it , otherwise he may commit himself to statements which are not borne out by the actual facts . mrs. peagrim , recording in advance the success of her party at the gotham theatre . had done this , it is true that she was a `` radiant and vivacious hostess , '' and it is possible , her standard not being very high , that she had `` never looked more charming . ''
with cheerful temper to match , and there above me was my unknown necessitous fellow creature . crying out in printers types : -- wanted , a companion for a lady . must be an accomplished musician , and have a cheerful temper , testimonials to capacity . and first rate references required , '' exactly what i had offered , `` apply by letter only . in the first instance , exactly what i had said , fie upon me .
[female] smiled joyously , the count , by his guests . went into the drawing room , it was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests . expecting the summons to [location] , avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk . in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food . the host and hostess look toward the door .
lord elmwood at this time . and for many months before , had been detained abroad by a severe and dangerous illness . which a too cautious fear of her uneasiness , had prompted him to conceal . and she received his frequent apologies for not returning , with a suspicion and resentment they were calculated . but not intended , to inspire , to violent anger , succeeded a degree of indifference still more fatal .
for some little way farther he struggled forward through the forest . but what with the pain of his wounds , the darkness of the night . and the extreme uneasiness and confusion of his mind . he soon became equally unable to guide himself or to continue to push through the close undergrowth . and he was fain at length to sit down and lean his back against a tree .
had he been asked , suddenly , the name of the tall blonde girl who sang among the sopranos . he could not have told it , she changed her position . and glanced quickly over the church , the livingstone pew was fully occupied . and well up toward the front , wallie sayre was steadfastly regarding her . she looked away quickly , came the end of the service .
when at last she returned to the unconscious marianne , she found her just awaking . refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes . [female] 's heart was full , the past , the present , the future . willoughby 's visit , marianne 's safety . and her mother 's expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue .
the country carts had more iron . and less wood and leather about the horse gear ; the people in the streets . although on pleasure bent , had yet a busy mind . the colours looked grayer -- more enduring , not so gay and pretty , there were no smock frocks . even among the country folk ; they retarded motion .
it was as if another yellow bird had come to puzzle [female] . the same slim , graceful little body , the same shining eyes . and yet she was half a dozen years younger than nada . for the first time [female] was looking at sun cloud . the daughter of yellow bird , and in that moment he loved her .
when the two musketeers had entered ; when the door was closed behind them . when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber , to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food , had recommenced . when [male] had three or four times paced in silence . and with a frowning brow , the whole length of his cabinet . passing each time before [male] and [male] .
but those of the other sex were the most interesting of this company of binders . by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature . and is not merely an object set down therein as at ordinary times . a field man is a personality afield ; a field woman is a portion of the field . she had somehow lost her own margin .
they were very gay in the old brick house that night before the departure . very noisy over the fish and [male] 's broiled lamb chop . [male] demanded a bottle of [male] 's home-made wine . and even [male] got a little of it , they toasted the seashore . and the departed nurse , and [male] quoted [male] at some length and in a horrible scotch accent .
she was near the gate leading into arden park . when she heard a crackling of withered leaves . the sound of an approaching footstep , it was mr. [male] , of course . she gave a sigh of resignation . another evening of the pattern which had grown so familiar to her , that it seemed almost as if mr. [female] must have been dropping in of an evening all her life .
the idea was taken up by prisoner after prisoner until the whole place was alive with barkings . yappings , roarings , pelican chatterings . and feline yowlings , interspersed with shrieks of hysterical laughter . to many in that crowded solitude it came as an extraordinary relief . it was better even than the hymn singing , but it annoyed [female] .
no one was there , [female] threw the window up and looked out . the wind rushed into the room , together with the sound of distant wheels . footsteps hurrying along the pavement , and the cries of sirens hooting down the river , [female] ! said katharine , but she spoke scarcely louder than she might have spoken to some one in the same room . with their eyes fixed upon the opposite side of the road .
at ten o'clock the ladies came down to breakfast , and the whole party were assembled , `` mr , [male] ! '' said lady [male] to that gentleman , who was the last to enter the room . `` this is a marvel , '' he was dressed in a dark blue frock coat . with a coloured silk handkerchief round his neck . and had brushed his hair down close to his head , he looked quite unlike himself .
it was nearly bedtime , but she rushed downstairs and asked if she might send for the parson . the moment happened to be one at which her father 's sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest . and his sensitiveness to the smudge which tess had set upon that nobility most pronounced . for he had just returned from his weekly booze at rolliver 's inn . no parson should come inside his door , he declared .
and he folded her in his arms . she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses . only she did not respond to them , her lips were cold . it appeared to [male] that he had embraced a statue . he was not the less intoxicated with joy , electrified by love .
gerald was excited by the desperate cleaving of [male] to naomi . the essence of that female , subterranean recklessness and mockery penetrated his blood . he could not forget [male] 's lifted , offered , cleaving , reckless , yet withal mocking weight . and [male] , watching like a hermit crab from its hole . had seen the brilliant frustration and helplessness of ursula .
in the early morning i renewed my rambles . going first to the little frame school house , the old church with its tall spire . the saw mill , the deacon 's cider press . the swimming pool , and a dozen other places of boyish adventure and misadventure . your true sentimentalist invariably gives the preference to scenes over persons .
those words took her off her guard ; she lifted her eyes to meet his . eyes full of love and despair . and again he told himself success was only a question of time . his apprenticeship was not finished yet ; he must be content to serve a little longer . when she had tasted the bitterness of her new life .
this dialogue led them to another hollow pause . the duke 's heart beat violently within him . why had he not asked her to take the star and keep it as a gift ? too late now , why could he not throw himself at her feet ? here were two beings , lovers of each other , with none by .
my dear clavering : -- i have been sorry to notice your continued absence from the office . and both [female] and i have been very sorry that you have discontinued coming to us . but i should not have written to you on this matter . not wishing to interfere in your own concerns , had i not desired to see you specially with reference to my sister . as i have that to say to you concerning her which i can hardly write .
prince [male] was in command of a regiment . and the management of that regiment , the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving and giving orders , engrossed him . the burning of smolensk and its abandonment made an epoch in his life . a novel feeling of anger against the foe made him forget his own sorrow . he was entirely devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and officers .
[female] sat on a high stool , dressing her hair at the glass . and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers . of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic . i was making my bed , having received strict orders from bessie to get it arranged before she returned ( for bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under nurserymaid . to tidy the room , dust the chairs , and [female] ) .
the candour of this speech recovered mr monckton from his apprehensions . and , carefully observing her looks while he spoke , he gave her the following account . that he had hastened to belfield 's lodgings the moment he left the opera house . and , after repeated denials , absolutely forced himself into his room . where he was quite alone , and in much agitation : he conversed with him for more than an hour upon the subject of the quarrel .
there was nothing left for lorry but to make a clean breast of it . which he did shamefacedly , expecting the laughter and raillery of his light hearted friend as payment for his confidence . instead , however , anguish , who possessed a lively and romantic nature , was charmed by the story and proclaimed it to be the most delightful adventure that had ever happened outside of a story book . `` tell me all about her , '' he urged . his eyes sparkling with boyish enthusiasm , and [male] to give him a personal description of the mysterious beauty .
she sank into rischenheim 's arms . i ran forward and knelt by mr. [male] . he still held sapt 's hands . and by their help buoyed himself up , but when he saw me he let go of them and sank back against me . his head resting on my chest , he moved his lips .
spring came round , with the first warm weather . when the pear trees began to blossom , she suffered from dyspnoea . from the beginning of july she counted how many weeks there were to october . thinking that perhaps the marquis d'andervilliers would give another ball at vaubyessard . but all september passed without letters or visits , after the ennui of this disappointment her heart once more remained empty .
the kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one . and as she went away , mrs. [female] said , with a mixture of satisfaction and regret . `` she does not love [female] yet , but will soon learn to , '' jo 's face was a study next day . for the secret rather weighed upon her , and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important . meg observed it , but did not trouble herself to make inquiries .
[male] lost hold of himself at last . the blood surged in him , and he caught at her and kissed her fiercely . it was he who was embarrassed , as he stood away from her . eyeing her with a queer defiant shame . she smiled through a small matter of a blush .
he appeared as a handsome and gentlemanly personage of six or eight and twenty . and was quizzing her through an eye glass , seeing that [male] was noticing him . he let his glass drop with a click upon the rail which protected the hedge . and walked away in the opposite direction , [male] knew in a moment that this must be mr. [male] . when he was gone , [male] pushed through the hollies .
ten minutes more and dozens of persons were gossiping about the engagement between [female] and the beautiful kentuckian . scores of questions were poured in upon [female] relative to her future sister in law . but none of them could she answer . vexed at her own ignorance , she ran upstairs to her mother . whom she told to `` come down immediately and see what fools they had made of themselves . ''
attendance on the cretin deprived me often of the power and inclination to swallow a meal . and sent me faint to the fresh air . and the well or fountain in the court . but this duty never wrung my heart , or brimmed my eyes . or scalded my cheek with tears hot as molten metal .
the moaning in his throat gave way to the voicing of her name . he shouted , and listened , he swayed back along the tongue of rock to the boulder strewn edge of the chasm wall . a hundred yards farther on was the opening of the chute . he came out of this , his clothes torn from him . his body bleeding , unrecognizable , half a madman .
ramona was as helpless in her freedom on this mountain eyrie as if she had been chained hand and foot . and so the winter wore away , and the spring , what wheat grew in their fields in this upper air ! wild oats , too , in every nook and corner . the goats frisked and fattened , and their hair grew long and silky ; the sheep were already heavy again with wool . and it was not yet midsummer , the spring rains had been good .
she had given a little jerk to the leash . speaking sharply to the poodle in reproach for some lingering near a wonderful sidewalk smell . imperceptible to any one except himself , instantly the creature rose and walked beside her on his hind legs . he continued to parade in this manner , rapidly , but nevertheless as if casually . without any apparent inconvenience ; and mrs. silver , never having seen a dog do such a thing before .
he , above all , longed to have the cunning enemy . who had so long baffled him , helpless in his power . he wished to gloat over him , to enjoy his downfall . to inflict upon him what moral and mental torture a deadly hatred alone can devise . the brave eagle , captured , and with noble wings clipped .
we always liked [male] 's stories . not for any wit in them ; but because we laughed at the man . rather than the matter , the way he held his head was enough . with his chin fixed hard like a certainty , not a sign of a smile in his lips or nose . but a power of not laughing ; and his eyes not turning to anybody .
i really believe i have finished , daddy . nothing else occurs to me at the moment . i will try to write a longer letter next time , [male] . the lettuce has not done at all well this year , it was so dry early in the season . well , daddy , master [male] 's here . and such a nice time as we are having , at least i am , and i think he is .
then sir [male] and sir [male] sir kehydius upon a shield betwixt them both . and led him to a forester 's lodge . and there they gave him in charge to keep him well . and with him they abode three days . then the two knights took their horses and at the cross they departed .
in this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented by madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition . when the jury made their report , the king appointed the inventor a chevalier of the legion of honor . a fresh excitement in the little town , well , so it was the cross that he wanted ! father madeleine refused the cross , decidedly this man was an enigma . the good souls got out of their predicament by saying , `` after all , he is some sort of an adventurer . ''
is it not rather to be wondered that anybody should ever care to be great for greatness ', sake . for any other reason than pure conscientiousness . the simple fidelity of the servant who fears to lay his talents by in a napkin . knowing that indifference is near akin to dishonesty ? if [male] had lived in the time of [male] a'kempis . he would very likely have built himself a narrow hermitage amid some forest loneliness .
i had come to see you with the hope that you would let me bring you over to my conviction . my reasons for entertaining this hope had been of the best , but you disappointed it . i found you changed , and you were able to give me no reason for the change . you admitted that you were unreasonable , and it was the only concession you would make . but it was a very cheap one , because that 's not your character , no , you are not .
dolokhov , after anatole entered , had remained at the wicket gate and was struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it . with a last desperate effort dolokhov pushed the porter aside . and when anatole ran back seized him by the arm . pulled him through the wicket , and ran back with him to the troyka . marya dmitrievna , having found sonya weeping in the corridor .
the place was too modest to attract the attention of people of fashion . and so quiet as to have escaped the notice of those in search of pleasure and dissipation . edna had discovered it accidentally one day when the high board gate stood ajar . she caught sight of a little green table . blotched with the checkered sunlight that filtered through the quivering leaves overhead , within she had found the slumbering mulatresse .
nor was she mistaken in her fears ; for mrs. [female] and [female] both had an inkling of what was going on . and when the latter heard [female] say something to her father in a low tone . and then saw them leave the room together , she arose and stealthily followed them upstairs . going out on the balcony , she stole softly up to [female] 's window . and there , unobserved , listened to a conversation which confirmed her worst fears .
he never turned his face to mine , or answered , except in monosyllables . the questions i put , or such slight pleasantries as i ventured . he seemed a part of the mute melancholy landscape . an incarnation of its frozen woe , with all that was warm and sentient in him fast bound below the surface . but there was nothing unfriendly in his silence , i simply felt that he lived in a depth of moral isolation too remote for casual access .
the sort of living being which lay upon that plank on the morning of quasimodo . in the year of the lord , 1467 , appeared to excite to a high degree . the curiosity of the numerous group which had congregated about the wooden bed . the group was formed for the most part of the fair sex . hardly any one was there except old women , in the first row , and among those who were most bent over the bed .
the emperor chung tsu favored this city before all others . the yen tower soaring heavenward . the drum towers , the pearl pagoda . were the only fit surroundings of his magnificence ; and in the pavilion of tranquil learning were held those discussions which enlightened the world and spread the fame of the jade emperor far and wide . in all respects he adorned the dragon throne .
when a courtesan intends to abandon a particular lover , and take up with another one . or when she has reason to believe that her lover will shortly leave her . and return to his wives ; or that having squandered all his money . and became penniless , his guardian , or master , or father would come and take him away . or that her lover is about to lose his position , or lastly , that he is of a very fickle mind .
on this day young [male] lawle and his friend and the dog rushed up the hill before mrs. wortle . and there began to romp , as was their custom , [female] , who was one of the party . followed them , enjoining the children to keep away from the cliff . for a while they did so , but of course returned . once or twice they were recalled and scolded , always asserting that the fault was altogether with [male] .
grey was a man tranquil in temperament . very little prone to quarrelling , with perhaps an exaggerated idea of the evil results of a row . a man who would take infinite trouble to avoid any such scene as that which now seemed to be imminent . but he was a man whose courage was quite as high as that of his opponent . to bully or be bullied were alike contrary to his nature , it was clear enough now that vavasor intended to bully him .
her first experience , as a child , was being shut up in a darkened room . and looking into a mirror , where figures and scenes appeared . like waking dreams , she had been frightened , and screamed to be let out . her mother had taken pity and released her . saying that after all it was what might be expected from the seventh child of a seventh child .
through those same months of winter , the great captains of trade in the city of edmonton had been preparing for the coming of the river brigades . the hundred and fifty miles of trail between that last city outpost of civilization and athabasca landing . the door that opened into the north , were packed hard by team and dog sledge and packer bringing up the freight that for another year was to last the forest people of the three river country . a domain reaching from the landing to the arctic ocean . in competition fought the drivers of revillon brothers and [female] 's bay .
my dear alicia , -- you are very good in taking notice of frederica . and i am grateful for it as a mark of your friendship . but as i can not have any doubt of the warmth of your affection . i am far from exacting so heavy a sacrifice , she is a stupid girl . and has nothing to recommend her , i would not .
when the report was over , [male] announced in his subdued . delicate voice that he had several points to bring before the meeting in regard to the commission for the reorganization of the native tribes . all attention was turned upon him , [male] cleared his throat . and not looking at his opponent , but selecting , as he always did while he was delivering his speeches . the first person sitting opposite him , an inoffensive little old man .
kutuzov did not consider any offensive necessary , the result was a compromise which was inevitable . a small detachment was sent to forminsk to attack broussier , it was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there to malo yaroslavets . the place where the last battle with the french was fought and where the obvious disintegration of [organization] began . and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign . but of dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that dubiously , and this silence about dokhturov is the clearest testimony to his merit .
he had nothing with him but his boat . and came on apace , a knot of those amphibious human creatures who appear to have some mysterious power of extracting a subsistence out of tidal water by looking at it . were gathered together about the causeway , as her father 's boat grounded . they became contemplative of the mud . and dispersed themselves , she saw that the mute avoidance had begun .
but before we began again , i laid my head well into the chamber . and there i hears a faint `` ma a ah , '' coming through some ells of snow . like a plaintive , buried hope , or a last appeal , i shouted aloud to cheer him up . for i knew what sheep it was , to wit , the most valiant of all the wethers . who had met me when i came home from [location] .
by now i had developed such skill at surgery that [female] . with a few words of advice , left me to my task with a couple of sailors for assistants . for his task he elected a vengeance on the shark . a heavy swivel hook , baited with fat salt pork , was dropped overside ; and by the time i had compressed the severed veins and arteries . the sailors were singing and heaving in the offending monster .
coffee is handed , the ladies , since the gentlemen entered . have become lively as larks ; conversation waxes brisk and [male] . colonel dent and mr. [male] argue on politics . their wives listen , the two proud dowagers , lady lynn and lady ingram , confabulate together . sir [male] -- whom , by the bye , i have forgotten to describe .
`` i was in the castle , too , '' she said . with a look of pride , the sun went down over the waters behind them . and cast their brown shadows on the road in front . the twilight deepened , the night came down , the moon rose in their faces . and the stars appeared , they could hear the tramp of the horses
nor was there hope when she awoke in the morning . there was a garden out in the suburbs ; a small , leafy corner . with a few green tables under the orange trees . an old cat slept all day on the stone step in the sun . and an old mulatresse slept her idle hours away in her chair at the open window .
immediately he calls for his best wig , hat , and sword . and ordering his man to go to the other place to make his excuse . that was to say , he made an excuse to send his man away . he prepares to go into the coach , as he was going . he stopped a while , and speaks mighty earnestly to me about his business .
she put her hand on the arm of her care worn . sallow father , and frothing her light draperies , proceeded over the eternal red carpet . her father , mute and yellowish . his [male] beard making him look more careworn . mounted the steps stiffly , as if his spirit were absent ; but the laughing mist of the bride went along with him undiminished .
the most sacred relationship in life , [male] , shall you and i enter it unadvisedly . lightly , and with lies on our lips ? ... simply because others do ? but the whole world stands for this , and the world wo not stand for that . all the same , you have got to marry me -- you have simply got to . you are mistaken , i do not have to marry any one , i can support myself .
occasionally at a stoppage the guard would look into the compartment and say to the boy . `` all right , my man , your box is safe in the van . '' the boy would say , `` yes , '' without animation , would try to smile , and fail . he was age masquerading as juvenility . and doing it so badly that his real self showed through crevices .
i led her away from the rest of them . being desirous of explaining things , when i saw the depth of her nature opened . like an everlasting well , to me , but she would not let me say a word . or do anything by ourselves , as it were . she said , your duty is to your mother .
she crept among the trees to the trunk of a tree whence she could see . beyond some intervening trees and branches . the lighted windows , both in their reality and their reflection in the water . she placed her orderly little basket at her side . and sank upon the ground , supporting herself against the tree .
in the glow of mrs. westmore 's christmas visitation an athletic club had been formed . and leave obtained to use the hopewood grounds for saturday afternoon sports . and thither amherst continued to conduct the boys after the mills closed at the week-end . his last saturday had now come : a shining afternoon of late february , with a red sunset bending above frozen river and slopes of unruffled snow . for an hour or more he had led the usual sports .
`` of course i was not there , '' said gunner . and i can not absolutely know , but i suppose you had been interfering with the duchess about [female] . [female] will bear a great deal , -- but since she has taken up politics . by [female] , you had better not touch her there , at last it came to be believed that the [male] had been turned out by the order of the duchess . because he had ventured to put himself forward as an opponent to [male] lopez .
{ 166 } [female] oglou , or [female] oglou . is the principal landholder in [location] ; he governs [location] . those who , by a kind of feudal tenure , possess land on condition of service . are called timariots : they serve as spahis . according to the extent of territory , and bring a certain number into the field , generally cavalry .
[female] and i going to church , therefore , must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds . yet , what i suffered outside was nothing to what i underwent within , the terrors that had assailed me whenever mrs. [female] had gone near the pantry . or out of the room , were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done . under the weight of my wicked secret , i pondered whether the church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the terrible young man . if i divulged to that establishment , i conceived the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said .
my father gave his last reading injames hall , [location] , on the fifteenth of march . the programme included `` the christmas carol '' and the `` trial '' from `` pickwick. '' the hall was packed by an enormous audience . and he was greeted with all the warmth which the personal affection felt for the reader inspired .
in the meantime [male] had continued his career in [location] without much immediate satisfaction . to himself , or to the lady who boasted to be his heart 's chosen queen . miss [female] roper , indeed , was becoming very cross . and in her ill temper was playing a game that was tending to create a frightful amount of hot water in [female] crescent . she was devoting herself to a flirtation with mr cradell .
but mrs. wardour was in some dread of what her son would say when he came to know what she had been doing . for , when we are not at ease with ourselves . when conscience keeps moving as if about to speak , then we dread the disapproval of the lowliest . and [male] was the only one before whom his mother felt any kind of awe . toward him , therefore , she kept silence for the present .
with that it was all up with me , a simmering buzzed in my heavy brain . and a light came through my eyeplaces , at once i set both fists again . and my heart stuck to me like cobbler 's wax . either [male] should kill me , or i would conquer [male] . so i went in again with my courage up , and [male] came smiling for victory .
she told of her own days down at school and of their appalling loneliness . of childhood spent in the forests ; of the desire to live there always . but she did not speak intimately of herself or her life in its more vital aspects . she said nothing of the home in the valley of silent men . nothing of father or mother .
what influence he exercised upon everything into contact with which i was brought . may be understood from a few detached instances , to begin with this very day on which he first joined me . after i had walked heartlessly along for two or three hours , i was very weary . and lay down to rest in a most delightful part of the forest , carpeted with wild flowers . i lay for half an hour in a dull repose .
and then [female] was wedded and carried off to the lakes , [female] , as she had promised . did stand near her ; but not exactly in the gingham frock of which she had once spoken . she wore on that occasion -- but it will be too much . perhaps , to tell the reader what she wore as [female] 's bridesmaid . seeing that a couple of pages , at least , must be devoted to her marriage dress .
in spite of the fact that the old lady had not welcomed the new day . its beauty charmed her when she went out for a walk after her dinner . or , rather , after her midday biscuit , it was so fresh . so sweet , so virgin ; and the spruce woods around the old lloyd place were athrill with busy spring doings and all sprinkled through with young lights and shadows . some of their delight found its way into the old lady 's bitter heart as she wandered through them .
he tried to look ahead , to follow up , one by one , the consequences of such a break . that it would be final he had no doubt . there are natures which seem to be drawn closer by dissension , to depend , for the renewal of understanding . on the spark of generosity and compunction that anger strikes out of both . but amherst knew that between himself and his wife no such clearing of the moral atmosphere was possible .
he pulled the raincoat up around his shoulders . and lay back stiffly , then -- he was not an imaginative man . he began to feel that eyes were staring at him . furtive , hidden eyes , intently watching him . without moving he began to [male] the cabin with his eyes .
so was the entire change from his former abasement and devotion to nan to a somewhat lordly air with his little betrothed . for [male] made an idol of him . and resented the idea of a fault or a flaw in her [male] . this new state of things suited both , and the once blighted being bloomed finely in the warm atmosphere of appreciation . love , and confidence , he was very fond of the dear girl .
she is not left , as you say , my dear . she has her husband , she has me , ', said he . some few further words passed , i do not chronicle them , sir [male] was as firm as a rock . that i was helpless before him is a matter of course . i saw my sister handed into her carriage .
bessy , as if in acknowledgment of his renunciation . rose earlier in order to prolong their rides together , [female] had counselled her against the fatigue of following the hounds . and she instinctively turned their horses away from the course the hunt was likely to take . but now and then the cry of the pack , or the flash of red on a distant slope . sent the blood to her face and made her press her mare to a [organization] .
he mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal . a friend of his father 's , the field marshal made an appointment to see him . received him graciously , and promised to inform the emperor , a few days later prince [male] received notice that he was to go to see the minister of war , count arakcheev . on the appointed day prince [male] entered count arakcheev 's waiting room at nine in the morning . he did not know arakcheev personally , had never seen him , and all he had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man .
she fancied the meeting , -- he in a cab . with the reins lightly held between the tips of his gloved fingers . and a tiny tiger swinging behind ; and she standing on the kerbstone waiting to cross the road . and not out to [male] anything vulgar . only going to pay a water rate , or to negotiate some mysterious `` backing '' of the spoons .
the overture was now begun , and [female] declined any further conversation . this was the first opera she had ever heard , yet she was not wholly a stranger to italian compositions . having assiduously studied music from a natural love of the art . attended all the best concerts her neighbourhood afforded , and regularly received from [location] the works of the best masters . but the little skill she had thus gained , served rather to increase than to lessen the surprize with which she heard the present performance .
there it was , then ; that was the last picture he was to have of her . for he knew now that he was not going back ; at least not to take up their life together . he supposed he should have to see her once , to talk things over . settle something for their future , he had been sincere in saying that he bore her no ill will . only he could never go back into that slough again , if he did .
but as the days , and still more particularly the lonely evenings , dragged along . he found himself , to his moral consternation . to be thinking more of her instead of thinking less of her , and experiencing a fearful bliss in doing what was erratic . informal , and unexpected , surrounded by her influence all day , walking past the spots she frequented . he was always thinking of her , and was obliged to own to himself that his conscience was likely to be the loser in this battle .
the sight of [location] warmed my heart with various emotions . such as a cordial man must draw from the heart of all humanity . here there are quick ways and manners , and the rapid sense of knowledge . and the power of understanding , ere a word be spoken . whereas at oare , you must say a thing three times .
one was of an old man without a beard , but with a high forehead . framed around with short grey hair , the other was of a woman with a tired look and a baby on her lap . under this there was a little [female] picture that seemed to pete to be the likeness of a fancy tombstone . and the print on it , so far as pete could spell it out . was that of a tombstone too , in loving memory of verbena .
he told himself that he had done well to find this out . and that he had been wise to act upon it , his wisdom had in truth consisted in his capacity to feel that [female] was a nice girl . clever , well minded , high principled , and full of spirit -- and in falling in love with her as a consequence . all his regard for the quiet domesticities had come from his love . and had had no share in producing it , [male] was bright eyed .
the last sentence gave rise in the duke 's mind to the necessity of a very elaborate memorandum on the subject of amusements generally . i now come to my misfortunes , i know that as a poor man i ought not to be a member of parliament . i ought to be earning my bread as a lawyer or a doctor . i have no business to be what i am , and when i am forty i shall find that i have eaten up all my good things instead of having them to eat . i have one chance before me .
hester could not but be touched with the young girl 's manner to her mother . as tender , as protecting as if their relation to each other had been reversed . and she was lulling and tenderly soothing a wayward , frightened child . she had neither eyes nor ears for any one till her mother was sitting in trembling [female] . holding her daughter 's hand tight in both of hers .
oh , perhaps it was merely that her head was running so on [female] . that she was associating every trifle with her , as if only one person wrote in that flourishing , meandering style ! it was enough to fill her mind to think from what she might have saved [female] by securing the paper . she would look at it just once more , and see if some very dense and stupid policeman could have mistaken the name . or if [female] would certainly have been dragged into notice in the affair , no !
the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for . and considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form . and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure , they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together . he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and mrs croft seemed to go shares with him in everything . and to walk for her life to do him good , [female] saw them wherever she went .
there is but one road to the favour of a [male] . and how can the poor jew find it , whom extortions have already reduced to the misery of [male] ? then , as if suspicion had overpowered his other feelings , he suddenly exclaimed . for the love of god , young man . betray me not -- for the sake of the great father who made [male] all .
`` his excellency will see you , sir , '' said the man . returning quickly with the reply , from the end of a room . so darkened by closed shutters and curtains as to make all approach difficult . a weak voice called out , ah , scaresby , how d ', ye do ? i was just thinking to myself that i could not be in [male] , since i had not seen you .
the attendant was at the door , holding the cardinal 's horse by the bridle . at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade . these were the two men who were to conduct [female] to the fort of the point . and superintend her embarkation , the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to [male] . the cardinal made an approving gesture , and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used incoming .
we returned to prudence 's box . and when the play was over we took a cab and drove to 7 , rue d'antin . at the door , prudence asked [female] to come up and see her showrooms . which we had never seen , and of which she seemed very proud , you can imagine how eagerly i accepted . it seemed to me as if i was coming nearer and nearer to marguerite .
summoning [female] , i soon had the room in more cheerful order . i prepared him , likewise , a comfortable repast . my spirits were excited , and with pleasure and ease i talked to him during supper . and for a long time after , there was no harassing restraint . no repressing of glee and vivacity with him .
he went down the broad gravel path towards the building . it was an ancient edifice of the fifteenth century . once a palace , now a training school , with mullioned and transomed windows . and a courtyard in front shut in from the road by a wall . jude opened the gate and went up to the door through which .
when [male] pressed it , he was told by lord [male] that he was a fool for his pains . by which [male] understood perfectly well that when lord [male] did go to saulsby . he , [male] , was to take that as strong evidence that everything was over for him as regarded violet effingham . when violet expressed her eagerness that the visit should be made . she was stopped with an assurance that she could have it done at once if she pleased .
in a few minutes time we were stepping out sharply across the great cultivated plain or lake bed . framed like a vast emerald in its setting of frowning cliff . and had another opportunity of wondering at the extraordinary nature of the site chosen by these old people of kor for their capital . and at the marvellous amount of labour , ingenuity , and engineering skill that must have been brought into requisition by the founders of the city to drain so huge a sheet of water . and to keep it clear of subsequent accumulations , it is .
on the journey from [location] to hampshire mrs. [female] discovered that one of their fellow passengers was well acquainted with the neighbourhood of blackwater . and could give her all the information she needed on the subject of localities . in this way she found out that the only place they could go to . which was not dangerously near to sir [male] 's residence , was a large village called sandon . the distance here from blackwater park was between three and four miles .
of course he , [male] finn . desired earnestly , -- longed in his very heart of hearts , -- to extinguish all such parliamentary influence . to root out for ever the last vestige of close borough nominations . but while the thing remained it was better that the thing should contribute to the liberal than to the conservative strength of the house . and if to the liberal , how was this to be achieved but by the acceptance of such influence by some liberal candidate ?
`` is cynthia unable to come ? '' asked he , perceiving that she expected him . `` she said she should be here , '' said mr. [male] . extremely annoyed at being entrapped as he now felt that he had been , into an interview with miss [female] . molly hesitated a little before she spoke , he was determined not to break the silence . as she had intruded herself into the affair .
other nurses were there now , capped , aproned , quickly and silently unpacking their appliances ... she must call a halt , clear her brain again . decide rapidly what was to be done next ... oh , if only the crawling hours could bring amherst ! it was strange that there was no telegram yet -- no , not strange , after all . since it was barely six in the morning , and her message had not been despatched till seven the night before .
ever since i can remember , i have been beset by a recurring doubt as to whether i be or be not quite a gentleman . i have never attempted to define that term : i have but feverishly wondered whether in its usual acceptation it be strictly applicable to myself . many people hold that the qualities connoted by it are primarily moral . a kind heart , honourable conduct . and so forth , on clio 's mission , i found honour and kindness tugging me in precisely opposite directions .
but maïeddine told her there was no need to be sorry for the sufferings of camels . since all were deserved , once , he said , they had been men . a haughty tribe who believed themselves better than the rest of the world . they broke off from the true religion , and lest their schism spread . [male] turned the renegades into camels .
`` mamma , i do not at all want to , '' replied [female] , but all the same she rose . none of them , not even the middle-aged dimmler . wanted to break off their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room . but [female] got up and [female] sat down at the clavichord . standing as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best .
the dinner was admirable as a dinner ; nothing went wrong . from the golden and excellent clear soup to the delightful iced marrons and cream . and [male] praises died away to an appreciative acquiescence . a brisk talk sprang up between capes and mr. [male] . to which the two ladies subordinated themselves intelligently , the burning topic of the mendelian controversy was approached on one or two occasions .
not to admire [female] was impossible -- to find one fault with her person or sentiments was equally impossible . and yet to love her was unlikely , miss milner had a heart affectionate to her own sex . even where she saw them in possession of superior charms . but whether from the spirit of contradiction , from feeling herself more than ordinarily offended by her guardian 's praise of this lady . or that there was a reserve in [female] that did not accord with her own [female] and ingenuous disposition .
she found him scanning her with a straight . searching look , as if seeking to discover of what sort she was . she felt he had noticed her shrinking from hughie . and was annoyed to find herself blushing under his keen gaze . but when mrs. [female] presented ranald to her niece .
edmond found some solace in these ideas . all his sorrows , all his sufferings , with their train of gloomy spectres . fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter . dantes reviewed his past life with composure . and , looking forward with terror to his future existence .
but no one dares to cast the die , and to go honestly by the hazard . there must be the actual necessity of obeying the die , before even the die can be of any use . as it was , when madame goesler had sat there for an hour . till her legs were tired beneath her , she had not resolved . it must be as her impulse should direct her when the important moment came .
for although legally a member of the brewster family . willie explained , the girl had come to belong in a sense to the entire village . had she not been cast an orphan upon its shores . and were not its treacherous shoals responsible for her misfortune ? wilton , to be sure . was not actually answerable for the crimes those hidden sand bars perpetrated .
that he had come back for her sake , we had no real light upon her circumstances at that moment . any more than we had upon her origin , which we believed to be of the sort usually spoken of as modest . cumnor had a theory that she had been a governess in some family in which the poet visited and that . in consequence of her position , there was from the first something unavowed . or rather something positively clandestine , in their relations , i on the other hand had hatched a little romance according to which she was the daughter of an artist .
i will be there soon , said mr. [male] , i have reasons for wanting to know him thoroughly . and by the way , how do you do , [male] ? how is the great investigation coming on , `` fine ! '' i am glad to hear it , push it with all your might . and finish up so we can have a month on atwater without coming back and forth . i feel as if i would need about that much swimming to make me clean .
the gentlemen signified their assent , and at the usual hour they proceeded to the church . which was situated about two miles from mr. [male] 's . we are sorry for it , but truth compels [male] to say that on this day [male] was not quite as devotional as usual . he was looking over the congregation to see what effect his brother 's presence was producing . when he saw that no one exclaimed or turned pale , and that even the minister kept on the even tenor of his discourse .
`` i can never bring myself to believe it , [female] , '' said [female] , the pretty daughter of mr. [male] . attorney of [male] , walker and winthrop was the name of the firm . and they were respectable people , who did all the solicitors business that had to be done in that part of barsetshire on behalf of the crown .
he tried to move , but found himself utterly powerless . a partial paralysis seemed to have changed his limbs to lead ; he could only lie as he had fallen . dimly conscious of the fading stars above , the faint summer wind rippling a distant streamlet . and all the vague murmur of newly awakened nature , he knew as well as if a whole conclave of physicians had announced their decision upon his case . he knew that for him life was over .
woman also , according to the depth of her yoni . is either a female deer , a mare , or a female elephant . in these unequal unions , when the male exceeds the female in point of size . his union with a woman who is immediately next to him in size is called high union . and is of two kinds ; while his union with the woman most remote from him in size is called the highest union .
neither [male] nor i were in any favorable disposition to be amused , the count 's glib cynicism had revealed a new aspect of his nature from which we both recoiled . but it was impossible to resist the comical distress of so very large a man at the loss of so very small a mouse . we laughed in spite of ourselves . and when madame [female] rose to set the example of leaving the boat house empty . so that her husband might search it to its remotest corners .
on the day following , [female] again became a messenger between the husband and wife . and before dinner time a reconciliation had been effected , of course the wife gave way at last . and of course she gave way so cunningly that the husband received none of the gratification which he had expected in her surrender . `` tell him to come , '' [male] had urged , `` of course he can come if he pleases , '' [male] had replied , then [male] had told [male] to come .
the spectator gazed on and on till the windows and vanes lost their shine . going out almost suddenly like extinguished candles , the vague city became veiled in mist . turning to the west , he saw that the sun had disappeared . the foreground of the scene had grown funereally dark , and near objects put on the hues and shapes of chimaeras . inside and round about that old woman 's `` shop '' window .
the first succeeded , because [male] sought to make him speak himself . [male] , on the contrary , because he knew how to make [male] talk . [male] was occupied in making him describe the voyage to england . and [male] had related it in all its details . with a limited number of gestures and eight words .
the males among them relieved the insipidity of the entertainment by imaginative betting . in which the stake was `` anything you like , '' on their favorite archers ; but the young maidens , having a different principle of discrimination . were considering which of those sweetly dressed ladies they would choose to be , if the choice were allowed them . probably the form these rural souls would most have striven for as a tabernacle .
they had purchased freedom , the house at [organization] was eager for them . mother cried as she ripped up the carpet in their familiar flat and saw the treasured furniture rudely crated for shipment to the unknown . she felt that she was giving up ever so many metropolitan advantages by leaving [location] so prematurely . why , she would never been inside grant 's tomb ! she would miss her second [female] -- not that she would seen the [female] for a year or two .
and who shall say that the angel of the lord did not stand within the crossing of the ways and turn aside the evil men ? [female] did not stop her fierce ride until about noon . the frenzy of her fear of pursuit had come upon her with renewed force . now that she was alone and desolate she dared not look behind her . she had been strong enough as she smiled her farewell .
as the day wore along i improved on my obstructive tactics . when the elsinore was up in the eye of the wind . and making sternway , i found that by putting the wheel sharply over , one way or the other . i could swing her bow off , then , when she had paid off till the wind was abeam . by reversing the wheel hard across to the opposite hard over i could take advantage of her momentum away from the wind and work her off squarely before it .
he flattered me by thinking that , if i took the place of colonel [male] as conductor . they would abandon their plot to desert the yacht at [location] . it was , according to [male] 's secret information . only the `` smart and would be smart set '' who had combined to spring this mine upon the management . the rest grumbled no more than it was normal for all pleasure pilgrims to grumble .
there are no conditions to which a man can not become used , especially if he sees that all around him are living in the same way . levin could not have believed three months before that he could have gone quietly to sleep in the condition in which he was that day . that leading an aimless , irrational life , living too beyond his means . after drinking to excess ( he could not call what happened at the club anything else ) . forming inappropriately friendly relations with a man with whom his wife had once been in love .
the spirit of my costume penetrated my very skin and within ten minutes more i had become something of a coxcomb . in order to feel more at ease in my new attire . i took several turns up and down the room , clari monde watched me with an air of maternal pleasure . and appeared well satisfied with her work , come , enough of this child 's play ! let [female] start , romuald , dear .
when the sunday came the red streaky period had arrived , but had by no means as yet passed away . the men at the office had almost become used to it . but crosbie , in spite of his determination to go down to the club . had not yet shown himself elsewhere , of course he did not go to church . but at five he made his appearance at the house injohn 's wood .
which might reach the busy world , towns , regions full of life i had heard of but never seen . that then i desired more of practical experience than i possessed ; more of intercourse with my kind . of acquaintance with variety of character . than was here within my reach , i valued what was good in mrs. [female] . and what was good in adele ; but i believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness .
the act of paying for his fare brought to his consciousness that he had but a little over ten dollar with him . he thrust the change back into his pocket . and took up his contemplation of nothing , the river water dripped slowly from his `` cork '' boots to form a pool on the car floor . the heavy wool of his short driving trousers steamed in the car 's warmth . his shoulders dried in a little cloud of vapor .
these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity . dantes rose , dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before . and pushed his bed back against the wall , he then gave himself up to his happiness . he would no longer be alone , he was , perhaps , about to regain his liberty . at the worst , he would have a companion , and captivity that is shared is but half captivity .
as he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit . in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of . i next discussed with him what dress he should wear . he cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of `` shorts '' as a disguise . and had in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him something between a dean and a dentist .
thus it would be easy to go on , perpetrating a score of little epigrammatical allusions . like the above , all kindly meant , but none of them quite hitting the mark . and often striking where they were not aimed , it may be allowable to say . however , that [male] art is much better represented at [male] in the pictorial than in the sculpturesque department . yet the men of marble appear to have more weight with the public than the men of canvas .
on reaching petersburg [female] did not let anyone know of his arrival . he went nowhere and spent whole days in reading [male] . whose book had been sent him by someone unknown . one thing he continually realized as he read that book . the joy , hitherto unknown to him , of believing in the possibility of attaining perfection .
' i daresay you would find it cold , replied she with a cool , immutable gravity that did not serve to reassure me . when the ceremony was concluded , she led me into the sitting room again . where she rang and sent for the children , i replied i was quite willing to do so . and at that moment my young pupils entered the apartment .
the charm of her voice and her manner . added to the touching simplicity , the pathetic truth of those words . she made me realize , as i had never realized before . what it is to have , at one and the same time , the blessing of imagination . and the curse of blindness , for a moment .
in this extremity his instinct led him to [male] . he threw away everything now -- he only wanted the relation established with her . he would follow her to the studio . to be near her , to talk to her , he would stand about the room . aimlessly picking up the implements , the lumps of clay .
when i had done so , he made me put them into my lap . and took my little drawer , and poured out all my money among his , and bade me get me gone . and carry it all home into my own chamber . we had lived thus near three months , when the company beginning to wear away at the bath . he talked of going away , and fain he would have me to go to [location] with him .
then tristan was glad , and henceforward from that day no one dared enter the wild wood . for terror guarded it and the lovers were lords of it all . and then it was that tristan fashioned his bow failnaught which struck home always . man or beast , whatever it aimed at . my lords , upon a summer day .
[female] could laugh at the present chairman of the income tax office with great freedom . and call him old ruffle scuffle and the like . but now that he was sent for , he also , in spite of his radical propensities . felt a little weak about his ankle joints , he knew . from the first hearing of the message , that he was wanted with reference to that affair at the railway station .
the day of her visit was exquisite , and the last of unclouded happiness that she was to have for many months . her anxiety about [female] 's extraordinary absence was still dormant . and as for a possible brush with miss [female] -- that only gave zest to the expedition . she had also eluded [female] 's invitation to luncheon . walking straight up from the station , she crossed the village green and entered the long chestnut avenue that connects it with the church .
he came again , and [male] leaned to help him in to the boat . [male] again watched [male] climb out of the water . but this time slowly , heavily , with the blind clambering motions of an amphibious beast , clumsy . again the moon shone with faint luminosity on his white wet figure . on the stooping back and the rounded loins , but it looked defeated now .
i never shall get to [location] if i do not hurry . the trip was like riding through a long picture gallery . full of lovely landscapes , the farmhouses were my delight . with thatched roofs , ivy up to the eaves , latticed windows . and stout women with [female] children at the doors .
we all sat silent in the places we had chosen . mrs. [female] still sleeping , miss [female] still playing . miss [female] still reading -- till the light failed us . by this time the moon had stolen round to the terrace . and soft , mysterious rays of light were slanting already across the lower end of the room .
he saw people all about her . chatting , laughing , sipping tea , and eating thin bread and butter . he saw , as if from a distance , another man . himself , in that room , standing near the piano to turn her music . while the tinkling runs and glib .
her eyes indeed were dry , but her very soul seemed to be torn in pieces within her . she rose carefully , hid the newspaper at the bottom of a trunk . and turned the key upon it , the ceremony was performed on april fifteenth . at the residence of mrs. [female] . a roman catholic priest officiating , [male] was a poor example of the faith he occasionally professed .
from time to time , on the road which they had carefully left on their left . passed fugitives coming from the interior , at the news of the landing of the royal troops . [male] and [male] , concealed behind some projecting mass of rock . collected the words that escaped from the poor people , who fled , trembling , carrying with them their most valuable effects . and tried , whilst listening to their complaints , to gather something from them for their own interest .
it is over this threshold that the dark eyes of [male] and jacqueline . [male] and [male] , [male] and his jeanne . look into the blue and the gray and the sometimes watery ones of a destroying civilization . and there it is that the shriek of a mad locomotive mingles with their age old river chants . the smut of coal drifts over their forests .
suddenly the jolting ceased , the deep stillness of the night seemed only intensified by the low panting of the animals and the soft dropping of the wet snow from the trees . `` what is it ? '' said thryng , peering from under the canvas cover . `` anything the matter ? '' the beasts stood with low swung heads . the vapor rising white from their warm bodies , wet with the melting snow . his question fell unheard , and the girl who was climbing down over the front wheel began to unhitch the team in silence .
under foot the leaves were dry , and the foliage of some holly bushes which grew among the deciduous trees was dense enough to keep off draughts . she scraped together the dead leaves till she had formed them into a large heap . making a sort of nest in the middle . into this tess crept , in the midst of these whimsical fancies she heard a new strange sound among the leaves . it might be the wind ; yet there was scarcely any wind .
before i could say a word she had turned away to her book case . and had taken from it the album that contained [female] drawings . she hesitated for a moment , holding the little volume fondly in her hands . then lifted it to her lips and kissed it . `` oh , [female] , [female] , '' i said .
athos smiled , but did not reply , five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince 's door . this door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard . ready to obey the orders of the prince [male] conti 's lieutenant . he was in bed , but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war . everywhere were swords , pistols , cuirasses , and arquebuses .
yes , the creatures might have appeared harmless enough had there been no retired colonel . but there was a retired colonel , and so deftly had he undermined my courage that almost any shock might cause it to explode in a blue flame of funk . his speech of introduction was now to come , and if i survived that , i might hope to live through my own fireworks . `` they have put on their best bibs and tuckers , '' [male] mumbled in a stage whisper .
she had her desire of him . she touched , she received the maximum of unspeakable communication in touch . dark , subtle , positively silent , a magnificent gift and give again , a perfect acceptance and yielding . a mystery , the reality of that which can never be known , vital , sensual reality that can never be transmuted into mind content . but remains outside , living body of darkness and silence and subtlety .
they would go there so early as to avoid the herd of autumnal wanderers . he knew the country , and could map out the fairest roads for their travels . the pleasantest resting places for their repose , and if clarissa cared to explore [location] afterwards . and spend october and november in [female] , she could do so , all the world would be bright and new to him with her for his companion . he looked forward with boyish eagerness to revisiting scenes that he had fancied himself weary of until now , yes .
the stable clock struck four ; in half an hour she would be here . he would have just one tiny nap , because he had had so little sleep of late . and then he would be fresh for her , fresh for youth and beauty . coming towards him across the sunlit lawn . lady in grey , and settling back in his chair he closed his eyes .
the girl was herself a small , delicate creature . but made like a model , as i folded back her plentiful yet fine hair . so shining and soft , and so exquisitely tended , i had under my observation a young . pale , weary , but high bred face , the brow was smooth and clear ; the eyebrows were distinct . but soft , and melting to a mere trace at the temples ; the eyes were a rich gift of nature .
be it so , we submit , and all is over , you are ruined . it is well ; you are dead ? no ; you are still living . on the morrow you know it well , by what ? by the pricking of a pin , yonder passer-by omits to recognise you . the tradesmen 's bills rain down upon you .
then an old man took the keys of the castle to [male] . and the knight opened the gates of the castle . and set free many prisoners , he gave the castle back to the maiden to whom it belonged . and sent for all the knights in the country round about to do her homage . then once again sir [male] rode on in search of the holy grail .
the chota rani , it seemed a century since i had been sent for by her . i kept them all waiting there , and went off into the inner apartments . when i stepped into our room i had another shock of surprise to find bimala there with a distinct suggestion of being dressed up . the room , which from persistent neglect had latterly acquired an air of having grown absent minded . had regained something of its old order this afternoon .
my eyes are dim with childish tears , my heart is idly stirred . for the same sound is in my ears which in those days i heard . thus fares it still in our decay ; and yet the wiser mind mourns less for what time takes away . than what he leaves behind , step after step lovel could trace his host 's retreat along the various passages . and each door which he closed behind him fell with a sound more distant and dead .
the count then looking over into the street , saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction . and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over . caderousse climbed the ladder slowly , and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet . no one could be seen or heard , the clock of the invalides struck one . then caderousse sat astride the coping , and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall .
i am awfully glad you did not smash up [male] altogether . because of [male] , i am quite sure it is no good anybody setting up his back against that . it 's one of the things that have got to be , you always have said that he is a good fellow . if so , what 's the harm ? at any rate it has got to be . during the following week the communications between [female] and matching were very frequent .
i did it all for you . you dare not leave me now : nay , [male] , listen . get horses ready , we will fly to night , the past is a bad dream . we will forget it : before [male] lies the future . shall we not have sweet days of love beneath our vines and laugh ?
the sight of the macquern coming out top speed from the market . with a large but inexpensive bunch of flowers , reminded him of the luncheon that was to be . never to throw over an engagement was for him , as we have seen . a point of honour , but this particular engagement . hateful , when he accepted it , by reason of his love .
now the first person out of the house to notice [male] 's change of look and manner was [male] . and yet he did not see her until , under the influence of the nauseous mixture . she was beginning to recover , but his eyes were scarcely off her during the first five minutes he was in the room . all the time he was trying to talk to mrs. [female] in reply to her civil platitudes . he was studying [male] ; and at the first convenient pause he came and stood before molly .
they had not closed up half the distance between them and the house when two horsemen rode suddenly round the corner of the l and through the wide gate in the picket fence . outside the fence they separated with the suddenness of a preconcerted plan . darting away in opposite directions , each wore a white hat , and from that distance they appeared as much alike in size and bearing as a man and his reflection . the sheriff swore a surprised oath at sight of them . and their cunning plan to confuse and divide the pursuing force .
two words let fall by [male] in theluke 's covered market on saturday morning had increased and multiplied till the whole town echoed with the news . [male] 's private fortune rose as high as a quarter of a million . as for [male] mynors , it was said that [male] mynors knew what he was about . after all , he was like the rest , money , money ! of course it was inconceivable that a fine , prosperous figure of a man .
youth and vigor , he told himself . must always exist under those unpolluted lights of the upper worlds , the unspeaking things which had told him more than he had ever learned from the mouths of other men . they stood for his religion , his faith . his belief in the existence of things greater than the insignificant spark which animated his own body . he appreciated them most when there was stillness .
when the august aunt returned at the end of an hour with the ladies . surrounded by the attendants with their instruments of music . the round faced beauty was seated in the chair that she herself had occupied . and on the whiteness of her brow was hung the chain of pearls . which had formed the frontal of the cap of the emperor .
the next day was sunday , and they all went to church . [female] felt that [female] was there , too , but she never raised her eyes to glance at him . he had been looking out in vain for a sight of her . now from the oak tree , now from his bay mare 's back , as he haunted the roads about thornwick . now from the window of the little public house where the path across the fields joined the main road to testbridge .
one day [male] dropped , coatless , into farquaharson 's room and grinned as he tossed a magazine down on the table . `` sic fama est '' was his comment , and stuart picked up the sheet which his visitor indicated with a jerk of the thumb . the magazine was a weekly devoted ostensibly to the doings of smart society . but its real distinction lay in its innuendo and its genius for sailing so close to the wind of libel that those who moved in the rarified air of exclusiveness read it with a delicious and shuddering mingling of anticipation and dread . its method was to use no names in the more daring paragraphs .
[female] would not have been capable of a vengeance so mean , strange how she had grown so gentle and so good under the constant persecution of this thieving gang ! her conscience was as clear as a windowpane ; a man could look through her soul and see the world undisturbed by a flaw beyond it . a good girl ; she sure was a good girl . and as pretty a figure on a horse as man 's eye ever followed . she had said once that she felt it lonesome out there by the fence .
her cheeks were very pink when she stood beside mckay . with father [female] before them , the open book in his hands . and then , as her long lashes drooped over her eyes , and her breath came a little more quickly . she saw [female] staring at her questioningly . and made a little motion to him with her hand .
i learnt the latter language in order to help to teach it to him . but after five years of it he knew it as well as i did . almost as well as the professor who instructed [male] both , i always was a great sportsman . it is my one passion -- and every autumn we went away somewhere shooting or fishing . sometimes to scotland , sometimes to norway , once even to [location] , i am a good shot .
i knew not what had aroused me , but i found myself out of my bunk . on my feet , wide awake , my soul vibrating to the warning of danger as it might have thrilled to a trumpet call . i threw open the door , the cabin light was burning low . i saw maud , my maud . straining and struggling and crushed in the embrace of [female] arms .
with one stride he overtook his wife . and mother and child lay together on the floor . i must say for him that , even in his drunkenness . he did not strike his wife as he would have struck a man . it was an open handed blow he gave her .
he stayed not after their departure longer than decency required . for too much in earnest was his present pursuit , to fit him for such conversation as the house in [male] 's absence could afford him . the next day , between eleven and twelve o'clock , mr monckton was again in portman square . he found , as he expected , both the ladies . and he found , as he feared , mr arnott prepared to be of their party .
she had lost track of the weeks or the months when she reached her first great city . the only one she had come near in her uncharted wanderings , into the outskirts of [location] she rode undaunted . her head erect , with the carriage of a queen . she had passed indians and cowboys in her journeying . why should she mind [location] ? miles and miles of houses and people .
fred parsons -- that was his name -- was a meagre little man about thirty five . a high and prominent forehead rose above a small pointed face , and a scanty growth of blonde beard and moustache did not conceal the receding chin nor the red sealing wax lips . his faded yellow hair was beginning to grow thin , and his threadbare frock coat hung limp from sloping shoulders . but these disadvantages were compensated by a clear bell like voice , into which no trace of doubt ever seemed to come . and his mind was neatly packed with a few religious and political ideas , he had been in business in the west end .
he welcomed [male] like a long-lost friend . between [male] and the humans who provided him with dog biscuits and occasionally with sweet cakes there had always existed a state of misunderstanding which no words could remove . the position of the humans was quite clear ; they had elected [male] to his present position on a straight watch dog ticket . they expected him to be one of those dogs who rouse the house and save the spoons . they looked to him to pin burglars by the leg and hold on till the police arrived .
[female] yield , or i die . shall true hearts be fancy 's fuel ? [male] had no sooner ended his sonnet . but [male] with a low courtesy rose up and went with his fellow . and shut their sheep in the folds ; and after returning to [male] and [male] . conducted them home weary to his poor cottage .
once outside -- and he fled immediately -- he wished that he had spoken to them . what was his life ? what were a few angry words , or even imprisonment ? he had done wrong -- that was the true terror , whatever they might know . he would tell them everything he knew . he re enteredpaul 's , but they had moved in his absence .
the other , not less magnificently attired , wore an imperial portrait suspended by a chain around her neck . and a small knot of white and green ribbon on her shoulder . to denote her quality of a lady in waiting at court . there was something almost queenly in the haughty dignity of her manner . and an air of command in the tone with which she addressed her companion .
by midnight everybody was fagged out , and sore with laughing . and , as a rule , drunk : some weepingly , some affectionately , some hilariously . some quarrelsomely , some dead and under the table , of the ladies , the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess . whose wedding eve this was ; and indeed she was a spectacle , sure enough , just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the young daughter of the regent d'orleans . at the famous dinner whence she was carried .
could [male] be a [male] , and yet feel this horrible dread of the death which must separate him from his daughter ? i fear this frail , consumptive widower loved his child with an intensity of affection that is scarcely reconcilable with christianity . such great passions as these must be put away before the cross can be taken up . and the troublesome path followed , in all love and kindness towards his fellow creatures . in all patient endurance of the pains and troubles that befel himself .
with that came his mother , the queen of orkney . dame morgawse , and when she saw sir gareth readily in the visage she might not weep . but suddenly fell down in a swoon , and lay there a great while like as she had been dead . and then sir gareth recomforted his mother in such wise that she recovered and made good cheer . then the king commanded that all manner of knights that were under his obeissance should make their lodging right there for the love of his nephews .
at last he strode beneath a lamp not far away , he looked up . but , of course , could not see her against the dark wall . for a long time he stood motionless beneath the light . she could not help seeing that he was dejected , tired , unhappy , his shoulders drooped . and there as a general air of listlessness about the figure which had once been so full of courage and of hope .
in felipe 's overwrought frame of mind this seemed to him a terrible omen . and he set out on his journey with a still heavier heart than before . he believed ramona was dead , buried in some unknown , unconsecrated spot . never to be found ; yet he would not give up the search , as he journeyed southward . he began to find persons who had known of alessandro .
courtiers , becoming every instant more numerous , succeeded one another , day and night . in the little house of the bridge of [male] . in which the cardinal had established his residence , there were monks who wore the frock with such an ill [male] that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant . women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms . and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs .
for along that bank the dhows were moored and they were numerous . the river traffic , such as there was of it . had its harbour there , and the wide foreshore made a convenient market place . thus the open space between the river and [organization] was thronged and clamorous all day . captives rubbed elbows with their friends .
she gazed intently at a notice hanging on the gold encrusted wall opposite . `` ... to say all kinds of things , '' she added . writing each word with the painstaking of a child . but , when she raised her eyes again to meditate the next sentence . she was aware of a waitress , whose expression intimated that it was closing time .
as he looked it over milt felt that his wardrobe already contained all these gentlemanly possessions . with the aid of the clerk and the chart he purchased a tradition haunted garment with a plate armor bosom and an opening as crooked as the [location] river . a white tie which in his strong red hands looked as silly as a dead fish . waistcoat , pearl links , and studs . for the first time , except for seizures of madness during two or three visits to [location] motor accessory stores .
it was settled , then , well , he would be reasonable ; he would not stand in her way . he would let her go , for two years he had been living some other . luckier man 's life ; the time had come when he must drop back into his own . he no longer tried to look ahead , to grope his way through the endless labyrinth of his material difficulties . a sense of dull resignation closed in on him like a fog .
the confession of her heart 's secret burst from her in those pleading words . i had no right to hear them . no right to answer them -- they were the words that banished me . in the name of her sacred weakness , from the room . it was all over , i dropped her hand .
after a time [organization] got up and took his leave . he was confused and irritated , here , whether creditably or not , was [male] livingstone accounted for . there was a story there , probably , but not the story he was after . this unknown had been at the ranch when [male] died , had perhaps been indirectly responsible for his death . he had , witness the horse , fled after the thing happened .
she knew they were united -- she and her [female] . under the sweet dominion of [female] , to look at mrs. [female] filled her . somehow , with recollections of her pious childhood ; she saw herself in the old shop . moving again in an atmosphere of prayer , listening to the beautiful story . in the annunciation of which her life had grown up , she answered her [female] 's questions in sweet light heartedness of spirit .
this discovery -- natural enough when one began to think over it , but incredible at first . astounded [female] all , for maud -- well was it that the little [female] seated in her lap hid and controlled in some measure the violent agitation of poor auntie maud . ay -- maud loved him , perhaps she had guessed the secret cause of his departure . and love creates love often times , then his brave renunciation of rank . fortune , even of herself -- women glory in a moral hero .
the mysterious , enchanting [female] herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceived himself to be . and , above all , such an ordinary , in no way striking person , moreover , his attitude to [male] in the past . the attitude of a grown-up person to a child . arising from his friendship with her brother -- seemed to him yet another obstacle to love . an ugly , good natured man , as he considered himself .
exactly at half past eleven she entered the little breakfast parlour which looked out over the park . it was the prettiest room in the house . and now , at this springtide , when the town trees were putting out their earliest greens . and were fresh and bright almost as country trees , it might be hard to find a prettier chamber . mr [male] was there already , sitting with the morning paper in his hand .
mrs. hope and the doctor were not hard to persuade , in [location] . people keep their lamps of enjoyment filled and trimmed . so to speak , and their travelling energies ready girt about them . and easily adopt any plan which promises pleasure , the following day was fixed for the start . and clover packed her valise and [female] 's bag .
a spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and . strange as it may seem , just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join . physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within . prince [male] 's last days had bound princess [female] and [female] together . this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another , princess [female] put off her departure .
clown , he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical : a great man . i will warrant ; i know by the picking on 's teeth , [location] . the fardel there ? what 's i the fardel ? wherefore that box ? shepherd . sir . there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the king .
the story of young arundel 's life began when he was a light hearted . heedless lad of seventeen , newly escaped for a brief interval from the care of his pastors and masters . the lad had come to [location] on a christmas visit to his father 's sister . a worldly minded widow , with a great many sons and daughters . and an income only large enough to enable her to keep up the appearances of wealth essential to the family pride of one of the arundels of dangerfield .
while the marquis was reading this letter , the marchioness . who supposed the delay occasioned by some opposition from [female] . flew to the apartment , by her orders all the habitable parts of the castle were explored . and she herself assisted in the search . at length the intelligence was communicated to the chapel , and the confusion became universal .
at this especial meeting they intended to draw up a petition to the school trustees . humbly praying that a fence be put around the school grounds . and a plan was also to be discussed for planting a few ornamental trees by the church . if the funds of the society would permit of it . for , as [female] said , there was no use in starting another subscription as long as the hall remained blue .
those who had secured seats the evening before kept it waiting . some even were still in bed in their houses , hivert called . shouted , swore ; then he got down from his seat and went and knocked loudly at the doors . the wind blew through the cracked windows , the four seats . however , filled up , the carriage rolled off ; rows of apple trees followed one upon another .
this was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something very like regret . she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent . but had not the courage for it , at length however . the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm . while mrs. [female] replied that he was .
the fairy , that is to say , their mother , had already paid her visit . and in each he saw a brand-new and shining ten sou piece , the man straightened himself up . and was on the point of withdrawing , when far in , in the darkest corner of the hearth . he caught sight of another object . he looked at it , and recognized a wooden shoe .
simply that they were to get out of there and put up that fence again . and the quicker the better , bannon tried to tell him that the railroad had consented to their putting in the gallery . that they were well within their rights , that he . the section boss , had better be careful not to exceed his instructions . but the section boss had spoken his whole mind already .
phoebus was not dead , however , men of that stamp die hard . when master [male] lheulier . advocate extraordinary of the king , had said to poor esmeralda ; `` he is dying , '' it was an error or a jest . when the archdeacon had repeated to the condemned girl ; `` he is dead , ''
thus it is , and we sacrifice ourselves for these visions . which are almost always illusions for the sacrificed , but illusions with which , after all . the whole of human certainty is mingled , we throw ourselves into these tragic affairs and become intoxicated with that which we are about to do , who knows ? we may succeed , we are few in number . we have a whole army arrayed against us .
she went into the room , and stopped suddenly a few paces from the doorway . a gentleman was standing before the wide empty fireplace , where there was a great dog stove of ironwork and brass which consumed about half a ton of coal a day in winter . a tall , ponderous looking man , with his hands behind him . glancing downward with cold gray eyes , but not in the least degree inclining his stately head to listen to lady [male] . who was seated on a sofa near him , fanning herself and prattling gaily after her usual vivacious manner .
mary got up and went to mrs. arundel , who opened her arms to receive her son 's young wife . but before she folded [female] to her friendly breast . she took the girl 's two hands in hers . and looked earnestly at her pale , wasted face , she gave a long sigh as she contemplated those wan features . the shining light in the eyes , that looked unnaturally large by reason of the girl 's hollow cheeks .
nor was he called upon to do so , as he never got as far as that lady 's house . while walking up the high street he saw mrs. thorne in her carriage . and , as a matter of course , he stopped to speak to her . he knew mrs. thorne quite as intimately as he did her husband . and liked her quite as well , [female] grantly , she said .
and sliding from the bed before i could hinder her . she crossed the room , walking very uncertainly , threw it back . and bent out , careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife . i entreated , and finally attempted to force her to retire , but i soon found her delirious strength much surpassed mine ( she was delirious . i became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings ) , there was no moon .
`` you do know her , and she helps you better than anyone else could , '' answered laurie , looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his [male] eyes that beth suddenly turned very red . and hid her face in the sofa cushion . quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery , jo let laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her beth . who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment , so laurie did his best .
he took his usual poor eighteenpennyworth of food in his usual indigestive way . and had as little to say for himself as ever a wonderful man had , fortunately lord [male] was one of those sublimities who have no occasion to be talked to . for they can be at any time sufficiently occupied with the contemplation of their own greatness . this enabled the bashful young member to keep his eyes open long enough at a time to see his dinner . but , whenever lord [male] spoke , he shut them again .
although a great deal has been written on the subject of the courtesan . nowhere will be found a better description of her , of her belongings , of her ideas . and of the working of her mind , than is contained in the following pages . the details of the domestic and social life of the early hindoos would not be complete without mention of the courtesan . and part vi , is entirely devoted to this subject .
here mr. [male] 's speech died away into an ominous growl . and [male] , who was rather a timid young man , felt as if drops of cold water had been running down his back . but the rum punch was very nice ; and he saw no reason why he should refuse mr. [male] 's offer of friendship . he did drop in very often , having plenty of leisure evenings in which to amuse himself . and through him [male] was enabled to become familiar with every detail of the household at [male] castle .
another avalanche of wind gathered at their heels . driving them on like the crest of a flood . in the first force of it jolly [male] stumbled and fell to his knees . and in that moment he saw very faintly the glow of his light at the opening in the snow dune . a realization of his deadly peril if he lost sight of the light flashed upon him .
[male] face was solemn , but [male] winked as he pocketed the money . `` if i have any luck , i will bring her something that will do her more good than the oranges , '' he muttered , as he hurried off to the pasture . [male] had a horse of his own now , a rather bony nag . answering to the name of dan , [male] had agreed to pasture the animal if [male] used him in the farm work .
the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr. [male] . there was intimacy between them , and mr. [male] had heard from mr. [male] since his going away . emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone . and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went . and how full the master of the ceremonies ball had been .
[female] had been smiling at the swiftly made image , and she smiled still . but with a touch of something else than amusement . as she said -- thank you . but you have never done anything i did not like . i hardly think he could , belonging to you , she added .
this last expression of [female] 's conveyed a terrible doubt . it alarmed [female] more than a menace would have done . for it was a warning , the cardinal . then , was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him . he opened his mouth to reply , but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him .
all these suppositions , as you may see , were improbable enough ; but whatever might have been the reason of her consent . one thing was certain , she had consented , it was impossible to stay indoors . my room seemed too small to contain my happiness , i needed the whole of nature to unbosom myself . i went out , passing by the rue d'antin . i saw marguerite 's coupe
i have been walking and talking and having tea with a man . and with a very superior man -- with mr. [male] of the house of [female] . her uncle , in short ( in long , perhaps i ought to say ; he 's as tall as you . ) being in town on business , he decided to run out to the college and call on his niece . he 's her father 's youngest brother .
why the locks should have been so difficult to open , however , was still something remarkable . for she could now manage them with perfect ease . in this there was surely something mysterious , and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute . till the possibility of the door 's having been at first unlocked , and of being herself its fastener . darted into her head , and cost her another blush .
sammy got the letters the next day . and read them over and over , as she rode slowly through the sweet smelling woods . the last one told her that ollie was coming home on a visit . `` thursday , that 's the day after tomorrow , '' she said aloud . then she read the letter again , it was a very different letter from those ollie had written when first he left the woods .
my history of the affair at glenarm has overrun the bounds i had set for it . and these , i submit , are not days for the desk and pen . [female] is turning over the sheets of manuscript that lie at my left elbow . and demanding that i drop work for a walk abroad . my grandfather is pacing the terrace outside , planning , no doubt .
in the little german watering place to which the shtcherbatskys had betaken themselves . as in all places indeed where people are gathered together , the usual process . as it were , of the crystallization of society went on . assigning to each member of that society a definite and unalterable place . just as the particle of water in frost .
`` i am glad of that , '' said ethne . and she bade willoughby wait within the enclosure until she returned . and went out by herself to see that the way was clear , the garden was quite empty . durrance had disappeared from it , and the great stone terrace of the house and the house itself . with its striped sunblinds , looked a place of sleep .
he felt himself fully capable of unravelling each clue to information . and deciding on the value of the knowledge so gained , but during the leisure of the voyage he had wisely determined to communicate everything he learnt about dickinson . in short , every step he took in the matter . by letter to his employers , and thus his mind both in and out of his lodgings might have appeared to have been fully occupied with the concerns of others . but there were times when the miserable luxury of dwelling upon his own affairs was his .
when she was left alone she waited patiently , but jude did not come back . at last she started , the coast being clear , and on passing the poulterer 's shop . not far off , she saw her pigeons in a hamper by the door . an emotion at sight of them . assisted by the growing dusk of evening , caused her to act on impulse .
soon after the little episode of the boots eames left his office . and walked home alone to [male] crescent . he felt that he had gained a victory in sir [male] 's room . but the victory there had been easy , now he had another battle on his hands . in which , as he believed , the achievement of victory would be much more difficult .
she was angry with herself afterwards . thinking that he , unaware of her grave reasons for liking this seclusion . might have mistaken her meaning , she had spoken so earnestly to him . as if his presence were somehow a factor in her wish . her misgiving was such that at dusk , when the milking was over .
she loved those magic colors , like sparkling jewels dazzling to the eye . which youth can see , and never sees again when reality , the hideous hag . appears with witnesses accompanied by the mayor , to live the very poetry of love and not to see the lover . ah , what sweet intoxication , what visionary rapture ! a chimera with flowing man and outspread wings !
felipe also had witnessed the scene in the garden walk . hearing voices , he had looked out of his window . and , almost doubting the evidence of his senses , had seen his mother violently dragging ramona by the arm . ramona pale , but strangely placid ; his mother with rage and fury in her white face . the sight told its own tale to felipe , smiting his forehead with his hand .
but mrs. [female] , as usual , held on to mrs. wilkins . and presently , having cooled down in the train , mrs. wilkins announced that at san salvatore mrs. [female] would find her level . `` i see her finding her level there , '' she said , her eyes very bright . whereupon mrs. [female] . sitting with her quiet hands folded , turned over in her mind how best she could help mrs. wilkins not to see quite so much .
within that year his class had somehow stopped referring to him as a snob . after a few years [male] 's university decided that it had shone long enough in the reflected glory of his neckties . so they declaimed to him in latin . charged him ten dollar for the paper which proved him irretrievably educated . and sent him into the turmoil with much self confidence .
the carriage had stopped beside one of the small islands that intersect the place . a group of pedestrians were crowded upon it . under the light of the electric lamp -- wayfarers who . like themselves , were awaiting a passage , loder took a cursory glance at them . then turned back to eve , for a while they sat silent .
no response from the bed , but [female] 's hand groped for the wall . touched it , then dropped listlessly back , [female] could not realise that she was `` nurse gray . '' she only longed that her poor boy need not be bothered with the woman ! it all seemed , at this moment , a thing apart from herself and him . then [male] 's instinctive chivalry struggled up through the blackness .
why , she asked herself , should mr maguire trouble himself further . now that he knew that she had no fortune ? but , in truth , it was not so easy to satisfy mr maguire on that point . as it was to satisfy miss mackenzie herself . he believed that the relatives of his lady love were robbing her .
even as he spoke , clang , clang , went the bell . and for the second time that day i went toward the train for [male] . this time no wrong turning , no mistake . [male] put me into an empty compartment . and followed me , said something to a guard who went past .
the voice of the people , which is often silent with regard to the monuments raised to kings . has given to some parts of this island names which will immortalize the loss of [location] . near the isle of amber , in the midst of sandbanks . is a spot called the pass of the saint geran , from the name of the vessel which was there lost . the extremity of that point of land which you see yonder .
as the letter fluttered out of his hand [male] closed his eyes with a twitch of physical suffering . then he picked up the letter again and scrutinized it very carefully from the severe silver monogram to the huge gothic signature . but he could not find one single thing that he was looking for . not a nourishing paragraph ; not a stimulating sentence ; not even so much as one small sweet flavored word that was worth filching out of the prosy text to tuck away in the pockets of his mind for his memory to munch on in its hungry hours . now everybody who knows anything at all knows perfectly well that even a business letter does not deserve the paper which it is written on unless it contains at least one significant phrase that is worth waking up in the night to remember and think about .
the housewives admired her economy . the patients her politeness , the poor her charity . but she was eaten up with desires , with rage , with hate . that dress with the narrow folds hid a distracted fear . of whose torment those chaste lips said nothing .
he was half frightened at the directness with which he had expressed the thing . he would gladly have buried his own curiosity and all of o'connor 's suspicions for another moment of her hand on his forehead . but it was out , and he waited , she was looking down . her fingers twisting some sort of tasseled dress ornament in her lap . and kent mentally measured the length of her lashes with a foot rule in mind .
they were at the gate of ballawhaine by this time . and [male] went through it giggling , the following evening found [male] at the manx fairy ', again . [male] was there as usual , and he was laughing and talking in a low tone with [male] . this made [male] squirm on his chair . but [male] 's behaviour tortured him .
hence [female] believed poor `` similar '' to be dead , and that a month or two had elapsed since her death . let [female] add that for the last few moments the captain had been reflecting on the profound darkness of the night . the supernatural ugliness , the sepulchral voice of the strange messenger . that it was past midnight ; that the street was deserted . as on the evening when the surly monk had accosted him .
he tortured himself to find out how he could make his declaration to her . and always halting between the fear of displeasing her and the shame of being such a coward . he wept with discouragement and desire . then he took energetic resolutions , wrote letters that he tore up . put it off to times that he again deferred .
they removed their prisoner to the ground and then commenced a systematic rifling of the vessel . this operation required several hours , during which time a number of the chariots were requisitioned to transport the loot . which consisted in arms , ammunition , silks , furs . jewels , strangely carved stone vessels . and a quantity of solid foods and liquids .
one afternoon , late in the month , when the march winds were bleaker and more pitiless than usual . [male] went across the meadows where the hedgerows were putting forth timid little buds to be nipped by the chill breezes . and where here and there a violet made a tiny speck of purple on the grassy bank . mr. [male] was standing on the bridge when [male] approached the familiar trysting place . and turned with a smile to greet her , but although he smiled as he pressed the slender little hand that almost always trembled in his own .
from this the reader will understand that [male] was still fidgeting himself and the lawyer about the estate when he passed through [location] . the matter in dispute , however , was so important that he was induced to seek the advice of others besides mr. [male] . and at last was brought to the conclusion that it was his paramount duty to become [male] of [male] . there seemed in the minds of all these councillors to be some imperative and almost imperious requirement that the acres should go back to a man of his name . now , as there was no one else of the family who could stand in his way .
on getting back to the house i informed miss [female] of what i intended to do . she looked surprised and uneasy while i was explaining my purpose . but she made no positive objection to the execution of it . she only said , `` i hope it may end well , '' just as she was leaving me again . i stopped her to inquire , as calmly as i could .
only now did [female] realize the full strength of life in man and the saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to another . which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit . at midday on the twenty second of october [male] was going uphill along the muddy . slippery road , looking at his feet and at the roughness of the way . occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again at his feet .
the chemist turned sharp to the right at the head of these steps . and , passing through the opened gateway of an arch in a low gray wall . led his friends into a garden in which were growing a profusion of flowers . these flowers , they noticed , were most of them blue or gray . or of a pale silvery whiteness , lending to the scene a peculiarly wan .
[female] a dozen bread and butter plates from the ten cent store . they were adorned with cupids and roses and much gilt . but [female] was disappointed , no display , no pomp and ceremony . just a simple white dress and white veil , [female] did not understand that the veil had been in the [female] family for generations . and that the dress was an heirloom also , it was worn because grandmother [female] had given it to her .
the king offered his arm to mademoiselle [male] mancini . and made a sign to the coachman and lackeys to proceed . it was nearly six o'clock ; the road was fresh and [male] . tall trees with their foliage still inclosed in the golden down of their buds . let the dew of morning filter from their trembling branches .
for the boy was deeply impressed by this sudden eclipse of the firefly whose light and life all missed when they were gone . and lured her out every day for long drives behind the [female] mare . who shook her silvery bells till they made such [female] music [female] could not help listening to it . and whisked her over the snowy roads at a pace which set the blood dancing in her veins and sent her home strengthened and comforted by [male] . fresh air , and congenial society -- three aids young sufferers seldom can resist .
a three weeks residence at delaford . where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty six and seventeen . brought him to barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in marianne 's looks . all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother 's language . to make it cheerful , among such friends , however , and such flattery .
mine sought to penetrate the blinds and window curtains of all the palaces before which we were passing . serapion doubtless attributed this curiosity to my admiration of the architecture . for he slackened the pace of his animal in order to give me time to look around me . at last we passed the city gates and commenced to mount the hill beyond . when we arrived at its summit i turned to take a last look at the place where clarimonde dwelt .
happily for [female] she returned to the office to find that by some obscure parliamentary maneuver the vote had once more slipped beyond the attainment of women . mrs. [female] was in a condition bordering upon frenzy . the duplicity of ministers , the treachery of mankind . the insult to womanhood , the setback to civilization . the ruin of her life 's work .
what really happened we do not know , but the agreed surmise is that it was some stroke of the heart . and yet , after the stroke , did he not come out on deck ? or could the first stroke have been followed by another and fatal one after i had helped him inside through the door ? and even so , i have never heard of a heart stroke being preceded hours before by a weakening of the mind . captain [male] 's mind seemed quite clear , and must have been quite clear , that last afternoon when he wore the elsinore and started the lee shore drift .
he ventured to think that evidence as to the character of such a nature . so strong , so convincing , so complete , and so free from all objection . had never yet been given in a criminal court , at six o'clock he completed his speech . and it was computed that the old man had been on his legs very nearly seven hours . it was said of him afterwards that he was taken home speechless by one of his daughters and immediately put to bed .
the idea that i could not stand by him . the fact that he was not prosperous , not stainless before the world . that mine would be no ordinary flourishing , meaningless marriage . in which `` for better , for worse '' signifies nothing but better , no worse . all this poured strength on strength into my heart .
the moment the monarchic's name was brought up she remembered reading a newspaper paragraph about the last voyage of that great ship from [location] to liverpool . fortunately or unfortunately , her recollection of the paragraph was nebulous , for when she read news aloud to her [female] she permitted her mind to wander . unless the subject happened to be interesting , she tried to keep up a vaguely intelligent knowledge of world politics . but small events and blatant sensations , such as murders . burglaries , and `` society '' divorces , she quickly erased from her brain .
to his relief [male] acquiesced , he had become oddly passive . he seemed indeed not greatly interested , he did not even notice the haste with which [organization] removed the evidences of their meal . or extinguished the dying fire and scattered the ashes , nor , when they were mounted . the care with which they avoided the trail . he gave , when asked , information as to the direction of the railroad at the foot of the western slope of the range .
these dramas were performed with such an air of reality that you might have fancied yourself transported to the plains of [location] or of palestine . we were not unfurnished with decorations , lights , or an orchestra . suitable to the representation , the scene was generally placed in an open space of the forest . the diverging paths from which formed around [male] numerous arcades of foliage . under which we were sheltered from the heat all the middle of the day .
lightly as she tried to speak of the future , she did on this occasion allow her lover to perceive that he was indeed very dear to her . and that the coldness which had sometimes wounded him was little more than a veil beneath which a proud woman strove to hide her deepest feelings . mr. [male] rather liked this quality of pride in his future wife . even if it were carried so far as to be almost a blemish , it would be the surest safe guard of his home in the time to come . such women are not prone to petty faults , or given to small quarrels .
she looked at the clock : it was just three . the hour at which she was to relieve miss mace . she smoothed the hair from her forehead . straightened her cap , tied on the apron she had laid aside ... as she entered [female] 's sitting room the nurse came out .
`` that is true , '' she said to herself , with a thrill of strange , fatal elation . as they walked , he seemed to lift her nearer and nearer to himself . till she moved upon the firm vehicle of his body . he was so strong , so sustaining , and he could not be opposed , she drifted along in a wonderful interfusion of physical motion . down the dark , blowy hillside , far across shone the little yellow lights of beldover .
let the reader accompany me in imagination to a rather prim looking brick mansion . situated on the principal street , but at some distance back , being separated from it by a front yard . between this yard and the fence , ran a prim looking hedge of very formal cut . being cropped in the most careful manner , lest one twig should by chance have the presumption to grow higher than its kindred . it was a two story house .
in the morning sir [male] made himself ready to depart . and the maid [female] lingered long about her brother . and would never say that she had really buckled the last strap of his armour . then , when at length she could keep them no longer . she came up to sir [female] , with a face all pale and red by turns .
as he rode up to the hall door . dr fillgrave was getting into his carriage . they had never met so as to speak to each other since that memorable day . when they had their famous passage of arms in the hall of that very house before which they both now stood . but , at the present moment , neither of them was disposed to renew the fight .
he came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber . he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty . who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace . in this waiting room were five or six of the cardinals guards . who recognized [male] , and knowing that it was he who had wounded [male] .
i laughed , and changed the subject , i had no particular desire to kill lorquas ptomel . and less to be a jed among the tharks , i accompanied sola and dejah thoris in a search for new quarters . which we found in a building nearer the audience chamber and of far more pretentious architecture than our former habitation . we also found in this building real sleeping apartments with ancient beds of highly wrought metal swinging from enormous gold chains depending from the marble ceilings . the decoration of the walls was most elaborate , and , unlike the frescoes in the other buildings i had examined .
[female] was up early the next morning , she had agreed to put [female] in battle array for her visit to rittenhouse square . [female] submitted meekly to her borrowed adornings , her hair was brushed over her face . and curled on a hot iron , and brushed backward in a perfect mat , and then puffed out in a bigger pompadour than usual . the silk waist was put on with [female] 's best skirt . and she was adjured not to let that drag , then the best hat with the cheap pink plumes was set atop the elaborate coiffure .
he gave his flask to the elders of the village . they grew eloquent , and wreathed him about with flowers . gifts and loans , not all seemly , were thrust upon him . and infernal music rolled and maddened round red fires . while singers sang songs of the ancient times .
mrs. [female] was no more in love with conway [female] than she was in love with king [male] on horseback at charing cross . and , over and beyond the protection which came to her in the course of nature from unimpassioned feelings in this special phase of her life . and indeed , i may say , in every phase of her life . it must be acknowledged on her behalf that she did enjoy that protection which comes from what we call principle . though the principle was not perhaps very high of its kind , madalina demolines had been right when she talked of her friend maria 's principles .
sir [male] answered him naught . and then they dressed their spears and spurred their horses . and ran so fiercely each against the other that both were smitten to the ground . both horses and men , but sir [organization] had struck a great wound in the side of sir [male] . yet so eager was the young knight that he knew not of it .
they passed no more vessels , if afar off , in the direction of guernsey or in that ofmalo . any vessels were at sea outside the fog . the durande , submerged in the dense cloud . must have been invisible to them ; while her long trail of smoke attached to nothing . looked like a [female] comet in the pale sky .
her way back to the house was by a path through a young plantation of tapering firs . which had been planted some years earlier to shelter the premises from the north wind . by reason of the density of the interwoven foliage overhead . it was gloomy there at cloudless noontide , twilight in the evening . dark as midnight at dusk .
instead of his loud tormenting mood , he showed an intense . vague terror , and seemed to deprecate [male] 's anger . because the money was all gone -- he had been robbed -- it had half of it been taken from him . he had only come here because he was ill and somebody was hunting him . somebody was after him he had told nobody anything .
outside , there was the same cold stillness and the same moon , but even brighter than before . the light was so strong and the snow sparkled with so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real stars were unnoticed . the sky was [male] and dreary , while the earth was gay . from the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps . the bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard the voice of an old maidservant saying .
moreover , these few weeks had been a flash of lightning . there had been no time for anything except love . in short , having weighed everything , turned everything over in his mind . examined everything , whatever might have been the consequences if he had told cosette about the gorbeau ambush . even if he had discovered that [male] was a convict .
that night two knives and two pistols were whipped out by two of them in the same store . one of the ludlows promptly blew out the light and astutely got under the counter . when the combatants scrambled outside , he locked the door and crawled out the back window . next morning the brick yard malcontents marched triumphantly again and [male] called for volunteers to arrest them . to his disgust only logan , macfarlan , the hon .
i avoided looking at [female] as i said the last word . he made no answer , but in a little time he came and leaned over my chair . [male] , you are a wise counsellor . a brother born for adversity . i have been vexing myself a good deal about my future .
at each side of the piano was a small door . and he opened one of these just enough to discover that it was a wardrobe closet . a third door opened on the shore side of the bateau . but this was locked , shut out from the view of the lower end of the cabin by a japanese screen were a small dresser and a mirror . in the dim illumination that came from the distant lamp [female] bent over the open sheet of music on the piano .
there were now other footsteps to be heard along the road , bathsheba 's nerves were still unstrung . she crouched down out of sight again , and the pedestrian came into view . he was a schoolboy , with a bag slung over his shoulder containing his dinner . and a book in his hand , he paused by the gate . and , without looking up , continued murmuring words in tones quite loud enough to reach her ears .
it must , i think , be acknowledged that mr maguire was true to himself . and that he was conducting his case at any rate with courage . lady ball was doubtful what she would do , it was on her tongue to tell the man that her niece 's fortune was gone . but she remembered that she might probably advance her own interests by securing an interview between the two lovers of littlebath in her own presence . she never for a moment doubted that mr maguire 's statement was true .
the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly [male] , although he . in his quality of guardsman , would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers . who were all of high rank ; but our gascon cadet was . as may have been observed , of a provident and almost avaricious character , and with that so vain as almost to rival [male] . to this preoccupation of his vanity , [male] at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish .
ester had no idea what this miserable , restless dreaming of hers was doing for her . she did not see that her very desires after a better life , which were sometimes strong upon her . were colored with impatience and envy , [female] was a [female] . and wrote her some earnest letters ; but to ester it seemed a very easy matter indeed for one who was surrounded . as she imagined [female] to be , by luxury and love .
[female] was crouching on his low stool beside this hand . he needed no softening to touch it now . the chill fingers were in his palm . and his hot tears were falling on them , remembering the crime that he had so nearly committed . he was holding himself in horror , his friend !
no battle -- tarutino , borodino , or austerlitz . takes place as those who planned it anticipated , that is an essential condition . a countless number of free forces ( for nowhere is man freer than during a battle . where it is a question of life and death ) . influence the course taken by the fight .
every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by his own body . i lift my arm and let it fall . my action seems to me free ; but asking myself whether i could raise my arm in every direction . i see that i raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my own body . i chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles .
though a considerable interval of years divided them . the aunt and her niece had a wonderful resemblance to each other . they were both -- the rarest of all forms of beauty , blond italians . that is , with light hair and soft gray eyes , they had a peculiar tint of skin . deeper and mellower than we see in northern lands , and an expression of mingled seriousness and softness that only pertains to the south of [location] .
from the moment of the cardinal 's entrance . gringoire had never ceased to tremble for the safety of his prologue . at first he had enjoined the actors , who had stopped in suspense . to continue , and to raise their voices ; then , perceiving that no one was listening . he had stopped them ; and , during the entire quarter of an hour that the interruption lasted .
it felicitously combined suggestions of chivalry and friendliness . also the man 's profession being of a kind that is flavoured with romance it was possible that [male] bertrand des amis would not ask too many questions . in the end he climbed to the second floor . on the landing he paused outside a door . on which was written `` academy of [male] bertrand des amis . ''
he was something less than a deliberate villain . but he loved her ; he loved her . and until now fate had always given him the thing that he cared for . honest [male] , sleeping the sleep of innocence . seemed to him nothing more than a gigantic stumbling block in his way .
if hetty had known he was there , she would not have cried ; and it would have been better . for then [male] would perhaps have behaved as wisely as he had intended , as it was . she started when he appeared at the end of the side alley . and looked up at him with two great drops rolling down her cheeks . what else could he do but speak to her in a soft , soothing tone .
but now his pity , with his life , was wearing thin , and the dread almost amounting to horror . was rising into being , but before the armour of his pity really broke , he would die . as an insect when its shell is cracked , this was his final resource . others would live on , and know the living death . the ensuing process of hopeless chaos , he would not .
in the little convent there was a centenarian who came from the abbey of fontevrault . she had even been in society before the revolution . she talked a great deal of [female] . keeper of the seals under [female] . and of a presidentess duplat , with whom she had been very intimate .
the rapidity with which this angry scene had passed had filled her with amazement . and the evident resentment of the baronet upon her refusing his assistance . gave her an immediate consciousness that she was herself the real cause of the quarrel . while the manner in which he was preparing to follow mr [male] convinced her of the desperate scene which was likely to succeed . fear , therefore , overcoming every other feeling , forced from her this exclamation before she knew what she said .
i resisted a little , but i must confess i should not have resisted him much if he had not made those promises at all . so after a little struggle , as i said , i lay still and let him come to bed . when he was there he took me in his arms . and so i lay all night with him , but he had no more to do with me . or offered anything to me , other than embracing me .
poor girl , last night 's events had apparently shaken her from that indifference which she seemed to think the best armour of a helpless . proud governess against the world , she would scarcely listen to a word . she was in extreme agitation ; half a dozen times she insisted on leaving . and then sat down again , i had not given her credit for so much wholesome irresolution . so much genuine feeling , her manner almost convinced me of a fact which every one else seemed to hold as certain .
the one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own bed . he felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt . but such ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found , having gone a couple of miles along the mozhaysk road . [male] sat down by the roadside , [male] had fallen . and the roar of guns died away , [male] lay leaning on his elbow for a long time .
so [female] sailed away to find the old world , which is always new and beautiful to young eyes . while her father and friend watched her from the shore . fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the happy hearted girl . who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer [female] dazzling on the sea . dearest people , here i really sit at a front window of the bath hotel , piccadilly .
it was a great shock to meet him in the wood . but i had no time to reflect just then , i only remembered that i had deeply offended him and his people . that they probably looked on me as an enemy . and would think little of taking my life , it was too late to attempt to escape by flight . i was spent with my long journey and the many privations i had suffered .
but be this as it may , be it true or false that sir [male] was most efficacious when in his cups . there can be no doubt that he could not wallow for a week in brandy . six or seven times every year , without in a great measure injuring . and permanently injuring , the outward man , whatever immediate effect such symposiums might have on the inner mind . symposiums indeed they were not ; posiums i will call them .
but mrs. [female] was far too flourishing a person not to speak out her wishes . and have her own way , she had no notion . she said , of coming such a long journey only to see [female] and her husband . and not to have a sight of her former acquaintances at monkshaven . she might have added , that her new bonnet and cloak would be as good as lost if it was not displayed among those who .
and as marjorie turned her pale face back , she saw the face of kindly mr. [male] . suffused and convulsed with fury , very slowly marjorie rose out of the glimmering depths of sleep into which she had fallen on the hot august afternoon . sunk down upon the arm of the great chair that stood by the parlour window . and saw mrs. [female] radiant before her . waving a scrap of paper in her hand .
what did happen at the beginning i must tell as best i can . because i was not there , and can speak for myself only from the temple of [male] . the fat creature at the gate had no french , but the driver of the arabeah addressed him in arabic . and translated his answers , yes , the great lady had come hither with her husband the bey . word should go to her , it should be ascertained whether it was her pleasure to receive these friends who had journeyed from a far country to pay her a visit .
my kindly old landlady , mrs. [female] . was one of my best friends , without telling too broad a falsehood , i could make her believe i had come to spend the night with her . the next day , i hoped , would solve its own problems . `` this is the bridge entrance , ma'am . '' the chauffeur 's voice broke my revery .
but miss woodley reflected upon the inevitable necessity of this measure before she made the proposal . and then made it with a firmness that might have done honour to the inflexibility of dorriforth himself . during the few days that intervened between her open confession of a passion for lord [female] and this proposed plan of separation . the most intricate incoherence appeared in the character of miss milner . and in order to evade a marriage with him .
she felt inclined to add that it was a pity he could not inculcate his own children with some of his apparent courage . for they both seemed far more frightened than interested in the story , and the son 's eyes looked as if they would jump out of his head . perhaps the poor youth was scolded for his timidity afterwards . for when [female] passed their room in going upstairs to get ready to go out . she heard the father speaking in very stern tones .
she wrapped herself closely in her veil . and sat down at a distance from the couch of the wounded knight . with her back turned towards it . fortifying , or endeavouring to fortify her mind , not only against the impending evils from without . but also against those treacherous feelings which assailed her from within , during the interval of quiet which followed the first success of the besiegers .
`` was it appealing ? '' i suggested , `` no , '' she said . `` was it frightened , angry , crushed , resigned ? '' `` no , no ! nothing of these . '' but it had frightened her , she remembered it to this day . she had been ever since fancying she could detect the lingering reflection of that look in all the girl 's glances . in the attentive , in the casual -- even in the grateful glances -- in the expression of the softest moods .
as each day new avenues opened , he began to understand dimly how much it would have meant to him in his relations with his wife . if he had begun long ago under her tuition and learned , at least enough to appreciate the one thing outside society . which she found absorbing , he began to see that if he had listened . and tried , and had induced her to repeat to him parts of the great composers she so loved . on her instruments , when they reached home .
at the end of the breakfast the pussum appeared . in a purple silk wrap with a shimmering sash . she had recovered herself somewhat , but was mute and lifeless still . it was a torment to her when anybody spoke to her . her face was like a small , fine mask , sinister too .
not unrejoiced to see him once again , warm was his welcome to the haunts of men . born of high lineage , linked in high command , he mingled with the magnates of his land . joined the carousals of the great and gay , and saw them smile or sigh their hours away . 100 but still he only saw , and did not share , the common pleasure or the general care . he did not follow what they all pursued with hope still baffled still to be renewed .
beverly could not , in her heart , feel that baldos was doing anything inimical to the country he served . and yet her duty and loyalty to yetive made it imperative that the transaction should be reported at once . a word to quinnox and ravone would be seized and searched for the mysterious paper . this , however , looked utterly unreasonable , for the vagabonds were armed and in force . while yetive was accompanied by but three men who could be depended upon , baldos , under the conditions .
he was wicked , for the look upon his face was not good to see . and he was a coward , for he started at the flutter of a night bird hurrying late to its home in a rock by the wayside . the mist rising from the valley in wreaths of silver gauze startled him again as he rounded the trail to the cabin . and for an instant he stopped and drew his dagger . thinking the ghost he feared was walking thus early , a draught from the bottle he carried in his pocket steadied his nerves .
in a man of bill 's temperament there are so many qualities wounded by a blow such as he had received . that it is hardly surprising that his emotions , when he began to examine them , were mixed . now one , now another , of his wounds presented itself to his notice . and then individual wounds would become difficult to distinguish in the mass of injuries . spiritually , he was in the position of a man who has been hit simultaneously in a number of sensitive spots by a variety of hard and hurtful things .
next morning [male] returned to frankfort in the carriage which mr. [male] had sent for the purpose of bringing his daughters home . for once in her life , [female] was delighted with the idea of visiting her parents . she had learned from a note which her mother had written that the reason of their being sent for was to talk over the matter of going to new orleans . [female] felt differently , she wished , yet dreaded , to go home . she too knew why they were sent for ; and as she was determined not to go to new orleans .
when [female] was out of the louvre , and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles . [male] advised him to order a good repast at the pomme de pin . [male] to engage a lackey , and [male] to provide himself with a suitable [male] . the repast was carried into effect that very day . and the lackey waited at table , the repast had been ordered by [male] .
everything favoured her , the flight was not discovered until nearly three quarters of an hour after clarissa had eloped with her baby down that darksome stair . mrs. [female] , luxuriating in tea . toast , and gossip before the nursery fire . and relieved not a little by the absence of her one year old charge , had been unconscious of the progress of time . it was only when the little clock upon the chimney piece chimed the half hour after six .
[male] learned later that he had never seen a woman cry . not in that way , at least , he was impressed and interested by the mysteriousness of the effect . she was very conscious of being looked at , but was not able to stop herself crying . in fact , she was not capable of any effort . suddenly he advanced two steps , stooped , caught hold of her hands lying on her lap and pulled her up to her feet .
`` i must know more of this , sir , before you leave the house , '' said lady demolines , he saw that between them both there might probably be a very bad quarter of an hour in store for him . but he swore to himself that no union of dragon and tigress should extract from him a word that could be taken as a promise of marriage . the old woman was now kneeling by the head of the sofa . and [female] was standing close by her side , suddenly madalina opened her eyes .
as soon as i was left by myself i had a little nap . i really wanted it , when i awoke again i noticed dear [female] 's letter . if i had had the least idea of what it contained i should certainly not have attempted to open it . being , unfortunately for myself , quite innocent of all suspicion , i read the letter . it immediately upset me for the day .
the music on christmas mornings was frequently below the standard of church performances at other times . the boys were sleepy from the heavy exertions of the night . the men were slightly wearied ; and now , in addition to these constant reasons . there was a dampness in the atmosphere that still further aggravated the evil . their strings , from the recent long exposure to the night air .
just as he reached this point , it was quite wonderful how strict an attention every monk paid to his words . they leaned forward , forgetting their dinner , and listened with all their might , one of them . who had evidently received an education , took notes underneath the table . thus it was that [female] escaped observation when she left the refectory . as she came up stairs into the hall where geoffrey was caged .
it was really before his god that [male] was about to attempt such restitution as seemed possible . a great dread had seized his susceptible frame , and the scorching approach of shame wrought in him a new spiritual need . night and day , while the resurgent threatening past was making a conscience within him . he was thinking by what means he could recover [male] and trust . by what sacrifice he could stay the [male] his belief in these moments of dread was .
she took the vial from her pocket . a hand was on the lock of the door ! she turned and fled through the dressing room and study . waking mewks as she passed , he , hurrying into the chamber . saw [male] already entered , when sepia learned who it was that had scared her .
in what a labyrinth of lies had the first fatal suppression of the truth involved [male] all ! one deception after another had been forced on us ; one disaster after another had followed retributively as the result . and , now that i was left to deal single handed with the hard necessities of our position . no choice seemed left to me but to go on deceiving lucilla still ! i was weary of it and ashamed of it .
[female] allowed nothing to be divined , without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it . and that it must be concealed , there was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had recently come to [female] . and the habit of new clothes developed by that stranger which was very repugnant to [organization] . it might be accidental , no doubt , certainly , but it was a menacing accident . he never opened his mouth to [male] about this stranger .
thus he saw what the priest was looking at , the ladder was erected near the permanent gallows . there were some people and many soldiers in the place . a man was dragging a white thing , from which hung something [male] . along the pavement , this man halted at the foot of the gallows . here something took place which quasimodo could not see very clearly .
i bet if a fello had both legs shot off theyd prop you up against the wall an put you peelin onions . i got to quit now , they got a thing called retreat they have every night . i always like to be there just to show the captin im behind him regardless . everyone round here is goin to school now so they can be speshulists . not the kind your mother goes to , mable , a speshulist only does one thing .
mrs maple would have been inconsolable at a defence against which she had nothing positive to object . had she not reaped some comfort from finding that even harleigh opposed including the stranger in the acting circle . the delay of the performance , and an application to miss sycamore . seemed now settled , when mrs [female] , the housekeeper . who was also aiding in the room , lamented the trouble to be renewed for the supper preparations .
there he found the helpless , blood covered ogbot . bound hand and foot and almost dead from loss of blood . the clothes of the [male] were on the floor . while his own were missing , gone with the prisoner , ogbot , as soon as he was able . related his experience of the night before , it was while making his rounds at midnight that he heard moans from the cell .
the goldsmith , who was no great clerk , remained silent and pensive , hereupon came tiennette . clad in glorious apparel , wearing a robe of white wool . with her hair tastefully dressed , and , withal , so royally beautiful , that the goldsmith was petrified with ecstasy . and the chamberlain confessed that he had never seen so perfect a creature . then , thinking that there was too great danger to the goldsmith in this spectacle .
she took it off [female] . and , partly from the consciousness of beauty , partly from bashfulness . she blushed so intensely , that cheek , brow , neck . and bosom , were suffused with crimson , [female] blushed also . but it was a momentary feeling ; and , mastered by higher emotions .
then sir [male] rode after [male] his brother by the trace of their horses . he sought a great while ; and at the last he overtook a man clothed in religious clothing . that told him [male] was dead , and showed him a slain body . lying in a thicket , that well seemed to him the body of [male] . then he made such a sorrow that he fell to the earth all in a swoon .
the morning after little [male] had left , the old prince donned his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief . his caleche was already at the door , princess [female] saw him walk out of the house in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his armed peasants and domestic [female] . she sat by the window listening to his voice which reached her from the garden . suddenly several men came running up the avenue with frightened faces , princess [female] ran out to the porch . down the flower bordered path , and into the avenue , a large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving toward her .
philip drew himself head and shoulders over his log as he watched . he forgot himself in this moment when he was looking upon men running into the face of death . in another moment came the crash of rifles muffled behind log walls . he could hear the whine of bullets . the zip , zip , zip of them back in the spruce and cedar .
it took marguerite some time to collect her scattered senses . the whole of this last short episode had taken place in less than a minute . and desgas and the soldiers were still about two hundred yards away from the `` chat gris . '' when she realised what had happened , a curious mixture of joy and wonder filled her heart . it all was so neat , so ingenious , [organization] was still absolutely helpless , far more so than he could even have been under a blow from the fist .
for it seems to him that he needs it now . and all the ladies , who are devoted to the damsel , beseech god repeatedly and pray to him earnestly not to allow the death or the defeat of him who has entered the fray on her account . the ladies , having no other weapons , thus assist him with their prayers . and the lion brings him such effective aid . that at his first attack , he strikes so fiercely the seneschal .
every autumn the company found itself suddenly in easy circumstances . at any moment that thorpe had chosen to be content with the progress made . he could have , so to speak , declared dividends with his partner . instead of undertaking more improvements , for part of which he borrowed some money . he could have divided the profits of the season 's cut .
peter was glad when the camp roused itself out of sleep with waking voices . and laughter , and the building of fires . he waited eagerly for sun cloud , at last she came out of yellow bird 's tepee . rubbing her eyes in the face of the glow in the east . and then her white teeth flashed a smile of welcome at him .
it will be best , perhaps , to say nothing further about it , well . good night , my boy , if you must go . then fletcher went off to the house , wondering as he went at the change which had apparently come over the character of his old friend . mr. [male] had always been a strong man , and now he seemed to be as weak as water . as to everett , fletcher was sure that there was something wrong , but he could not see his way to interfere himself .
mrs. [female] glanced at armitage sharply . she had dined at his ranch house in [location] and knew that he lived like a gentleman . that his house , its appointments and service were unusual for a western ranchman . and she recalled , too , that she and her husband had often speculated as to armitage 's antecedents and history . without arriving at any conclusion in regard to him .
`` well , lad ? '' he said at last , briefly putting the great question . [male] walked to the window and seemed to lose himself for a moment in the contemplation of the quiet night . there were no more than a few stragglers in the street now ; the moon shone white and clear on the empty square . `` i should like to walk up and down outside and think it over , '' he said . turning to us ; and , as bernenstein sprang up to accompany him .
a forsyte is instinctively aware that facts are the real crux of any situation . she might conquer jon 's prejudice . but without exact machinery to complete their desperate resolve , nothing would happen . from the invaluable tome she learned that they must each be twenty one . or some one 's consent would be necessary , which of course was unobtainable ; then she became lost in directions concerning licenses .
the aunt and the niece were to dine with them alone . intimately and easily -- as easily as should be consistent with the question of their afterwards going on together to some absurdly belated party . at which they had had it from aunt maud that they would do well to show . sir [male] was to make his appearance on the morrow of this . and in respect to that complication milly had already her plan .
dr thorne said nothing of the matter to his niece . and she , therefore , would have been absolutely bewildered by [female] 's absence . had she not received some tidings of what had taken place at greshamsbury through patience oriel . [female] and patience discussed the matter fully . and it was agreed between them that it would be better that [female] should know what sterner orders respecting her had gone forth from the tyrant at greshamsbury .
peppino , who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories . struck a light and lit a torch , two other men descended after danglars forming the rearguard . and pushing danglars whenever he happened to stop , they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors . the walls were hollowed out in sepulchres , one above the other , and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes . like those which we see on the faces of the dead , a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand .
his industry was exemplary , he wished to catch the earliest possible train next morning . it seems that for seven and twenty years he had never missed being seated on his office stool at the factory punctually at ten o'clock every day . he listened to mrs. [female] 's objections with undisguised impatience . why could not [female] get up and have her breakfast at eight like other people ? in his house the breakfast was at eight sharp , mrs. [male] 's polite stoicism overcame him at last .
`` it 's horrible , '' said [female] to herself , there was a change in her . but she was still inarticulate , somewhere in her mind , but not formulated , was the feeling that she was too comfortable . her [female] was a cheap [female] , bought at no price . her last waking determination was to finish the afghan quickly and to knit for the men at the war . [male] was ill the next morning , [male] went for the doctor .
when the sun shone , as it did with unusual brightness that christmas week . it revealed much that was faded and not altogether well kept up in stogdon house and its grounds . in truth , sir [male] had retired from service under the government of [location] with a pension that was not adequate . in his opinion , to his services , as it certainly was not adequate to his ambitions . his career had not come up to his expectations , and although he was a very fine .
sir owen feinted , and then , quickly recovering , he smote the other so hard and stern a blow that the blade bit through headpiece . skin and bone , until it wounded the brain itself . in a little while a great castle , resplendent with new stone . shone before them , the wounded knight thundered across the drawbridge . with owen close behind him ; but when the blue knight gained the street beyond .
little questions of expediency he solved . dilemmas he discussed leisurely with [male] shearer . occasionally he lent a shoulder when the peaveys lacked of prying a stubborn log from its bed . not once did he glance at the nooning sun . his patience was quiet and sure , when evening came he smoked placidly outside the office .
observing that he made no sketch , however , and that he talked about business only . she began to have suspicions that he represented some creditor of her father 's . the balance due to whom was noted in that pocket volume . regarded from this point of view mr [male] 's puffings expressed injury and impatience . and each of his louder snorts became a demand for payment .
levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming . and only put the question in deference to him . and so he only told him about the sale of his wheat and money matters . levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married . and to ask his advice ; he had indeed firmly resolved to do so , but after seeing his brother .
suddenly came a torrent sound in the air , heard of few and heeded by none . and straight into the hall rushed upon the gay company a deluge of rain . mingled with large , half melted hail stones , in a moment or two scarce a light was left burning . except those in the holes and recesses of the walls . the merrymakers scattered like flies -- into the house .
in other places people operated on a patient 's mind . without saying a word to him , and cured him . in others , experts assembled patients in a room and prayed over them . and appealed to their faith , and those patients went away cured , wherever you find a king who can not cure the king's evil you can be sure that the most valuable superstition that supports his throne . the subject 's belief in the divine appointment of his sovereign .
if not , it would be necessary to wait till daylight . to wait the whole night long ; a delay which might prove ruinous , if by chance some ship 's lantern should be in sight . [male] would be able to signal it from the height of the great douvre . the weather was calm , there was no wind or rolling sea . there was a possibility of the figure of a man being observed moving against the background of the starry sky .
all those trying hours whilst i was frozen and yet was in a living fire . as you may say , on account of that swarm of crawlers . that same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my tired head . how do people stand this miserable armor ? how have they managed to stand it all these generations ? how can they sleep at night for dreading the tortures of next day ?
his position , of course , was delicate , he could not got to maud and beg her to confide in him . maud would not understand his motives , and might leap to the not unjustifiable conclusion that he had been at the sherry , no ! men were easier to handle than women , as soon as his duties would permit . and in the present crowded condition of the house they were arduous . he set out for [male] 's cottage .
she wished to prove to him that she did desire his comfort . and sought to regain his favour ; and he had given her another strong motive for exertion . in keeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her aunts . not to excite suspicion by her look or manner was now an object worth attaining . and she felt equal to almost anything that might save her from her aunt norris .
incessantly engaged , either in monotonous embroidery work or in rolling up endless cigarettes for the count 's own particular smoking . on the few occasions when her cold blue eyes are off her work . they are generally turned on her husband , with the look of mute submissive inquiry which we are all familiar with in the eyes of a faithful dog . the only approach to an inward thaw which i have yet detected under her outer covering of icy constraint . has betrayed itself , once or twice , in the form of a suppressed tigerish jealousy of any woman in the house to whom the count speaks .
if the reader will visit the opera one morning and ask leave to stroll where he pleases . without being accompanied by a stupid guide , let him go to box five and knock with his fist or stick on the enormous column that separates this from the stage box . he will find that the column sounds hollow , after that , do not be astonished by the suggestion that it was occupied by the voice of the ghost . there is room inside the column for two men . if you are surprised that , when the various incidents occurred , no one turned round to look at the column .
but it was a bored garden i stepped into just as the last purple flush of day was being drunk down by the night . the tall white lilies laid their heads over on my breast and went to sleep before i had said a word to them . and the nasturtiums snarled round my feet until they got my slippers stained with green . only [male] 's bachelor's buttons stood up stiff and sturdy , slightly flushed with imbibing the night dew . i felt cheered at the sight of them .
and she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood . i looked up and saw , far off in the shade of a tree . half a dozen armed [organization] and their squires . and straightway there was bustle among them and tightening of saddle girths for the mount . my pipe was ready and would have been lit , if i had not been lost in thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliging anybody .
paulina , good queen , my lord . good queen : i say , good queen . and would by combat make her good , so were i a man , the worst about you , [male] . let him that makes but trifles of his eyes first hand me . on mine own accord i will off .
higgins , take her away , do you suppose i am going to keep your daughter for you , [female] . you must have , how else could you possibly know that she is here , doolittle . have i asked you for a brass farthing ? i leave it to the gentleman here . have i said a word about money ? [male] . pickering .
and then , with his nose coming down over his moustache and his moustache going up and under his nose . repaired to his allotted cell , it is indispensable to present the accomplished lady who was of sufficient importance in the suite of the [female] family to have a line to herself in the travellers ', book . mrs general was the daughter of a clerical dignitary in a cathedral town . where she had led the fashion until she was as near forty five as a single lady can be . a stiff commissariat officer of sixty , famous as a martinet .
`` he will henceforward be a winged serpent , '' grumbled the musketeer , with a remnant of hatred against his recent adversary . but [male] , approaching him , offered to his eyes a physiognomy so different from that which he had been accustomed to see him wear . he appeared so good , so mild , so easy ; his eyes took the expression of an intelligence so noble . that [male] , a connoisseur in physiognomies . was moved , and almost changed in his convictions , [male] pressed his hand .
it proceeded with some cheerfulness , a friendly neighbour or two assisting , when the large articles of furniture had been packed in position . a circular nest was made of the beds and bedding . in which joan durbeyfield and the young children were to sit through the journey . after loading there was a long delay before the horses were brought , these having been unharnessed during the ridding . but at length , about two o'clock , the whole was under way .
on the thursday , friday , monday , and tuesday following . the great debate on mr. [male] 's bill was continued . and at three on the tuesday night the house divided . there was a majority in favour of the ministers . not large enough to permit them to claim a triumph for their party .
`` i have a card somewhere as will tell me , '' she answered , and the man , partly relieved , jumped into the boat . which was now pushing off to make way for the arrivals from some steamer . [female] felt in her pocket for the card . on which was written the name of the street where she was to have met mr. [male] at two o'clock .
the king then addressed himself to settle the articles of combat . which cost a considerable time , as it was necessary on some points to consult with the opposite parties . as well as with the soldan , they were at length finally agreed upon . and adjusted by a protocol in french and in arabian , which was subscribed by saladin as umpire of the field . and by [male] and [male] as guarantees for the two combatants .
she led him off to the phaeton triumphantly . while [male] was fain to find some vent for his admiration of his gifted wife 's diplomacy in sundry winks and grins to the address of no one in particular . as he bustled to and fro between the terrace and the hall . arranging the mode and manner of the day 's excursion . who was to be driven by whom , and so on , [female] found herself bestowed in a landau full of ladies .
this noise redoubled when [female] , with a company of musketeers . placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church . he had instructed [male] to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony . and [male] , in full dress , mounted his finest horse . taking the part of supernumerary musketeer , as [male] had so often done formerly .
had a concert , bazaar , lecture , or dorcas meeting required the patronage and support of lady constantine at this juncture . the circumstance would probably have been sufficient to divert her mind from swithincleeve and astronomy for some little time . but as none of these incidents were within the range of expectation . welland house and parish lying far from large towns and watering places . the void in her outer life continued .
bill should not have danced , he was an estimable young man . honest , amiable , with high ideals , he had played an excellent game of football at the university . his golf handicap was plus two ; and he was no mean performer with the gloves . but we all of [male] have our limitations . and bill had his , he was not a good dancer .
they got their supper and a nap . and about midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed the required conditions . we took possession of the well and its surroundings . my boys were experts in all sorts of things . from the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical instrument .
he took his pack to the sledge and dogs in the edge of the spruce . and kazan leaped to greet him at the end of his babiche . this night as jan traveled through the forest he did not notice the stars or the friendly shadows . `` a year , '' he repeated to himself . again and again , and once , when kazan rubbed against his leg and looked up into his face .
he strained her to his breast . and smothered her face and the child 's with kisses . and washed them with the rain of his tears , i suspected , i inquired . yes , i was right ; it was husband and wife . they had to be torn apart by force ; the girl had to be dragged away .
[female] , the second son , had been placed in his father 's office . and he also had died before the time at which our story is supposed to commence . he had been a poor sickly creature , always ailing , gifted with an affectionate nature . and a great respect for the blood of the mackenzies . but not gifted with much else that was intrinsically his own , the blood of the mackenzies was .
that was because offensive eyes had made her forget the almost immediate future in the quite immediate present . but the hotel , with light hearted taxis tearing up to it . brought remembrance with a shock , she envied everyone else who was bound for the savoy . even old women , and fat gentlemen with large noses . they were going there because they wanted to go , for their pleasure .
after the noon meal he lay on his blanket under the hemlock shelter . smoking and lazily watching injin [male] busy at the side of the trail . the indian had terminated a long two days search by toting from the forest a number of strips of the outer bark of white birch . in its green state pliable as cotton . thick as leather , and light as air .
captain , yes , you have dropped them like henbane in my ears . and circumstances have strengthened them , free me from the uncertainty . tell me outright that it is true and i will forgive you beforehand , captain . what does it matter when you know that i shall not divulge it ? do you think a man would go and spread his own shame broadcast , [male] .
the king 's palace and gardens stretch along one end of the public park . and are but just across the street from the hotel where the hohenwalds and the americans were staying . as the hotel was the first building on the left of the square . [organization] could see from his windows the illuminations , and the guards of honor . and the carriages arriving and departing , and the citizens of [male] crowding the parks and peering through the iron rails into the king 's garden .
he was getting in love with hetty . that was quite plain , he was ready to pitch everything else -- no matter where . for the sake of surrendering himself to this delicious feeling which had just disclosed itself . it was no use blinking the fact now . they would get too fond of each other , if he went on taking notice of her .
among the rest , she often told me how the greatest part of the inhabitants of the colony came thither in very indifferent circumstances from england . that , generally speaking , they were of two sorts ; either , first , such as were brought over by masters of ships to be sold as servants . `` such as we call them , my dear , '' says she , `` but they are more properly called slaves . '' or , secondly , such as are transported from newgate and other prisons , after having been found guilty of felony and other crimes punishable with death .
they paddled without a rest until twelve . after lunch [female] confiscated [female] 's paddle and made her sit facing him in the canoe . the afternoon passed like a dream to [male] . he did not refer again to fort o god or the people there . he did not speak again of eileen brokaw , of lord fitzhugh .
cards and supper were over , but the visitors had not yet dispersed , [male] threw off his cloak and entered the first room . in which were the remains of supper , a footman . thinking no one saw him , was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses . from the third room came sounds of laughter . the shouting of familiar voices , the growling of a bear .
at night , when the carriers passed under her windows in their carts singing the `` marjolaine , '' she awoke , and listened to the noise of the iron bound wheels . which , as they gained the country road . was soon deadened by the soil , `` they will be there tomorrow ! '' she said to herself , she bought a plan of [location] .
the heart of this young fellow of eighteen . still almost a child , was full of a dull despair , above his head . above the shadows of these long vaulted ways , of this rat run through which the monster of metal whirled . all swarming with human masks -- was [location] , the snow . the cold january darkness , the nightmare of life and of death , the war .
[male] had broken a small blood vessel , and the doctor said he would have to be very careful for a long time . it was likely to prove a long case , but [male] had severed the jugular at one swift . keen stroke , and had died almost instantly , of course there was an inquest . and the coroner asked many questions regarding the habits of the deceased . mrs. [female] was one of the witnesses called .
the rose vine covering the porch roof was filled with pink blossoms . hundreds of them swinging out over his head . the air was sweet with the odor of honeysuckle . the old locust tree would soon be alive with bees . for it was already budded , he took the baby in his arms and saw that its cheeks were growing round and plump .
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart . and , by a manoeuvre of mrs. [female] . had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone . which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . mrs. [female] and her sister scarcely opened their mouths .
the objects which durand held caused claiborne to stare , and then he laughed again . durand had caught up from a hook in armitage 's room a [male] cloak . so long that it trailed at length from his arms . its red lining glowing brightly where it lay against the outer [male] . from the folds of the cloak a sword .
he would not have bitten me , and i , faithless cannibal ! had murdered him , that cursed fancy would live on , worming itself into every crevice of my mind . the severed head would grow and grow in the night time to something monstrous at last . the hellish white lidless eyes increasing to the size of two full moons , `` murderer , murderer ! '' they would say ; first a murderer of your own fellow creatures .
i could hear his stick beating hurriedly on the stone . i was indignant at my grandfather 's conduct . he had deliberately run off , leaving me alone with a young woman whom i particularly wished to avoid . it was just such a polite murmur as one might employ in speaking to an old foe at a friend 's table . she listened a moment for his step .
`` the stage of love '' was composed by the poet kullianmull . for the amusement of ladkhan , the son of [male] lodi . the same ladkhan being in some places spoken of as ladana mull . and in others as ladanaballa , he is supposed to have been a relation or connection of the house of lodi . which reigned in [location] from [location] 1450 1526 , the work would .
said the horrible man , turning his chin round over his white cravat . `` they always tell me at your lodgings that you ai not at home . '' by this time a policeman was explaining to mr. [male] with gentle violence that he must not stand there . that he must go aside into one of the corners , `` i know all that , '' said mr. [male] , retreating , of course i do .
the splendid red and yellow patch quilt now made its appearance . and [female] would not be satisfied unless [female] praised it all over . border , centre , and ground work . right side and wrong ; and [female] did her duty . saying all the more , because she could not work herself up to any very hearty admiration of her rival 's present .
he looked through the orlegna gorge , and caught the silvery sheen of the [male] snow capped summit . hardly a rock was visible , the gale had clothed each crag with a white shroud . all day long the upper reaches of the glacier would be pelted by avalanches . it struck him that an early stroll to the highest point of the path beyond cavloccio might be rewarded with a distant view of several falls . in any case , it provided an excellent pretext for securing [male] 's company .
she took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room . after receiving her visitors , the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more . but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came `` to congratulate . '' the countess wished to have a tete a tete talk with the friend of her childhood . princess [female] , whom she had not seen properly since she returned from petersburg .
he took so great a force upon an expedition for which a quarter of the men would have sufficed so as to ensure by overwhelming numbers the avoidance of all unnecessary violence . absolutely unobserved he led them up the slope towards arwenack through the darkness that had now closed in . to tread his native soil once more went near to drawing tears from him . how familiar was the path he followed with such confidence in the night . how well known each [male] and stone by which he went with his silent multitude hard upon his heels .
the poupee of the durande was particularly dear to [male] . he had instructed the carver to make it resemble deruchette . it looked like a rude attempt to cut out a face with a hatchet . or like a clumsy log trying hard to look like a girl , this unshapely block produced a great effect upon [male] 's imagination . he looked upon it with an almost superstitious admiration .
he grew cold and still , waiting in the silence , his hands clutched her clothing . but he did not lift his head , he had shed blood and had lost her . they might take him and hang him . at last he told her so , brokenly , and she knew not what to do . gently she placed her hand on his head and drew the thick silken hair through her fingers .
the inner areas of the first and second fingers of his left hand bore cigarette stains . seemingly indelible : the first and second fingers of his right hand were strongly ornamented in a like manner . tokens proving him ambidextrous to but a limited extent , however . moreover , his garments and garnitures were not comparable to those of either newland sanders or that dapper antique , mr. [male] . noble 's straw hat might have brightened under the treatment of lemon juice or other restorative .
`` i am going over at once to find out , '' she declared resolutely but still staring across the street . her intention was arrested by the sight of that awful , sombrely glistening door . swinging back suddenly on the yawning darkness of the hall , out of which literally flew out . right out on the pavement , almost without touching the white steps , a little figure swathed in a [female] pinafore up to the chin . its hair streaming back from its head , darting past a lamp post .
then i told him what measures i would take to raise such a sum of # 300 or thereabouts ; and i argued with him how good a method it would be to put an end to our misfortunes and restore our circumstances in the world . to what we had both expected ; and i added , that after seven years . if we lived , we might be in a posture to leave our plantations in good hands . and come over again and receive the income of it , and live here and enjoy it .
some of the households were lively , some mournful ; some were stopping at the doors of wayside inns . where , in due time , the durbeyfield menagerie also drew up to bait horses and refresh the travellers . during the halt tess 's eyes fell upon a three pint blue mug . which was ascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine section of a household . sitting on the summit of a load that had also drawn up at a little distance from the same inn .
she was even allowed to read novels now , but only such novels as were especially recommended to [location] . who was one of the patronesses of a book club at [organization] . novels in which young ladies fell in love with curates . and did not marry them : novels in which everybody suffered all manner of misery . and rather liked it : novels in which , if the heroine did marry the man she loved .
he did not say `` sorry to hear , '' i wondered did the omission strike her ? but no -- she evidently regarded [female] both as mere acquaintances . inevitably , perhaps even tenderly , bound up with this time ; and as such . claiming a more than ordinary place in her regard and remembrance . no man with common sense or common feeling could for a moment dare to misinterpret the emotion she showed .
that evening i went to [male] vandenhuten 's ; but i had bent the bow and adjusted the shaft in vain . the string broke , i rang the bell at the great door ( it was a large . handsome house in an expensive part of the town ) , . a manservant opened ; i asked for [male] vandenhuten . [male] vandenhuten and family were all out of town .
questioning himself as he lay awake in the oran hotel . with windows open to the moonlight , [male] was forced to admit that the picture was blurred because victoria had gone out of it . her figure had been in the foreground when first he had seen the moving panorama . and all the rest had been only a magical frame for her , the charm of her radiant youth . and the romance of the errand which had brought her knocking .
i spent three busy days at the brennan place . there was much to be done both inside and outside the house , after the first day . [female] did not return with me , as my mother in law needed her in the apartment . but i engaged another woman with the one i had for the work in the house and put the grinning [male] in charge of an old man i had secured to clean up the grounds and make the garden . i soon found that i had a treasure in mr. [male] .
in fact , a case of [female] shagreen . resembling a medallion portrait , was suspended from the ribbon . the old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening it . with that air of enjoyment , rapture , and wrath . with which a poor hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him .
the attack of the right wing of the french on papelotte was calculated . in fact , to overthrow the english left , to cut off the road to [location] . to bar the passage against possible prussians , to force mont saint jean , to turn [location] back on hougomont . thence on braine l'alleud , thence on hal , nothing easier . with the exception of a few incidents this attack succeeded papelotte was taken .
to mr [male] 's museum mr [male] repaired when at length the mounds were down and gone . it being evening , he found that gentleman . as he expected , seated over his fire ; but did not find him . as he expected , floating his powerful mind in tea . `` why , you smell rather comfortable here , '' said [male] , seeming to take it ill .
[female] 's keen glance told him that brokaw himself had not slept much . the promoter 's eyes were heavy , with little puffy bags under them . but otherwise he betrayed no signs of unrest or lack of rest . he motioned [male] to a chair close to a huge fireplace in which a pile of birch was leaping into flame . offered him a cigar , and plunged immediately into business .
when in [location] he went to carlton terrace and spent the night in absolute solitude . it had been his plan to join [male] for some partridge shooting at matching . and then to go yachting till such time as he should be enabled to renew his suit to miss [female] . early in november he would again ask her to be his wife . these had been his plans , but now it seemed that everything was changed .
this , however , is mere speculation ; who the person was , who , for the satisfaction of [female] aunt 's mind . ought to have been brought forward and never was brought forward , will never be positively known . the autumn days went on , and little [male] never came to the marshalsea now and went away without seeing him . no , no , no , one morning , as [male] listened for the light feet that every morning ascended winged to his heart . bringing the heavenly brightness of a new love into the room where the old love had wrought so hard and been so true .
when his grandfather had left the house , [male] , who was restless . unhappy , and full of vague surmises , sat for some time with his head in his hands . and at last only roused himself with an effort , it was growing dusk already . for autumn had given place to winter . and the days were short , there was still light enough , however , for him to see to write a letter .
he came to his senses -- that is to say , he opened his eyes and looked vacantly about him . between four and five hours after the time when we had found him on the floor of the workshop . his mind , poor fellow , was still all astray . he recognized nobody , he imitated the action of writing with his finger . and said very earnestly , over and over again , `` go home , jicks ; go home , go home ! ''
then lynette reminded him of all his victories . and of how even the [male] knight had yielded to him . but what encouraged gareth more than all lynette said was that , when he looked up to the castle . he saw a beautiful lady at one of the windows . she smiled and waved her hands to him .
it was not things themselves . but the reflection of things in the art of others . that moved him to produce , [male] , i think , says of dryden . that he took fire with the running of his own wheels . so did [male] ; but it was the running of the wheels of others that set his wheels running .
edith began to sob so bitterly , and to declare so vehemently that [female] had lost all love for her . and no longer looked upon her as a friend , that [female] came to think that she had expressed too harsh an opinion for the relief of her own wounded pride . and ended by being [female] 's slave for the rest of the day . while that little lady , overcome by wounded feeling , lay like a victim on the sofa . heaving occasionally a profound sigh , till at last she fell asleep .
all this [female] knew in her subconsciousness . not in her mind , she knew her next step she knew what she should move on to . when she left [female] , she was afraid of [male] . that he might kill her , but she did not intend to be killed , a fine thread still united her to him . it should not be her death which broke it .
one afternoon , late in the month of february , i came ashore at the wharf at dusk . i had pulled down as far as greenwich with the ebb tide . and had turned with the tide , it had been a fine bright day . but had become foggy as the sun dropped , and i had had to feel my way back among the shipping , pretty carefully . both in going and returning , i had seen the signal in his window , all well .
it was on a day of the spring before last . we street sweepers work in brigades of three . and we were with union 5 3992 , they of the half brain . and with international 4 8818 , now union 5 3992 are a sickly lad and sometimes they are stricken with convulsions . when their mouth froths and their eyes turn white .
fourthly , it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the emperor , kings , and dukes . whose capture would have been in the highest degree embarrassing for the russians . as the most adroit diplomatists of the time recognized , still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of the french . when our own army had melted away to half before reaching [male] and a whole division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners . and when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger .
the circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly favorable for an attempt at escape . was that the roofers were re laying and re jointing , at that very moment , a portion of the slates on the prison . the saint bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated from the charlemagne and the [male] courts . up above there were scaffoldings and ladders ; in other words . bridges and stairs in the direction of liberty .
the next two days passed in much the same way , on the evening of the 4th of september . [male] asked his daughter for the key of his study . [female] trembled at this request , which seemed to her of bad omen . why did her father ask for this key which she always kept . and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment ? the young girl looked at [female] .
[female] , silent also , watched the giant blocks of vapour grouping themselves overhead forming the shapeless mass of clouds . upon the horizon brooded and lengthened out a band of mist of [female] . in the zenith , another band of lead colour . pale , ragged fragments of cloud hung from the great mass above upon the mist below . the pile of cloud which formed the background was wan .
three years later jerome tried his luck again , with precisely the same result . and after that he had asked [male] once a year to marry him . and just as regularly [male] said no a little more brusquely and a little more decidedly every year . now , in the mellowness of a fifteen year old courtship , jerome did not mind it at all . he knew that everything comes to the man who has patience to wait .
he crossed his knees in a discomfited silence . by all his codes it was impossible to ask a woman with whom he had just broken off his engagement to help him to become acquainted with another woman with a view to his falling in love with her . if it was announced that their engagement was over , a long and complete separation would inevitably follow . in those circumstances , letters and gifts were returned . after years of distance the severed couple met .
and he raised his hat with sincere reverence . we too had heard -- at least [male] had -- of this wonderful man . i saw the [male] of mr. [male] 's society was strongly upon him . it was no wonder , more brilliant , more versatile talent i never saw . he turned `` from grave to gay , from lively to severe '' -- appearing in all phases like the gentleman .
if i were to plead anything in mitigation of the preposterous fancy that a bad design will sometimes claim to be a good and an expressly religious design . it would be the curious coincidence that it has been brought to its climax in these pages . in the days of the public examination of late directors of a [organization] . but , i submit myself to suffer judgment to go by default on all these counts . if need be , and to accept the assurance that nothing like them was ever known in this land .
the music of the organ ceased , and [female] heard the closing of the instrument . the first person who appeared upon the steep stone steps was a boy in corduroy trousers and a dark linen smock frock . who shambled down the stairs with a good deal of unnecessary clatter of his hobnailed shoes . and who was red in the face from the exertion of blowing the bellows of the old organ . close behind this boy came a young lady , very plainly dressed in a [male] silk gown and a large gray shawl .
as the ship came in sight of portsmouth harbour . the signal flags ran up the ropes . the beloved union [male] floated triumphantly over all , return signals were made from the harbour . on board all became bustle and preparation for landing . while on shore there was the evident movement of expectation .
it was certainly ludicrous , and when stoddard faced me again he was biting his lip . pickering was studying the cartridge boxes on the library table . the [male] , too , was viewing these effects with interest not . i think , unmixed with awe , `` mr , [male] , will you serve your writ ? '' he said , and i looked to stoddard for any hint from him as to what i should do .
once before bimala had offered up her ornaments , i am not usually in the habit of drawing lines . but i felt i had to draw the line there , i know why i feel this hesitation . it is for man to give ornaments to woman . to take them from her wounds his manliness . but i must forget myself , am i taking them ? they are for the divine mother .
then here , on this mountaintop , with the world below me and nothing above me but the sun . i shall live my own truth , gaea is pregnant with my child . he will be taught to say `` i '' and to bear the pride of it . he will be taught to walk straight on his own feet , he will be taught reverence for his own spirit . when i shall have read all the books and learned my new way , when my home will be ready and my earth tilled .
then when sir mordred wist and understood how he was beguiled . he was passing wroth out of measure , and , a short tale for to make . he went and laid a mighty siege about the tower of [location] . and made many great assaults thereat , and threw many great engines unto them . and shot great guns , but all might not prevail sir mordred , because queen guenever .
then , when he wedded king howell 's daughter of brittany and had other children . the stepmother was wroth that [female] should be heir to the country of lyonesse rather than her own son . wherefore this jealous queen resolved to become rid of her stepson , and she put poison into a silver cup in the chamber where [female] and her children were together . intending that when [male] was thirsty he should drink it . but it happened that the queen 's own son espied the cup with poison .
some readers of this history will doubtless regard it as incredible that people should construct matrimonial prospects on the mere report that a bachelor of good fortune and possibilities was coming within reach . and will reject the statement as a mere outflow of gall . they will aver that neither they nor their first cousins have minds so unbridled . and that in fact this is not human nature , which would know that such speculations might turn out to be fallacious . and would therefore not entertain them , but , let it be observed , nothing is here narrated of human nature generally .
`` jan will be here very soon , melisse , '' he said . running his fingers gently through her hair , it fell out upon the pillow in thick brown waves . and the sight of it choked him with the memory of another vision which would remain with him until the end of time . it was her mother 's hair . shining softly in the dim light ; her mother 's eyes looked up at him as he sat beside her through all this long day .
on being unlocked the hut was found precisely as swithin had left it two days before . [male] was thoroughly wearied , and sat down , while he gathered a handful of twigs and spikelets from the masses strewn without and lit a small fire . first taking the precaution to blind the little window and relock the door . [male] looked curiously around by the light of the blaze . the hut was small as the prophet 's chamber provided by the shunammite .
david provided her with books . as he had promised himself , sometimes he brought them down to her . and they read together ; sometimes he left them with her and she read them by herself eagerly and happily . but so busy was she that she found very little time to be with him . not only did all the work of the household fall on her .
it happened that [male] was not coming to the breakfast table ; he had some exercises to write for that morning 's class . and had requested his mother to send a cup of tea into the study . [female] volunteered to carry it : she must be busy about something . look after somebody , the cup was entrusted to her ; for , if restless . she was also careful , as the study was opposite the breakfast room .
for [male] was reserved more searching torment , he could not realise at first that maisie . whom he had ordered to go had left him without a word of farewell . he was savagely angry against torpenhow , who had brought upon him this humiliation and troubled his miserable [male] . then his dark hour came and he was alone with himself and his desires to get what help he could from the darkness . the queen could do no wrong , but in following the right , so far as it served her work .
it was , to be concluded that this young surgeon physician 's first visit to the rue fossette would be the last . the respectable [male] being expected home the next day . there appeared no reason why his temporary substitute should again represent him . but the fates had written their decree to the contrary , [male] had been summoned to see a rich old hypochondriac at the antique university town of bouquin moisi . and upon his prescribing change of air and travel as remedies .
he paid , vexed that his passage should have aroused remark . every flight should be an imperceptible slipping away , a heavy cart was crossing the seine at the same time as himself . and on its way , like him , to the right bank . this was of use to him , he could traverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart . towards the middle of the bridge , cosette , whose feet were benumbed .
i paused to allow the two figures to widen the distance between [female] as they traversed the path that curved away toward the chapel . i could still hear their voices , and see the lantern flash and disappear . i felt an impulse to turn back , or plunge into the woodland . but i was carried on uncontrollably , the light glimmered , and her voice still floated back to me . it stole through the keen winter dark like a memory of spring .
throughout [location] had run the fame of this beauty . in the bazaar of [location] they told of it . it was recorded in the palaces of travancore . and all the lands that lay between ; and in an evil hour -- may the gods curse the mother that bore him ! it reached the ears of allah u din .
she hesitated a moment , and then stepped forward , for what purpose he well understood . `` there , '' he said , pushing her gently away , as her lips barely touched his grizzled cheek . `` did he make up to you ? '' her mother was about to ask . but the words were only half out of her mouth before her daughter sank down into one of the chairs close to the kitchen table and . laying her head on her arm , burst forth into soft .
she was his altogether , she wanted him to know all that could be known of her . and since she felt that so much of her was the product of roscarna . it was necessary that he should know roscarna first . with the spells of moonshine withdrawn he knew it for the wan . neglected ruin that it was , but her romantic passion for its stones helped to maintain the first atmosphere of illusion .
he had even desired that female relatives should follow him to the grave . and poor sister [male] had taken a difficult journey for this purpose from the chalky flats . she and [male] would have been altogether cheered by this sign that a brother who disliked seeing them while he was living had been prospectively fond of their presence when he should have become a testator . if the sign had not been made equivocal by being extended to mrs. [female] , whose expense in handsome crape seemed to imply the most presumptuous hopes . aggravated by a bloom of complexion which told pretty plainly that she was not a blood relation .
she was very busy and rather sad , she was helping aunt [female] to close the house and getting her small wardrobe in order . and once a day she went to a school of languages and painfully learned from a fierce and kindly old frenchman a list of french nouns and prefixes like this . le livre , le crayon . [female] plume , [female] fenêtre . and so on , by the end of ten days she could say .
two varieties only of humanity could have entered the paddock with the ghostlike glide of that mysterious figure . they were a woman and a gipsy man . a woman was out of the question in such an occupation at this hour . and the comer could be no less than a thief , who might probably have known the weakness of the household on this particular night . and have chosen it on that account for his daring attempt .
throwing herself on the ground , she picked a big yellow daisy from a cluster . that , finding a little moisture oozing from a dirt filled crevice of the rock . had managed to live , and began pulling it to pieces , one by one . the petals from the big daisy fell from the girl 's hand . dull splashes of gold against her dress and on the grass .
poor [female] entreated each of them to begin , but her entreaties were of no avail . `` he is an ill mannered cub , '' the old man said . and i was a fool to let him into the house . do not mention his name to me again , [male] argued the matter more at length . [male] spoke to him of his own interest in the matter .
`` really , count marlanx , you are most amusing , '' she interrupted , with a laugh that stung him to the quick . you have been unique in your love making , i am not used to your methods . besides , after having known them , i will confess that i do not like them in the least . you may have been wonderfully successful in the past , but you were not dealing with an [female] girl .
it would presently be his task to take the bandage from this young woman 's eyes . and bid her look forth on the world . but how many generations of the women who had gone to her making had descended bandaged to the family vault ? he shivered a little , remembering some of the new ideas in his scientific books . and the much cited instance of the [location] cave fish .
for [male] only stared vacantly in the water , holding his rod in a loose . listless hand , and with a strange , far-away look in his eyes . as the church clock struck two he threw down his rod . and , striding away along the bank , left [male] to enjoy a nap which . according to that gentleman 's habits , was by no means unlikely to last for two or three hours .
when [female] went to call the aids to tea she found that dora was not in the parlor . mrs. [female] said davy had come to the front door and called her out . a hasty consultation with marilla in the pantry resulted in a decision to let both children have their teas together later on . tea was half over when the dining room was invaded by a forlorn figure . marilla and [female] stared in dismay .
[female] closed her lips , moving forward until she reached the space where the ragged boys and the fringed girls floated their white banners . where lacy yellow and lavender blooms caressed each other . there on the highest place she could select , across a moss covered log . she spread the waterproof sheet , and seating herself . motioned mrs. minturn to do the same , she reached for the music and opening it ran over the score .
a blazing sun upon a fierce august day was no greater rarity in southern [location] then . than at any other time , before or since , everything in marseilles . and about marseilles , had stared at the fervid sky . and been stared at in return , until a staring habit had become universal there . strangers were stared out of countenance by staring white houses .
he told me i must get somebody in the place to come and buy [male] as servants . and who must answer for [male] to the governor of the country . if he demanded us , i told him we should do as he should direct . so he brought a planter to treat with him . as it were , for the purchase of these two servants .
i said to myself that after all i could not abandon miss tita . and i continued to say this even while i observed that she quite failed to comply with my earnest request ( i had given her two or three addresses . at little towns , post restante ) . that she would let me know how she was getting on . i would have made my servant write to me but that he was unable to manage a pen .
[male] , following his friend , cajoled the women who admired his beauty . pushed back the men who felt the rigidity of his muscles . and both opened , thanks to these maneuvers , the compact and muddy tide of the populace . they arrived in sight of the two gibbets . from which [male] turned away his eyes in disgust .
the ladies who directly suggested this comparison were of a kind accustomed to take similar risks with more gratifying results . mrs. [female] had in fact long been the triumphant alternative of those who could not `` see '' alexa glennard 's looks . and mrs. [female] 's claims to consideration were founded on that distribution of effects which is the wonder of those who admire a highly cultivated country . the third lady of the trio which glennard 's fancy had put to such unflattering uses . was bound by circumstances to support the claims of the other two , this was mrs. [female] .
aunt [female] was particularly funny in her new position of mother to a callow poet and conducted herself like a proud but bewildered hen when one of her brood takes to the water . she pored over the poems , trying to appreciate them but quite failing to do so . for life was all prose to her , and she vainly tried to discover where [male] got his talent from . it was pretty to see the new respect with which she treated his possessions now . the old books were dusted with a sort of reverence .
`` let 's go , '' he said , there is little or no demonstrativeness in the domestic relations of mountaineers . the kiss of courtship is the only one known , there were no good bys . only that short `` let 's go , '' june sprang behind her father from the porch . the step mother handed her the bundle which she clutched in her lap . and they simply rode away , the step mother and bub silently gazing after them .
jill possessed in an unusual degree that instinct for exploration which is implanted in most of us . she was frankly inquisitive , and could never be two minutes in a strange room without making a tour of it and examining its books . pictures , and photographs , almost at once she began to prowl . the mantelpiece was her first objective , she always made for other people 's mantelpieces . for there , more than anywhere else , is the character of a proprietor revealed .
but the following day , when we came to the road , they smiled . they smiled to [male] and for us . and we smiled in answer , their head fell back . and their arms fell , as if their arms and their thin white neck were stricken suddenly with a great lassitude . they were not looking upon us , but upon the sky .
paul groaned aloud as he crushed the letter in his hand . then he went back to the western drawing room , he heard strange noises in the empty rooms as he passed by their open doors . weird creaking sounds and melancholy moanings in the wide chimneys . it seemed as if all the ghosts of [male] towers were astir to night . moved by an awful prescience of some coming horror , [male] was an atheist .
the whole party were in the wide lower balcony , in the courtyard the first objects that met vronsky 's eyes were a band of singers in white linen coats . standing near a barrel of vodka , and the robust , good humored figure of the colonel surrounded by officers . he had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was loudly shouting across the band that played offenbach 's quadrille . waving his arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing on one side . a group of soldiers , a quartermaster .
i already felt stronger by reason of [male] 's accession . as to bates , my mind was still numb and bewildered , he always liked or disliked new people unequivocally . and i was glad to see that he surveyed the big clergyman with approval . he listened quietly to the end while i told him of my experience with [male] . of the tunnel into the chapel crypt .
[male] appeared at [location] house early in the afternoon . he had calculated that his work must needs be very near its completion . and he came prepared to hear of [male] mortal illness . the blow that awaited him was a death blow , miss brewer had told [female] . the lies , the artifices , by which the man carton had contrived to make himself a constant visitor in that house .
sir [male] obeyed her without further comment . instinctively he felt that hers now was the stronger mind . he was willing to give himself over to her guidance . to become the hand , whilst she was the directing hand . he went to the door of the inner room .
but when he left the chamber he trusted mr. [male] altogether . and was very glad that he had sought his aid , he was tired and exhausted when he reached home . as he had eaten nothing but a biscuit or two since his breakfast . but his wife got him food and tea . and then asked him as to his success , `` was my [male] kind to you ? ''
stoddard had left me to go to the other end of the platform to speak to some of the students . i followed pickering rather loathly to where the companions of his travels were pacing to and fro in the crisp morning air . i laugh still whenever i remember that morning at annandale station . as soon as pickering had got me well under way in conversation with [male] . he excused himself hurriedly and went off , as i assumed .
and while the tucket was sounding , bennet moved close to the bewildered parson . and whispered violently in his ear , hatch and sir [male] discussed together for a while their altered situation . ten men , it was decided between them . should be reserved , not only to garrison the moat house , but to escort the priest across the wood . in the meantime , as bennet was to remain behind , the command of the reinforcement was given to master [male] .
while i was still wondering another litter came up alongside of mine . in it -- for the curtains were drawn -- sat an old man . clothed in a whitish robe , made apparently from coarse linen , that hung loosely about him . who , i at once jumped to the conclusion , was the shadowy figure that had stood on the bank and been addressed as `` father . '' he was a wonderful looking old man , with a snowy beard .
[female] was seated next to the door , before her husband could prevent her . she slipped out , she ran to the garden gate . which was shut , passed through it , and deliberately pushed it in his face . the noise alarmed [female] , [female] saw her rise with an unfamiliar movement . and , rushing into the porch , learnt the simple explanation of all their fears .
i must tell you about them all at killaloe . they certainly are very unhappy at the idea of your resigning , your father says very little . but i made him own that to act as you are acting for the sake of principle is very grand . i would not leave him till he had said so . and he did say it , dear mrs. finn does not understand it as well .
the grasses are then the greenest , and the young foliage of the trees . while it has all the glory and all the colour of spring vegetation . does not hide the form of the branches as do the heavy masses of the larger leaves which come in the advancing summer . and of all villas near [location] the horns was the sweetest . the broad green lawn swept down to the very margin of the thames .
in the unnatural [female] of having gone through the dreaded arrest , and got there . the first change of feeling which the prison most commonly induced . and from which dangerous resting place so many men had slipped down to the depths of degradation and disgrace by so many ways . he could think of some passages in his life . almost as if he were removed from them into another state of existence .
then [female] began again to soothe her gently , to tell her that her husband was in no great danger as yet . that he was well known for his loyalty , and to do her best to answer the girl 's pitiful questions . and marjorie sat back and considered , marjorie had a remarkable knowledge of the methods of the government . gathered from the almost endless stories she had heard from travelling priests and others . it was her business .
rushbrook in vain entreated lord elmwood . he laid his commands upon him not to go a step from the castle . while the agitation of his own mind , was too great , to observe the rigour of this sentence on his nephew . during the hasty preparations for the earl 's departure . sandford received from miss woodley the sad intelligence of what had happened .
he , your brother , seemed to be much distressed by what has been done . and i was grieved on his behalf , mr [male] . the younger mr [male] , -- expressed himself in a very different way . he at first declined to discuss the matter with me . and when i told him that if that was his way i would certainly expose him .
just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor tapped with his stick . some latecomers took their seats in the stalls . and the curtain rose , as soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent . and all the men , old and young , in uniform and evening dress , and all the women with gems on their bare flesh . turned their whole attention with eager curiosity to the stage .
those were the only two who spoke , when they were silent again , nothing stirred in the stillness but the bubble and the crackle of the flames . a harsh rattling sound in the distance -- then the hollow beat of horses hoofs at full gallop -- then the low roar . the all predominant tumult of hundreds of human voices clamouring and shouting together . the engine at last , the people about me all turned from the fire .
so ollie had come back to his old home to measure things by his new standard . and he had come back , too , to be measured according to the old , old standard . if the man 's eyes were dimmed by the flash and sparkle that play upon the surface of life . the woman 's vision was strong and clear to look into the still depths . later in the day , as they walked together up the old trail to sammy 's lookout .
on wednesday morning [male] got up before it was light . and stole downstairs and out of the kitchen door just as old ivar was making his morning ablutions at the pump . [male] nodded to him and hurried up the draw . past the garden , and into the pasture where the milking cows used to be kept . the dawn in the east looked like the light from some great fire that was burning under the edge of the world .
`` that is not true , '' said [male] , by his determined rattling he had now collected the animated attention of some half dozen apes . either to propitiate them , or to show his consideration for their feelings . he proceeded to offer them the apple which he held . the sight , unfortunately , was so comically apt in its illustration of the picture in her mind . the ruse was so transparent , that katharine was seized with laughter .
demi , finding business dull . solaced his leisure by photographing everybody he could induce to sit or stand to him . producing some excellent pictures among many failures ; for he had a pretty taste in grouping . and endless patience , he might be said to view the world through the lens of his camera . and seemed to enjoy himself very much squinting at his fellow beings from under a bit of [male] cambric .
and now he , [male] , was about to put forth this second venture . not of his own desire or free will indeed , but because his reason and judgment were over mastered . in short , he had fallen in love with [male] when he first saw her five years ago . and was now in the process of discovering the fact , there he sat in his chair in the old half furnished room . which he proposed to turn into his dining room , and groaned in spirit over this portentous discovery .
often , alas , the thing was provable ; and , where he did not find . he was quick to invent ; and , where he failed in finding or inventing . he not the less believed the bad motive was there , and followed the slightest seeming trail of the cunning demon only the more eagerly . what a smile was his when he heard , which truly he was not in the way to hear often . the praise of some good deed , or an ascription of high end to some endeavor of one of the vile race to which he belonged !
truscomb , it appeared , had made no allusion to dillon . his avowed purpose in summoning his assistant had been to discuss with the latter the question of the proposed nursery and schools . mrs. westmore , at amherst 's suggestion . had presented these projects as her own ; but the question of a site having come up . she had mentioned to truscomb his assistant 's proposal that the company should buy for the purpose the notorious eldorado .
the stranger appeared confounded : she felt an almost resistless impulse to depart immediately . but something stronger than resentment told her to stay . it was distress , she paused a moment . and then , with a sigh , took up the part , and , without looking at harleigh . who was too much shocked to offer any palliation for this grossness , walked pensively to her chamber .
they had not arrived till late , missing again , by a series of mischances . the scouts marjorie had posted ; and , on discovering their danger . had further discovered the house to be already watched , they judged it better . therefore , as marjorie said in her letter , to feign unconsciousness of any charge against them . since there was no priest in the house who could incriminate them .
beverly calhoun sat on the balcony with the princess long after midnight . the sky was [female] with the clouds of an approaching storm . the air was heavy with foreboding silence , twice , from their darkened corner near the pillar . they saw baldos as he paced steadily past the castle on patrol . with haddan at his side , dreamily the watchers in the cool balcony looked down upon the somber park and its occasional guardsman .
he had set himself down before the gates of the city of fashion . and had taken them by storm ; or , perhaps , to speak with more propriety . he had picked the locks and let himself in . in his walks of life he was somebody in [location] . a man at the west end who did not know who was [male] crosbie knew nothing .
the spring was coming ; that was its breath , which you know unmistakably in [location] after all the kisses that winter gives . some birds were singing in the trees ; down an alley into which he could look . between the high walls of green , he could see two people in flirtation . he waited patiently till the young man should put his arm round the girl 's waist . for the fleeting embrace from which she pushed it and fled further down the path .
the fog had closed in behind him as heavily as in front . shutting off all possibility of retreat ; all about him in the darkness was a confusion of voices . cheerful , dubious , alarmed , or angry ; now and then a sleeve brushed his or a hand touched him tentatively . it was a strange moment , a moment of possibilities . to which the crunching wheels , the oaths and laughter from the blocked traffic of the road way .
these were the painful reflections which occupied the mind of [female] . [location] had placed her in a small house a few miles from [location] . he gave her one female attendant . and supplied her with what money she wanted ; but business and pleasure so entirely occupied his time . that he had little to devote to the woman , whom he had brought from all her connections .
it was usual at lapton for the pupils to go home for a long week-end at half term . she wondered if mrs. [female] would like to come back to overton with [female] ? the rest and change would do her good . and it would be interesting for gabrielle , who had seen so little of england . to visit cotswold , mrs. [organization] promised to take great care of her .
sir , said sir [male] , now is it time . this is all that i will desire , that ye will give me [female] beale isoud . your daughter , not for myself , but for mine uncle . king mark , that shall have her to wife . for so have i promised him , alas , said the king .
then tristan showed the dragons tongue and offered the seneschal battle . but the seneschal looked at his face and dared not , my lords . you have said it , and it is truth . i killed the morholt , but i crossed the sea to offer you a good blood fine . to ransom that deed and get me quit of it .
it was that of lady [female] ; she did not herself like the [female] . and signed only her second name [female] at full length . whence her friends generally called her to each other lady malice . she did not leave the carriage , but continued to recline motionless in it . at an angle of forty five degrees , wrapped in furs .
said [male] , `` immediately upon a death , when all the property left is real property . '' `` very hard indeed , '' said mr scruby , who had heard with accuracy all the particulars of the old squire 's will . vavasor understood the lawyer , cursed him inwardly , and suggested to himself that some day he might murder mr scruby as well as [male] . and perhaps also a few more of his enemies , two days after the interview in which his own note of hand had been refused . he again called in great marlborough street , upon this occasion he tendered to mr scruby for his approval the four slips of paper which have been mentioned .
the jailer came in the evening , dantes was on his bed . it seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening . doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes . for the jailer said , `` come , are you going mad again ? '' dantes did not answer . he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him .
he bowed them away , in a dignified and graceful manner . still standing on the hay cart , the honest folk trooped off , having no more time to waste . and left the field in possession of mr. [male] . his co mate , and ourselves ; whom i do not think he had as yet noticed . he descended from the cart , his companion burst into roars of laughter .
when [male] saw him coming , in bare feet . triddle traddle , triddle traddle , up the school house floor , his indignation at the boy for being later than usual rose to fiery wrath for being drenched as well . waiting for no explanation , concluding that pete had been fishing for crabs among the stones of port lewaigue . he burst into a loud volley of his accustomed expletives . and timed and punctuated them by a thwack of the cane between every word .
every day was to these families a day of happiness and tranquillity . neither ambition nor envy [male] their repose . they did not seek to obtain a useless reputation out of doors . which may be procured by artifice and lost by calumny ; but were contented to be the sole witnesses and judges of their own actions . in this island , where , as is the case in most [location] .
he gambled a little , for he found that there was considerable diversion in risking interesting sums on the spin of a wheel or the fortuitous roll of a ball . and he took more and more to drinking , not in the sense that a drunkard takes to it . but as a high liver , socially , and with all his friends , he was inclined to drink the rich drinks when he did not take straight whiskey . champagne , sparkling burgundy , the expensive and effervescent white wines . when he drank he could drink a great deal .
happily , mr. [male] had one intellectual passion , which , poor thing as it was . and in its motive , most of its aspects , and almost all its tendencies . evil exceedingly , yet did something to delay that corruption of his being which , at the same time . it powerfully aided to complete : it was for the understanding and analysis of human evil . not in the abstract , but alive and operative , for the appeasement of this passion .
a wife , somebody to talk things over with . one had a right , damn it , one had a right , soames had travelled little . aged nineteen he had made the `` petty tour '' with his father . mother , and [male] -- [location] , the rhine . [location] , and home by way of [location] .
two green martian communities had been wiped off the face of barsoom by the avenging fleets . but no trace of dejah thoris had been found . they had been searching among the northern hordes , and only within the past few days had they extended their [male] to the south . [male] had been detailed to one of the small one-man fliers and had had the misfortune to be discovered by the warhoons while exploring their city . the bravery and daring of the man won my greatest respect and admiration .
i think that , young as [female] was , this mournful period was the grand crisis of her life . the past , with its one great affection , had been swept away from her . and as yet there was no friendly figure to fill the dismal blank of the future . had any kindly matron , any gentle [female] creature been ready to stretch out her arms to the desolate orphan . [female] 's heart would have melted , and she would have crept to the shelter of that womanly embrace .
she wore a cool muslin that morning . white , with a waving vertical line of brown running through it . also a white linen collar and the big straw hat which she had taken from the [female] outside the door . the hat rested any way on her yellow brown hair . that waved a little , was heavy , and clung close to her head , madame ratignolle .
katherine is not so faithless as her ways might lead you to believe . [female] without dark eyes would be impossible , and her predestined petrarch would never deliver his sonnets . [male] may be seen only against a background of trojan wall . [male] must be tall and fair and ready with ballads in the winter twilight . [female] 's reserve and discretion commend her to you .
they had been living in the same small family party . since [male] 's coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other . and [male] , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state . and captain [male] was not inconsolable , that was a point which [male] had not been able to avoid suspecting before . and instead of drawing the same conclusion as [male] , from the present course of events .
it was a chateau ; it is no longer anything but a farm . for the antiquary , hougomont is hugomons , this manor was built by [female] . sire of somerel , the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the abbey of villiers . the traveller pushed open the door , elbowed an ancient calash under the porch . and entered the courtyard , the first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the sixteenth century .
`` am i to get down too ? '' she asked in a helpless way . over the gateway to the churchyard there was an arch of flowers and evergreens . with an inscription in coloured letters : `` god bless the happy pair . '' the sloping path going down as to a dell was strewn with gilvers and slips of [location] . at the bottom stood the old church mantled in ivy , like a rock of the sea covered by green moss .
mrs. [female] told me he was from [location] . very learned and good , but poor as a church mouse , and gives lessons to support himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here . according to the wishes of his sister , who married an american , not a very romantic story . but it interested me , and i was glad to hear that mrs. [male] lends him her parlor for some of his scholars . there is a glass door between it and the nursery .
`` our friend [female] finn , '' said lady [female] , speaking still with an excited voice , -- with a voice that was intended to display excitement . if there was to be a battle on this matter , there should be a battle . she would display all her anxiety for her young friend . and fling it in her husband 's face if he chose to take it as an injury .
the soft white mist came thicker around me . as the evening fell ; and the peat ricks here and there . and the furze hucks of the summer time , were all out of shape in the twist of it . by and by , i began to doubt where i was . or how come there , not having seen a gibbet lately ; and then i heard the draught of the wind up a hollow place with rocks to it .
from all these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there was now the whole french army marching from [location] in an unexpected direction . along the kaluga road , dokhturov was unwilling to undertake any action . as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do . he had been ordered to attack forminsk , but only broussier had been there at that time and now the whole french army was there . ermolov wished to act on his own judgment , but dokhturov insisted that he must have kutuzov 's instructions .
i explained that i had not contradicted myself . that she had not rightly interpreted my words , i knew , i said . something about the principal features of the different countries of the world . as , for instance , the largest mountain ranges . and rivers , and the cities , also something .
for both his victims time brings [male] . a sober gladness that is not without its charm , for one a child 's affection . a child 's growing [male] of mind and form . bring a happiness on , clouded at intervals by the dark shadows of past sorrow . but in the heart of [male] there is an empty place which can never be filled upon earth .
`` yes ; lady [male] was at home , '' said the porter . not stirring to make any further inquiry , it was no business of his if mr [male] chose to receive such a guest . he had not been desired to say that her ladyship was not at home . [female] was therefore admitted and shown direct up into the room in which lady [female] was sitting . as chance would have it , she was alone .
they anticipate war between their sovereigns . the position seems to them insoluble , but the wave they feel to be rising does not come from the quarter they expect . it rises again from the same point as before -- [location] . the last backwash of the movement from the west occurs . a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of history . the man who had devastated [location] returns to [location] alone .
his house stood recessed from the road , and the stables . which are to a farm what a fireplace is to a room . were behind , their lower portions being lost amid bushes of laurel . inside the blue door , open half-way down , were to be seen at this time the backs and tails of half a dozen warm and contented horses standing in their stalls . and as thus viewed , they presented alternations of roan and bay .
something of the golden glory of his beauty had faded . he was no longer the young [male] , fresh and radiant with the divinity of the skies . he had suffered ; and suffering had left its traces on his countenance . that smiling hopefulness , that supreme confidence in a bright future . which is the virginity of beauty , had perished beneath the withering influence of affliction .
after which his eyes darkened and closed , his face grew ashy pale . the hands whitened , and the colossus sank quite down , breathing his last sigh . with him sank the rock , which , even in his dying agony he had still held up . the three men dropped the levers , which rolled upon the tumulary stone . then , breathless , pale , his brow covered with sweat .
there was no pause whatever after the solemn charge to the couple . so if [female] and [female] had any secrets to disclose . they had perforce to keep them for after discussion . then [female] found her right hand firmly clasped in [female] 's . and no inadequacy of the church 's mouth piece could destroy the exquisite beauty of the church 's words .
then setting the string going like a pendulum , she stood back a pace with hands clasped behind her . and snapped at the apple as it swung , sometimes catching it . sometimes missing it , sometimes marking it , sometimes biting it . her body bending and rising with its waggle . and nod , and [female] , her mouth opening and closing .
had she closed the lid of the bureau ? she was compelled to return in order to make sure , yes , it was closed . when at length she lay in bed . breathless , her heart violently beating , her feet like icicles . she realised what she had done , she had saved willie price .
the indian without further ceremony threw his pack to the ground . and , squatting on his heels , watched the white man 's preparations . when the meal was cooked , he coolly produced a knife . selected a clean bit of hemlock bark . and helped himself , then he lit a pipe .
throughout the day people had been passing and repassing through the great hall . there , on a stately bier surmounted by a crown and the drooping folds of the royal banner . lay rudolf rassendyll , the highest officer guarded him . in the cathedral the archbishop said a mass for his soul . he had lain there three days .
rodolphe leant forward and removed them as they rode along . at other times , to turn aside the branches , he passed close to her . and emma felt his knee brushing against her leg . the sky was now blue , the leaves no longer stirred , there were spaces full of heather in flower . and plots of violets alternated with the confused patches of the trees that were grey .
and when , as in this case , the son wishes to marry one whom his father may not wholly approve . whom his mother does not heartily love , surely the pain is deepened tenfold , those who in the dazzled vision of youth see only the beauty and splendour of love . first love , who deem it comprises the whole of life . beginning , aim , and end -- may marvel that i . who have been young and now am old , see as i saw that night .
we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of [female] . if , as we hope , our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work . they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual , who is wholly unchanged . except that he is twenty years older , an advance in life that has made him only more silent . although , since the change that had been working in himself , [male] had given [male] permission to speak .
however humble i might be , no one knowing anything of our part of the country . would for a moment doubt that now here was a great to do and talk of [male] and his wedding . the fierce fight with the doones so lately , and my leading of the combat ( though i fought not more than need be ) . and the vanishing of sir counsellor . and the galloping madness of carver , and the religious fear of the women that this last was gone to hell .
courvoisier looked up as i came in , for one half moment there leaped into his eyes a look of surprise and of something more . if it had lasted a second longer i could have sworn it was welcome . then it was gone , he rose , turned the child over to [male] . saying , `` one moment , [male] , '' then turned to me as to some stranger who had come on an errand as yet unknown to him . and did not speak , the little one , from [male] 's knee , stared at me with large .
but before this i had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing past the king on my way to the brook . it was ten yards away , when i got back and entered . the king was within , and was opening the shutter that closed the window hole , to let in air and light . the place was full of a foul stench , i put the bowl to the woman 's lips . and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came open and a strong light flooded her face , smallpox !
who would ever think of looking for modern treasure in the burying place of the ancient dead ? in those days , too , molehill , or dead man 's mount . belonged to the [male] molle family . who had re acquired it on the break up of the abbey . it was only at the restoration , when the dofferleigh branch came into possession under the will of the second and last baronet .
early in may , [male] came round to say that [male] had been wounded in the leg by a spent bullet . and was to be discharged , his wife was nursing him , he would have a little limp . nothing to speak of , he wanted his grandfather to buy him a farm out there where he could breed horses . her father was giving holly eight hundred a year , so they could be quite comfortable . because his grandfather would give [male] five , he had said .
lady ongar had been a fortnight in the country before she received madame gordeloup 's letter . in that letter the sister had declared herself to be most anxious that her brother should see lady ongar . the letter had been in french , and had been very eloquent -- more eloquent in its cause than any letter with the same object could have been if written by an englishwoman in english . and the eloquence was less offensive than it might , under all concurrent circumstances . have been had it reached lady ongar in english , the reader must not .
thorpe cared for just three people , and none of them happened to clash with his machine . they were wallace carpenter , little [male] . and injin [male] , wallace , for reasons already explained at length . was always personally agreeable to thorpe , latterly , since the erection of the mill . he had developed unexpected acumen in the disposal of the season 's cut to wholesale dealers in [location] .
your father had written me a very polite letter . in order that i might consent to see him . he did not present himself quite as he had written . his manner at first was so stiff , insolent , and even threatening , that i had to make him understand that i was in my own house . and that i had no need to render him an account of my life .
these words , carelessly spoken , galled sir [male] to the quick . but he tried to conceal his pain , and parted from his nephew with affected gaiety of spirit . alone in his own study , he pondered long and moodily over the events of the day . he shrank from the society of his wife . her tender words irritated him .
he bowed and as they disappeared from the great hall the hubbub of voices became tumultuous . approaching the place by the small door connecting it with the hall way in which i stood . i took a hurried look within , and , seeing no one , stepped boldly down between the palms to the little nook where lovers of this quiet spot were accustomed to sit . it was empty , and so was the library beyond , coming back , i accosted [male] . whom i found superintending the removal of the potted plants which encumbered the passages .
as he arrived at this conclusion , they paused before the entrance of the queen 's pavilion . they were of course admitted by the guards . and neville , leaving the nubian in a small apartment , or antechamber , which was but too well remembered by him . passed into that which was used as the queen 's presence chamber , he communicated his royal master 's pleasure in a low and respectful tone of voice . very different from the bluntness of [female] , to whom [female] was everything and the rest of the court .
he could speak a little spanish , and also a language which nobody understood . unless it was the mocking bird that hung on the other side of the door . whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with maddening persistence . mr. pontellier , unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort . arose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust .
he had often said to himself that he had done wrong in making that concession to despair . he had confined himself to gradually estranging [male] from his house and to effacing him . as much as possible , from cosette 's mind , he had . in a manner , always placed himself between cosette and [female] . sure that , in this way , she would not perceive nor think of the latter .
the last pages to which the chronicler of these lives would ask the reader 's attention are concerned with the scene in and out of jude 's bedroom when leafy summer came round again . [female] , hatted , gloved , and ready , sat down and waited , as if expecting some one to come and take her place as nurse . she looked again at jude , critically gauged his ebbing life . as she had done so many times during the late months . and glancing at his watch , which was hung up by way of timepiece , rose impatiently .
she would cut it at three o'clock . it was now nearly eleven , eight hours , blood poisoning could not possibly develop so soon . `` oh , god , '' she cried , and kneeling beside the bed began smoothing back julie 's hair over and over . with a vague idea of getting some hot water , she rose and stared toward the door . but the lace of her dress caught in the bed rail and she fell forward on her hands and knees .
the maiden asked why he looked so sad , and , won by her gentleness . he told her how his master had been hated by the lady ettarde . and betrayed by the false knight sir gawaine . `` bring me to your master , '' said the lady of the lake . and when she had come to the tent and saw sir pelleas .
along the corridor , agreeably conscious of the hum of admiration she aroused . came lillian astrupp , surrounded by a little court , her delicate face was lit up . her eyes shone under the faint gleam of her hair . her gown of gold embroidery swept round her gracefully . she was radiant and triumphant , but she was also excited , the excitement was evident in her laugh .
pastor wundt , the shepherd of the columbus church . was a sincere and ardent [male] , but his bigotry and hard and fast orthodoxy made him intolerant . he considered that the members of his flock were jeopardizing their eternal salvation if they danced . played cards , or went to theaters , and he did not hesitate to declare vociferously that hell was yawning for those who disobeyed his injunctions . drinking , even temperately , was a sin , smoking -- well .
he had reasons for not being extravagant ; but seldom had a like sum brought such returns . he began drawing interest as he watched leslie . never had her form seemed so perfect , her dress so becoming and simple . how could other women make a vulgar display in the same pattern that clothed her modestly ? how wonderful were the soft coils of her hair , the tints paling and flushing on her cheeks .
[male] took no heed of the grey eyes that watched him with such a vengeful light in their fixed gaze . he was still thinking of his missing wife , still feeling , to a degree that was intolerably painful . that miserable dream like sense of helplessness and prostration . he asked himself this question . because the extreme anguish , the intense anxiety , which he had endured .
he turned out the lamp and went slowly up the stairs . outside his wife 's door he paused . and , without knocking , tried the knob -- to find the door locked against him . a deep flush of resentment spread over his cheeks . he drew back his hand , being minded to rap peremptorily -- then he refrained and went on to his own room .
[male] longed to say something tender and comfortable . but no fitting words came to him , so he stood silent . gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do , it was the best thing he could have done . far more soothing than the most eloquent words , for jo felt the unspoken sympathy . and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow .
to those , however , he was very well disposed to attach himself , lady [male] . in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . while he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them . he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour . and as for mrs smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently .
as she spoke she smiled ever so sweetly , but she certainly had not learned to call him plantagenet as yet . he went up to [location] and immediately got himself to work . the accurate and voluminous speech came off with considerable credit to himself . credit of that quiet , enduring kind which is accorded to such men . the speech was respectable , dull , and correct , men listened to it .
philip stood under a great broad stone archway . the back door into the warden 's house was on the right side . a kind of buttery hatch was placed by the porter 's door on the opposite side . after some consideration , [male] knocked at the closed shutter . and the signal seemed to be well understood , he heard a movement within .
[male] galloped on , mad in the pain of his wound . heading straight toward the fire , [male] believed , as those who urged him on toward it believed . that no horseman ever rode could jump that fiery gorge . on the brink of it his pursuers would stop . while he , powerless to check or turn his horse .
miss granger observed that she painted more than usual lately -- merely for the sake of seeing him . and how about [male] ? well , that flirtation , of course . was of later date and a less serious affair , jealousy -- a new kind of jealousy . more bitter even than that which she had felt when clarissa came between her and her father . sharpened miss granger 's suspicions in this case .
but one grief did weigh heavily on [female] , she continually heard her mother say things which made her feel that it would be more than ever impossible that [female] should be at her wedding . and yet she had promised her brother to ask her . [male] had also repeated his threat , that if [male] were not present . he would absent himself , [male] did what most girls do in such a case . what all would do who are worth anything ; she asked her lover 's advice .
bade him for his life be careful what he was about . and then stole out on tiptoe to open the door for him . [male] , anticipating the last movement , was on the staircase . the sequence of things was so ordinary and natural , that , standing there , she could hear the door open . feel the night air , and see the stars outside .
all three were supplied with immense horns of dampierre , wound with green worsted cords . leaving only the brass tubes visible ; but they controlled their dogs by the eye and voice . those noble animals were far more faithful and submissive subjects than the human lieges whom the king was at that moment addressing . all were marked with white , [male] , or liver spots , each having as distinctive a countenance as the soldiers of [male] . their eyes flashing like diamonds at the slightest noise .
tears choked him , and leaning his elbows on the window sill be began to cry . sobbing like a child , the door opened , the doctor with his shirt sleeves tucked up . without a coat , pale and with a trembling jaw . came out of the room , prince [male] turned to him . but the doctor gave him a bewildered look and passed by without a word .
both followed the same route ; the quadruple echoes of this new race course were confounded . [male] had not yet perceived [male] , but on issuing from the slope . a single echo struck the air ; it was that of the steps of [male] 's horse . which rolled along like thunder , [male] turned round . and saw behind him , within a hundred paces , his enemy bent over the neck of his horse .
the blinds of [female] 's bedroom were still closely drawn . for she was no early riser , all the life visible was in the shape of a solitary thrush cracking a small snail upon the door stone for his breakfast . and his tapping seemed a loud noise in the general silence which prevailed . but on going to the door clym found it unfastened . the young girl who attended upon [female] being astir in the back part of the premises .
maria , with only mr. [male] to attend to her , and doomed to the repeated details of his day 's sport . good or bad , his boast of his dogs , his jealousy of his neighbours . his doubts of their qualifications , and his zeal after poachers . subjects which will not find their way to female feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment on the other . had missed mr. [male] grievously ; and [male] , unengaged and unemployed , felt all the right of missing him much more .
but what availed his sympathy ? no education had given him wisdom . and without wisdom , even love , with all its effects , too often works but harm . he acted to the best of his judgment , but it was a widely erring judgment . the actions of the uneducated seem to me typified in those of frankenstein . that monster of many human qualities , ungifted with a soul .
she was watching him intently , some of the meaning in his face had found a pained . alarmed reflection in her own , but the awe and wonder of the morning 's discovery still colored her mind too vividly to allow of other considerations possessing their proper value . the thrill of exultation with which the misgivings born of [organization] 's vice had dropped away from her mental image of loder was still too absorbing to be easily dominated . she loved , and as if by a miracle her love had been justified ! for the moment the justification was all sufficing , something of confidence .
the director , tired from a long rehearsal , reluctantly consented to listen to him . likewise , the bored company of actors , strindberg went on `` to do or die , '' and was soon shouting like a revivalist , and made such it bad impression that he was advised to go to the dramatic school to study . he went home disgusted and heartsick , and , determined to take his life . swallowed an opium pill which he had long been keeping for that purpose .
the laughter ended in a scream of triumph . which rang through the house , she rushed at nugent dubourg . so blindly incapable of measuring her distance that she struck against him violently . and nearly threw him down , `` i know him , i know him ! '' she cried -- and flung her arms round his neck .
ranald looked at him curiously for a moment . and said : `` a swallow tail , perhaps , or a blanket , maybe , '' and he turned away leaving [male] more mystified than ever . soon after six , [male] paddled around in his [male] , and gave the stern to ranald . what a joy it was to him to be in a [male] stern again . to feel the rush of the water under his knees .
when breakfast was over she walked out by herself . and wandered about the village of allenham , indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning . the evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling . she played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to willoughby . every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined , and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her .
st. ewolds is worth £350 per annum . besides the house , which is sufficiently commodious for a moderate family , the population is about twelve hundred . of which more than a half consists of persons dwelling in an outskirt of the city . for the parish runs almost into barchester , i shall be glad to have your reply with as little delay as may suit your convenience . and in the event of your accepting the offer , -- which i sincerely trust you may be enabled to do .
at length the idea occurred at once to him that the whole might be a conspiracy against king [male] . formed within the camp of the allies , and to which the bishop . who was by some represented as a politic and unscrupulous person , was not unlikely to have been accessory . it was true that , in his own opinion , there existed no character so perfect as that of his master . for [male] being the flower of chivalry .
there was a chuckling note of pleasure in [male] whittemore 's voice as he leaned half across the table . his handsome face , bronzed by snow and wind . illumined in the lamp glow , [organization] , in strong contrast , with his round . smooth cheeks , slim hands , and build that was almost womanish , leaned over his side to meet him . for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands .
the knight has only one heart , and this one is really no longer his . but has been entrusted to some one else , so that he can not bestow it elsewhere . love , which holds all hearts beneath its sway . requires it to be lodged in a single place , all hearts ? no , only those which it esteems , and he whom love deigns to control ought to prize himself the more .
to fluff out her curls , put on fashionable dresses , and sing romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn herself to attract herself . to adorn herself for others might perhaps have been agreeable -- she did not know . but she had no time at all for it . the chief reason for devoting no time either to singing . to dress , or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these things .
the tray was soon hoisted down , and before the [female] clatter of cups and saucers began . the women disburdened themselves of their out of door things . and sent [male] upstairs with them . then came a long whispering , and chinking of money . to which mr. and mrs. [female] were too polite to attend ; knowing , as they did full well .
his readiness , however , in agreeing to dine at the parsonage , when the general invitation was at last hazarded . after many debates and many doubts as to whether it were worth while . `` because sir [male] so ill inclined , and lady bertram was so indolent ! '' proceeded from good breeding and goodwill alone , and had nothing to do with mr. [male] . but as being one in an agreeable group : for it was in the course of that very visit that he first began to think that any one in the habit of such idle observations would have thought that mr. [male] was the admirer of [male] price .
but already ranald had seen that this was necessary , and once more backed his team to readjust the chain which had slipped off the top . as he fastened the hook he heard a sharp `` back ! '' behind him , and he knew that the next moment [male] 's team would be away with their load . with a yell he sprang at his lines . lashed the blacks over the back , and called to them once more .
at length , on getting past an abrupt turn in the passage . through which i had to force myself , i saw . a few yards ahead of me , the long forgotten daylight shining through a small opening . to which the path , if path it could now be called , led me . with great difficulty i accomplished these last few yards .
here i told him i would live with him now till all my money was spent . but would not let him spend a shilling of his own , we had some kind squabble about that . but i told him it was the last time i was like to enjoy his company . and i desired he would let me be master in that thing only . and he should govern in everything else ; so he acquiesced .
but [female] was to go home with her . and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation , it was not without an effort . meanwhile , that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr. [female] 's proposals . to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish [female] . and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away .
at last came the day when my uncle hugh and his wife were expected home . though not until my scanty patience was well nigh wearied out -- and we were all assembled to meet them in the great hall . where a ruddy firelight was gleaming , my aunt [female] had dressed me in my best white frock and my crimson sash . with much lamenting over my skinny neck and arms . and bade me behave prettily , as became my bringing up , so i slipped in a corner .
she came into his arms without hesitation . her hands stroked his face ; and then she stood with her head against his shoulder . looking ahead , breathing deeply now of the sweet , clear air filled with the elixir of the hovering forests . she did not speak , or move , and kent remained quiet , the [location] drifted around a bend . shoreward a great moose splashed up out of the water , and they could hear him afterward .
the first sensible reflect i made was , that my husband was not by to see my disorder . and that i was very glad of it , the gentlemen had not been long in the house but they came to the window of their room . as is usual ; but my window was shut , you may be sure , however , i could not keep from peeping at them . and there i saw him again , heard him call out to one of the servants of the house for something he wanted . and received all the terrifying confirmations of its being the same person that were possible to be had .
while the men were discussing the matter , a thin , high pitched voice from the edge of the crowd . broke in , `` that there 's a good lift alright , but hit ai not nothin ', t '' what i seed when i was t th circus in th ', city . young [male] , who had started the engine again , turned quickly , [male] was sitting on a horse near by . and at his side , on the brown pony , was miss [female] .
[female] was delightfully gracious about the dinner -- i almost called it the debut dinner . and the expression on the judge 's face when he accepted ! i was glad she was sitting beside him and could not see . some women like to make other women unhappy , but i think it is best for you to keep them blissfully unconscious until you get what you want . anyhow , i like that girl all over , and i can not see that her neck is so absolutely impossibly flowery .
sir [male] house on the river has become a historic one . palatial in its dimensions , it stands in the midst of exquisitely laid out gardens . with a picturesque terrace and frontage to the river . built in tudor days , the old red brick of the walls looks eminently picturesque in the midst of a bower of green . the beautiful lawn , with its old sun dial , adding the true note of harmony to its foregrounds .
on the whole , i settled into an amiable state of mind . my perplexity over the shot of the night before was passing away under the benign influences of blue sky and warm [female] . a few farm folk passed me in the highway and gave me good morning in the fashion of the country . inspecting my knickerbockers at the same time with [male] disapproval . i reached the lake and gazed out upon its quiet waters with satisfaction .
deeply grieving over this disaster , [female] traynor hastened from the spot . but he had only reached the garden of the chiaja when he heard a faint . weak voice calling him by his name . he turned , and saw sir [male] . who , seated in a sort of portable arm chair , was enjoying the fresh air from the sea .
how little can you deprive me of , my love , after all ? whenever i set my ear to it . i can hear the flute which is playing , its fountain of melody gushing forth from the flute stops of separation . the immortal draught of the goddess is never exhausted , she sometimes breaks the bowl from which we drink it . only to smile at seeing [female] so disconsolate over the trifling loss , i will not stop to pick up my broken bowl .
we returned to the drawing room -- the room in which the happiest evenings of my life had been passed . the room which , after this last night , i was never to see again . its aspect was altered since the days had shortened and the weather had grown cold . the glass doors on the terrace side were closed . and hidden by thick curtains , instead of the soft twilight obscurity .
he reached home at half past nine , while the car was passing in at one drive gate he heard the grinding sputter of a motor cycle passing out by the other . young mont , no doubt , so fleur had not been lonely , but he went in with a sinking heart . in the cream panelled drawing room she was sitting with her elbows on her knees . and her chin on her clasped hands , in front of a white camellia plant which filled the fireplace . that glance at her before she saw him renewed his dread .
she was sure , she said to herself , he would forgive her . would set her at [female] with herself , and be unfair neither to mr. [male] nor to her . in the mean time she would take care . and this was a real resolve , not a mere act contemplated in the future . not to go where she might meet him again , nor was the resolve the less genuine that .
the packet of papers fell on the floor . he had extended his hand , and i had fastened thereon . oblivious of all else , i hardly knew what to do , i first caressed the soft velvet on his cuff , and then . i stroked the hand it surrounded . it was his foresight , his goodness .
and faint in that amazing glow , until the darkness close above . and they will know -- poor fools , they will know ! one moment , what it is to love , when love has changed to kindliness . oh , love , our hungry lips , that press so tight that time 's an old god 's dream nodding in heaven . and whisper stuff seven million years were not enough to think on after , make it seem less than the breath of children playing .
she not only liked to feel herself at a higher level of literary sentiment than the ladies with whom she associated . she wished not to be behind them in any point of social consideration . while [male] was seen in the light of a patronized musician . his peculiarities were picturesque and acceptable : but to see him by a sudden flash in the light of her son in law gave her a burning sense of what the world would say . and the poor lady had been used to represent her [male] as a model of excellence .
dearest : i have been doing something so wise and foolish . mentally wise , i mean , and physically foolish , do you guess ? -- disobeying your parting injunction . and sitting up to see eclipses , it was such a luxury to do as i was not told just for once . to feel there was an independent me still capable of asserting itself , my belief is that . waking , you hold me subjugated : but , once your godhead has put on its spiritual nightcap .
`` no , no , we must not do that , '' mother insisted , but regretfully . for she was already wondering where , if she were running things . she would put a sewing machine , she had always agreed with [male] tubbs that sewing machines belonged in bedrooms . while the maid shadowed him and mother opened her mouth to rebuke him . father boldly pushed open the door on the right , he had guessed correctly .
mr. [male] seated himself upon the timber by his wife 's side . and bent down to look at his son , and to kiss him gently without waking him . after that fond lingering kiss upon the little one 's smooth cheek . he sat for some minutes in silence . looking at his wife , it was only her profile he could see .
the door of the tower was shut , it was something more than the freakishness which is engendered by a sickening monotony that had led lady constantine thus far . and hence she made no ado about admitting herself . three years ago , when her every action was a thing of propriety . she had known of no possible purpose which could have led her abroad in a manner such as this . she ascended the tower noiselessly , on raising her head above the hatchway she beheld swithin bending over a scroll of paper which lay on the little table beside him .
i was very well dressed , and had my gold watch as well as she . so i left the footman , and i puts myself in a rank with this young lady . having stayed till she had taken one double turn in the mall . and was going forward again ; by and by i saluted her by her name . with the title of lady [female] , i asked her when she heard from her father .
no sooner did [male] 's eyes fall on the young man than she darted forward with a cry of recognition and exclaimed . `` why , [female] , how came you here ? '' as riches increased . so did mrs. [female] 's proud spirit , until she came to look upon herself as somewhat above the common order of her fellow beings . she endeavored to instil her ideas of exclusiveness into the minds of her children . with her daughter [female] , she succeeded admirably .
for an instant there was dead silence , the women looked at each other with blank eyes . as if they were as yet unable to take in the new idea that the conduct which had seemed to them a subject for such just pride could be regarded by any one as deserving of punishment or retribution . [male] before they had recovered from their amazement . perhaps [male] had better have held his tongue ; but he believed in the danger . which he was anxious to impress upon his uncle , in order that .
but he had not complete freedom of ideas . because he was in an agony of embarrassment . this agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the sister in law was sitting opposite to him . in a dress , specially put on , as he fancied , for his benefit . cut particularly open , in the shape of a trapeze , on her white bosom .
a ladder banged against the stones a few feet away . men swarmed up the rungs , fierce eyed clansmen with laughter in their mouths . stark was first at the head , they had given him a spear . he spitted two men through with it and lost it . and a third man came leaping over the parapet , stark received him into his arms , [male] watched .
he was in high good spirits about his patient . her eyes were the better instead of the worse for the exertion to which he had subjected them on the previous day . the bracing air of ramsgate was all that was wanting to complete the success of the operation . mr. [male] had started objections . all turning on the question of expense , but with a daughter who was her own [female] .
[male] had overreached ibsen in [location] , because what it had never been possible to do with an ibsen play . have a run in [location] , they were now doing with [male] . at the same time the theâtre des ecaliers put on `` the link , '' the odean produced `` the secret of the guild , '' and the chat noir `` the kings of heaven , ''
but when the little maid asked the dwarf his master 's name . the dwarf answered rudely that he would not tell her . `` then i will ask your master himself , '' said the maid . but as she stepped towards the knight , the dwarf struck her with his whip . and the little maid , half angry and half frightened , hurried back to the queen , and told her how the dwarf had treated her .
thus encouraged she put her toes in the water . gripping mickey and waiting breathlessly to see what happened , nothing happened , while the warm . running water felt [female] , so she dipped lower . and then did her best to make it splash . it was not much of a splash , but it was a satisfying performance to the parties most interested .
the archdeacon had consulted the bishop , -- really troubled deeply about the matter . and the bishop had taken upon himself , with his own hands . to write words of mild remonstrance to the marquis . for the welfare of the parish generally , said the bishop , i venture to make this suggestion to your lordship . feeling sure that you will do anything that may not be unreasonable to promote the comfort of the parishioners .
fitzpiers duly arrived at hintock house . whose doors he now saw open for the first time . contrary to his expectation there was visible no sign of that confusion or alarm which a serious accident to the [male] of the abode would have occasioned . he was shown into a room at the top of the staircase . cosily and femininely draped , where , by the light of the shaded lamp , he saw a woman of full round figure reclining upon a couch in such a position as not to disturb a pile of magnificent hair on the crown of her head .
let other pens dwell on guilt and misery . i quit such odious subjects as soon as i can , impatient to restore everybody . not greatly in fault themselves , to tolerable comfort . and to have done with all the rest , it is true that [male] was very far from happy himself . he was suffering from disappointment and regret .
jup , ah , but what 's to become of olympus in the meantime , thes , [female] bless you , do not distress yourself about that . i have a very good company , used to take long parts on the shortest notice . invest [male] with your powers and we will fill your places till you return , thes , fail . oh , we never fail in our profession , we have nothing but great successes , jup .
[male] had had a bad morning : the bronchial symptoms which had developed a day or two before had greatly increased her distress . and there had been , at dawn , a moment of weakness when it seemed that some pitiful power was about to defeat the relentless efforts of science . but wyant had fought off the peril , by the prompt and audacious use of stimulants . by a rapid marshalling of resources , a display of self reliance and authority . which [female] could not but admire as she mechanically seconded his efforts .
bannon did not have to wait long , soon there was a sound of feet outside the door . and after a little hesitation , six laborers entered , five of them awkwardly and timidly . wondering what was to come , [male] followed , with [organization] , and closed the door . the members of the committee stood in a straggling row at the railing . looking at each other and at the floor and ceiling -- anywhere but at the boss .
judging by her hair , her coloring . and the shape of her features , she was striking . if not actually beautiful , decision and composure stamped her . a combination of qualities that produced a very marked character . and one that was not calculated to put a young man , who scarcely knew her .
three days after the wedding mr. [male] 's carriage again stood before the door . when all was ready , [male] knelt down , and winding his arm around [male] . prayed in simple , touching language that god would protect his [male] . and at last bring them all to the same home , all of us . and do not let one be missing thar , there was a peculiar pathos in the tone of his voice as he said the last words .
in the mean time a stray personage of a meek demeanour . who had wandered to the hearthrug and got among the heads of tribes assembled there in conference with mr [male] . eliminated mr [male] 's flush and flourish by a highly unpolite remark . no less than a reference to the circumstance that some half dozen people had lately died in the streets , of starvation . it was clearly ill timed after dinner , it was not adapted to the cheek of the young person .
above the fireplace a massive dark oak chimney breast further emphasized the grand scale of the room . from every conceivable place—from shelves built for the purpose . from brackets that thrust out long arms among the books . from a great crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling . and from the breast of the chimney—innumerable candles blazed with dazzling brilliancy .
if so , she was the last woman in littlebath to interfere between him and that other one . but how was she to know that this was not some villainy on the part of mrs stumfold ? she felt sure , after what she had now seen and heard , that nothing in that way would be too bad for mrs stumfold to say or do . she never would go to mrs stumfold 's house again . that was a matter of course ; but what should she do about mr maguire ?
the next morning opened calmly , and [female] sat in her own room . her very own room , and consumed an egg and marmalade . and read the advertisements in the daily telegraph , then began expostulations . preluded by a telegram and headed by her aunt , the telegram reminded [female] that she had no place for interviews except her bed sitting room . and she sought her landlady and negotiated hastily for the use of the ground floor parlor .
mr [male] was very good-looking ; mr maguire was afflicted by a terrible squint . mr [female] 's mode of speaking was [female] to her . whereas she was by no means sure that she liked mr maguire 's speech . but mr maguire was by profession a gentleman . as the discreet young man , who is desirous of rising in the world .
but the comic when it is human becomes quickly painful , yes , she was infinitely anxious . and i was asking myself whether this poignant tension of her suspense depended . to put it plainly -- on hunger or love . the answer would have been of some interest to captain [female] . for my part , in the presence of a young girl i always become convinced that the dreams of sentiment .
here endeth the epistle : the elect salutes you . this week , if the authorities permit , i shall be paying you a flying visit . with wings full of eyes , -- and , i hope , healing ; for i believe you are seedy . and that that is what is behind it , you notice i have not complained . dearest , how could i , my happiness reaches to the clouds -- that is .
i tell you it was your doing . i tell you it was done through you , he retorted , catching up the gun , and making a blow with the stock at the vacant air between us . i come upon her from behind , as i come upon you to night , i giv ', it her ! i left her for dead , and if there had been a limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you .
grannie looked up at pete as he laughed . and the broad rose withered on his face , `` h 'm , h 'm ! '' he said , clearing his throat ; `` i am bad dreadful wanting a smook . '' and past the dinner table , now smoking and ready , he slithered out of the house . for three days pete bore himself according to his wont .
this invitation she accepted without much doubt . she would go and see mrs stumfold in her house . and would then be better able to decide whether the mode of life practised by the stumfold party would be to her taste . so she wrote a reply , and sent it by her maid servant . greatly doubting whether she was not wrong in writing her answer on common note paper , and whether she also should not have supplied herself with some form or card for the occasion .
even under the stars which crusted a moonless sky . the vast stretches of billowing sand glimmered faintly golden as a phosphorescent sea . and among the dimly gleaming waves of that endless waste the motor tossed . rocking on the rough track like a small boat in mid ocean , nowhere was there any sound except the throbbing of their machinery . and a fairy fiddling of unseen crickets , which seemed to make the silence more intense .
near the top a hoarse barking greeted him . up on the lawn above the fernery he could see his old dog balthasar . the animal , whose dim eyes took his master for a stranger . was warning the world against him , jolyon gave his special whistle . even at that distance of a hundred yards and more he could see the dawning recognition in the obese brown white body .
there were , in fact , so many things to be attended to , so many people to be pleased . so many best characters required , and , above all , such a need that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy . that there did seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and zeal could hold out . [female] looked on and listened , not unamused to observe the selfishness which , more or less disguised . seemed to govern them all , and wondering how it would end , for her own gratification she could have wished that something might be acted .
`` good , '' cried [female] , `` i will be there ten minutes before twelve . '' and he set off running as if the devil possessed him . hoping that he might yet find the stranger , whose slow pace could not have carried him far . [male] , hearing the musketeer swear . wished to escape from the cloak , which blinded him , and sought to find his way from under the folds of it .
gusts of splendour , gods and demigods contending with vast swords . colour and fragrance broadcast on the field of battle . magnificent victory , magnificent death , oh , it all burst before the girl . and she even stretched out her gloved hands as if it was tangible . any fate was titanic ; any contest desirable ; conqueror and conquered would alike be applauded by the angels of the utmost stars .
[female] violently ill , he lay down for a time . while the boys waited on him , and at last when he could slowly walk toward home . they went on , jud and [male] left them at the creek . and junior and mickey started up the harding lane . suddenly mickey sat down in a fence corner , leaned against the rails .
[female] paused for a moment under the vicarage windows . till she could sufficiently well hear the voices of the diners to be sure that they were actually within . and then went on her way , which was towards the rings hill column . she appeared a mere spot , hardly distinguishable from the grass . as she crossed the open ground , and soon became absorbed in the [female] mass of the fir plantation .
her slender arms , girlish rather than womanly in their beauty , were bare . her hair was bound up in shining coils about her head . with a single flower nestling amid a little cluster of curls that fell upon her neck . after his first movement , [male] recovered himself by a strong effort . he bowed low to conceal the flush in his face .
so said the doctor to himself , what was it to him . the bishop , or to him , the doctor . what mr. [male] had been doing in [male] ? the man 's scholarship was patent . his morals were unexceptional , his capacity for preaching undoubted , his peculiar fitness for his place at bowick unquestionable . who had a right to know more ? that the man had been properly educated at oxford .
she replied that , on the way there , she meant to stop a moment at her mother 's . and while she drew on her gloves . he fumbled among the knick-knacks on the mantel piece for a match to light his cigarette . she had sorted the papers -- she knew . then -- she must know -- and she had made no sign !
`` go to the devil , '' i bawled at him . and went down to my room and slammed the door in rage and chagrin . going to bed at three o clock on a winter morning in a house whose ways are disquieting . after a duel in which you escaped whole only by sheer good luck . does not fit one for sleep , when i finally drew the covers over me it was to lie and speculate upon the events of the night in connection with the history of the few weeks i had spent at glenarm .
lady gwendoline had promised to be the friend of [female] . and she kept her word . there was no bitterness in her heart now ; and perhaps she liked [female] 's widow all the better on account of that foolish wasted love that made a kind of link between them . so mrs. [female] was permitted to possess her new wealth in [female] . protected from any scandal by the ruysdale influence , she was permitted to be at [female] .
the turnkey went off the lock of this world next day . his words were remembered and repeated ; and tradition afterwards handed down from generation to generation . a marshalsea generation might be calculated as about three months . that the shabby old debtor with the soft manner and the white hair . was the father of the marshalsea , and he grew to be proud of the title .
the dear old man said no more , but pressed my hand -- his other hand upon my shoulder . `` go and see our old friend , '' he repeated presently , i went . taking care to avoid the familiar sitting room and to go only to the office . there her father sat , looking strangely worn and anxious , but he rose to greet me . he was pleased to see me , i could see that by the smile that brought something of the old look back upon his face .
meg danced and flirted , chattered and giggled , as the other girls did , after supper she undertook the german . and blundered through it , nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt . and romping in a way that scandalized laurie , who looked on and meditated a lecture . but he got no chance to deliver it . for meg kept away from him till he came to say good night .
he crept softly into the room , making a wide circle . and keeping himself completely in the shadow , till he was behind the sleeping baronet . then he came towards the lamp lit table , amongst the scattered letters and papers . there stood a claret jug , a large carafe of water . and an empty glass , [male] drew close to the table .
[female] already knew most of the [female] folks by sight . but at the foot of the hill he met two people . a man and a boy , whom he did not know . they were sitting in a shabby , old-fashioned wagon . and were watering their horse at the brook , which gurgled limpidly under the little plank bridge in the hollow .
he could find no words for what he wished to say . he rose , but attempted not to approach her , [female] leant against the wainscoat . still close to the bell , but without seeking to ring it , both were silent . his extreme youth , his visible inexperience , and her suspicious situation . joined to his quick repentance , and simple , but emphatic declaration .
d'artagnan listened with the greatest attention , biting his mustache to conceal his vexation . and the queens were not less interested , they were fatigued , and would have preferred to go to rest without proceeding any farther . more especially , in order to prevent the king walking about in the evening with [male] and the ladies of the court . for , if etiquette required the princesses to remain within their own rooms . the ladies of honor , as soon as they had performed the services required of them .
the week she had allowed herself had passed . and still there was no word from [female] , she allowed herself yet another day . and that too went by without a letter , she then decided on a step from which her pride had hitherto recoiled . she would call at the bank and ask for [female] 's address . she called , embarrassed and hesitating ; and was told , after enquiries in the post office department .
very little was said between [female] and miss [female] which did not refer to the game . but lady [female] , looking on , told herself that they were making love to each other before her eyes . and why should not they ? she asked herself that question in perfect good faith . why should they not be lovers ? was ever anything prettier than the girl in her country dress . active as a fawn and as graceful ? or could anything be more handsome , more attractive to a girl .
the wife did not leave her own room , the husband had not been at home for three days . the children ran wild all over the house ; the english governess quarreled with the housekeeper . and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her . the man cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time . the kitchen maid , and the coachman had given warning .
[male] knew of no reason why he should paste himself up against the church door . [male] would come out as usual , and he would join her as she went past the corner . this was what happened , [female] came down the steps , her stately figure outlined in its darkness against the gush of lamplight from the porch . [female] asked her if he might see her home . [male] took his arm calmly .
colonel osborne was on this committee . and , moreover , was on good terms at the colonial office . there were men in office who would be glad to do colonel osborne a service . and then if this were a job , it would be so very little of a job ! perhaps sir [male] might not be the very best man for the purpose .
it was in the warmest days of july . when in due course of time the saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at [male] morcerf 's . it was ten o'clock at night . the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count 's house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven . which was studded with golden stars , but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered .
since we can not get what we like , let [female] like what we can get , spanish proverb . while [male] , safely married and with the hospital under his command . felt himself struggling for medical reform against middlemarch . middlemarch was becoming more and more conscious of the national struggle for another kind of reform . by the time that lord [male] measure was being debated in [organization] .
had the whim for acquainting himself with it seized him in his own study . he would have satisfied it with a far more superficial interview . but the presence of the girl , with those eyes fixed on him as he read . his mind 's eye saw them . was for the moment an enlargement of his being , whose phase to himself was a consciousness of ignorance .
he hoped that imminent danger might be revealed to him . like those phosphoric lights of the [male] which show the sailors the altitude of the waves against which they have to struggle . but nothing approached , silence , that mortal enemy of restless hearts . and of ambitious minds , shrouded in the thickness of its gloom during the remainder of the night the future king of france . who lay there sheltered beneath his stolen crown , towards the morning a shadow .
and then dawn slanted dynamically across the deck and flung the shadows reeling into gray corners . the dew rose and turned to golden mist , thin as a dream . enveloping them until they seemed gossamer relics of the late night . infinitely transient and already fading , for a moment sea and sky were breathless . and dawn held a pink hand over the young mouth of life .
but had been debarred from doing so by the peculiar position in which mr. [male] was placed . he had felt that it would be impossible to speak to the father of his affection for the daughter without any allusion to the coming trial . and he did not know how such allusion could be made , thinking of this . he had at different times almost resolved not to call at hogglestock till the trial should be over . then he would go there , let the result of the trial have been what it might .
she ordered all the books that were praised in the foreign papers and reviews she received . and read them with that concentrated attention which is only given to what is read in seclusion . moreover , every subject that was of interest to vronsky . she studied in books and special journals . so that he often went straight to her with questions relating to agriculture or architecture .
with that , came her father , and stood beside the others . gazing upon her with still , cold eyes , expressing only a pale quiet , she bowed her face on her hands . and would not regard him , even if he were alive , her heart was past being moved . it was settled into stone , the universe was sunk in one of the dreams that haunt the sleep of death . and , if these were ghosts at all , they were ghosts walking in their sleep .
he had only known [male] as one who had been thoroughly disagreeable to himself . and who had persecuted his daughter throughout their married life , there had come no happiness . not even prosperity , -- through the marriage , his daughter had been forced to leave the man 's house . and had been forced also to leave her money behind her , then she had been driven abroad . fearing persecution , and had only dared to return when the man 's madness became so notorious as to annul his power of annoying her .
to get to croston heath , molly had to go down a narrow lane overshadowed by trees . with picturesque old cottages dotted here and there on the steep sandy banks ; and then there came a small wood . and then there was a brook to be crossed on a plank bridge , and up the steeper fields on the opposite side were cut steps in the turfy path . which ended , she was on croston heath . a wide stretching common skirted by labourers dwellings , past which a near road to hollingford lay .
`` why , [female] , what is the matter ? '' exclaimed the shepherd , sitting up . he could not see that the big fellow 's clothing was torn . that his hat was gone , and that he was dripping with perspiration . but he could hear his labored breathing , strong as he was . the young giant was nearly exhausted by the strain of his race over the mountains .
its beauty and its placidity mocked her . before them went the considines , he wore a long cassock that swept the grass . as they went , while gabrielle walked in silence at his side . never once in their journey did she look back , it struck mrs. [organization] for the first time how young she was . how very much younger and more supple than her husband , and yet they seemed to be happy .
books sure to be a delight to every boy and girl who becomes the proud possessor of any or all of them . a religious book with a world wide reputation , that has no equal anywhere , formerly published at a price many times higher than now asked . this book is offered , postpaid , in cloth at 30 cents . and in paper , 15 cents , a remarkable book with a remarkable sale . over 2,000,000 copies of this famous work have been sold , and yet the sale does not diminish .
he would land at [location] in the darkness . ascend the cliffs ; go straight to the old haunted house ; enter it easily by the help of the knotted cord . concealed beforehand in a crevice of the rocks . would find in the house his travelling bag containing provisions and dry clothing . there he could await his opportunity , he had information .
it would appear that he remained a long time in this attitude . no longer thinking , overwhelmed and passive beneath the hand of the demon . at length some strength returned to him . it occurred to him to take refuge in his tower beside his faithful quasimodo , he rose . and , as he was afraid , he took the lamp from the breviary to light his way .
a scream from the girls , a burst of hilarious laughter from their escorts . mingled with loud apologies from their seemingly mischievous host , filled up the interval of darkness which i had insisted should not be too soon curtailed . then the lights glowed as suddenly as they had gone out , and while the glare was fresh on every face . i stole a glance at miss glover to see if she had made good use of the opportunity just accorded for ridding herself of the jewel by dropping it into the caldron . if she had , both her troubles and mine were at an end .
he kissed her hand and left her to seek my lady and make his adieus . for no persuasion could keep him , leaving a note for sir [male] . he hurried away , to the great relief of treherne and the deep regret of [male] . who , however , lived in hopes of another trial later in the season . `` here comes [female] , mamma , safe and well , '' cried octavia an hour or two later .
it was a long while before levin could soothe his wife . at last he succeeded in calming her , only by confessing that a feeling of pity . in conjunction with the wine he had drunk . had been too much for him , that he had succumbed to [male] 's artful influence . and that he would avoid her , one thing he did with more sincerity confess to was that living so long in [location] .
deposited as a femme sole with her large trunks , and having to wait while a vehicle was being got from the large sized lantern called the railway inn . [female] felt that the dirty paint in the waiting room . the dusty decanter of flat water , and the texts in large letters calling on her to repent and be converted . were part of the dreary prospect opened by her family troubles . and she hurried away to the outer door looking toward the lane and fields .
she took the girl 's arm . and half led , half dragged her from the house . the convulsive pressure of her slight hand held her firmly as an iron vise could have held her . the fierce march wind banged to the door of the house . and left the two women standing outside it , the long , [female] road lay bleak and desolate before them .
but to do it on the spur of the moment like this was beyond him . claire was speaking again , she had paused for a while after her recent speech . in order to think of something else to say ; and during this pause had come to her mind certain excerpts from one of those admirable articles on love . by [organization] , which do so much to boost the reading public of [location] into the higher planes . she had read it that afternoon in the sunday paper .
i had flattered myself that the voice had become to some extent intelligible to me . its outburst of anger caused no doubt by my cowardly flight after the indian . then its recovered friendliness , which had induced me to return ; and finally its desire to be followed . now that it had led me to this place of shadow and profound silence and had ceased to speak and to lead . i could not help thinking that this was my goal , that i had been brought to this spot with a purpose .
at the spencers mrs. [female] made them miserable by saying something ill natured about everyone in avonlea . mr. [male] refused to give anything because the hall . when it had been built , twenty years before , had not been built on the site he recommended . mrs. [male] , who was the picture of health . took half an hour to detail all her aches and pains .
`` you see , '' said the young man , 'the marshal 's family living in the country at present . the marshal has given miss [female] one of the rooms in his house to use when she likes . do not you think you had better come up there , and let me bring miss [female] ? she signified her assent . and he unlocked a door and conducted her up a side staircase into a dwelling house above .
sometimes he had hopes of reaching the vessel . which the sea , by the reflux of its waves . had left almost dry , so that you could have walked round it on foot . but suddenly the billows , returning with fresh fury , shrouded it beneath mountains of water . which then lifted it upright upon its keel , the breakers at the same moment threw the unfortunate [male] far upon the beach .
when [female] was nearly seventy years old the old nurse who had lived with her her whole life died . people wondered then what she would do , she can not live all alone in that great house , ', they said . but she did live there alone six months , until spring . and people used to watch her evening lamp when it was put out . and the morning smoke from her kitchen chimney .
the fashion of the invitation , communicated through the husband . proved its motive , conscience wished to show him that she could receive cordially and with no misgivings as to the outcome . she probably wished also to assure him that from all possible charges . he was now absolved , these motives were all gracious , but , he admitted with a queer smile of suffering . their result was rather akin to cruelty , he decided that he must meet her in the same spirit and allow her to feel that .
it might mean so many things -- she could read into it so many harrowing alternatives of indifference and despair . of irony and tenderness , was he suffering tortures when he wrote it . or seeking only to inflict them upon her ? or did the words represent his actual feelings . no more and no less , and did he really intend her to understand that he considered it his duty to abide by the letter of their preposterous compact ? he had left her in wrath and indignation .
most of the streets seemed paved with large , flat gray blocks of a substance resembling highly polished stone . or a form of opaque glass , there were no sidewalks . but close up before the more pretentious of the houses , were small trees growing . the party proceeded quietly through this now deserted city , crossing a large tree-lined square . or park , that by the confluence of many streets seemed to mark its center .
for lorna had so won them all , by her kind and gentle ways . and her mode of hearkening to everybody 's trouble . and replying without words , as well as by her beauty , and simple [female] of all things . that i could almost wish sometimes the rest would leave her more to me . but mother could not do enough ; and annie almost worshipped her ; and even [female] could not keep her bitterness towards her .
puzzled by the boy 's attitude , bourke agitated his hair and wondered aloud how marcel would like it if his employers were informed of his peculations . this was no chance shot , and took the irishman between wind and water . and when , dismayed , he blustered , demanding to know what the boy meant by his damned impudence . marcel quietly advised him that one knew what one knew : if one read the english newspaper in the cafe . as marcel did , one could hardly fail to remark that [male] always came to [location] after some notable burglary had been committed in [location] .
below , lying in my bunk , i found myself unable to read . my mind was bent on returning to what had just occurred on deck , and , against my will . the most gruesome speculations kept suggesting themselves , and then came mr. [male] . he had slipped down the booby hatch into the big after room and thence through the hallway to my room . he entered noiselessly , on clumsy tiptoes .
the sky became overcast , rain began to fall , and there was a rush for the carts . in half an hour [female] was empty , and the people were splashing off on every side like the big drops of rain that were pelting down . [male] hired a brake that was going back to the north . and gathered up his friends from [male] , when these were seated , there was a rush of helpless and abandoned ones who were going in the same direction . young mothers with children , old men and old women .
alone , a man may console himself , or among a crowd of unconscious mortals . but it must be admitted that the position of [male] eames was severe . he had been invited down there to woo [male] , and the squire and [organization] had been asked to be present at the wooing . had it all gone well , nothing could have been nicer , he would have been the hero of the hour . and everybody would have sung for him his song of triumph .
vronsky and [female] waltzed several times round the room . after the first waltz [female] went to her mother . and she had hardly time to say a few words to countess nordston when vronsky came up again for the first quadrille . during the quadrille nothing of any significance was said : there was disjointed talk between them of the korsunskys . husband and wife , whom he described very amusingly .
[female] never finished the simile , for it could hardly have been a proper one . the affair thus happily settled , she was introduced by miss tilney to her father . and received by him with such ready , such solicitous politeness as recalled [female] 's information to her mind . and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on . to such anxious attention was the general 's civility carried , that not aware of her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house .
swithin lingered behind the rest of the congregation sufficiently long to see lady constantine . accompanied by her brother , the bishop , the bishop 's chaplain . mr. [male] , and several other clergy and ladies . enter to the grand luncheon by the door which admitted from the churchyard to the lawn of welland house . the whole group talking with a vivacity all the more intense , as it seemed .
the lanterns of that date resembled large red stars . hanging to ropes , and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider . these streets were not deserted , there could be descried piles of guns . moving bayonets , and troops bivouacking , no curious observer passed that limit . there circulation ceased , there the rabble ended and the army began .
[location] was a sort of moral pitch . which few could touch and not be defiled , miss [female] had been on the watch for the signs of deterioration in [female] 's character ever since her return home . but , excepting in a greater number of pretty and becoming articles of dress . there was no great change for the worse to be perceived , [female] had been `` in the world , '' had `` beheld the glare and glitter and dazzling display of [location] , ''
in execution of the resolution which he had formed during his cooler moments . prince [male] received cedric and athelstane with distinguished courtesy . and expressed his disappointment , without resentment , when the indisposition of rowena was alleged by the former as a reason for her not attending upon his gracious summons . cedric and athelstane were both dressed in the ancient saxon garb . which , although not unhandsome in itself , and in the present instance composed of costly materials .
after about an hour of this amusement , in the latter part of which job did not participate . the mutes by signs indicated that billali was waiting for an audience . [male] he was told to `` crawl up , '' which he did as awkwardly as usual . and announced that the dance was ready to begin if she and the white strangers would be pleased to attend . shortly afterwards we all rose , and , ayesha having thrown a dark cloak ( the same .
[female] subsequently learned that she had at one time officiated as art critic to a journal of the other world . but she appeared , in spite of this fact . to carry in her pocket none of the small change of admiration . suddenly , just after he had called her attention to a charming constable . she turned and looked at him as if he himself had been a picture .
he is the brains of the elsinore . he is the master strategist . there is more in directing a ship on the ocean than in standing watches and ordering men to pull and haul . they are pawns , and the two officers are pieces . with which captain west plays the game against sea , and wind .
armitage wheeled about sharply , and as his face came into the full light of the street lamps the stranger stared at him intently . armitage was fumbling in his pocket for a coin . but this impertinence caused him to change his mind . two policemen were walking slowly toward them , and armitage . annoyed by the whole incident , walked quickly away , he was not wholly at ease over the meeting .
for a month to dwell in a dungeon cell . growing thin and wizen in a solitary prison , is a poor look out for a soldier stout . who is longing for the rattle of a complicated battle -- for the rum - tum - tum of the military drum and the guns that go boom , boom ! scene gardens in castle adamant .
i beseech you to imagine mr. [male] looking round on this scene . in his ample white surplice that became him so well , with his powdered hair thrown back . his rich brown complexion , and his finely cut nostril and upper lip . for there was a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen countenance as there is in all human faces from which a generous soul beams out . and over all streamed the delicious june [male] through the old windows .
the effect was electric , a stir ran . like a ripple over water , across that froth of upturned human faces . and completest silence followed , in that great silence they looked at this slim young man . hatless , long wisps of his [male] hair fluttering in the breeze . his neckcloth in disorder , his face white .
this kind of rocks , which in the old sea dialect were called isoles . are , as we have said , strange places , the sea is alone there . she works her own will , no token of terrestrial life disturbs her . man is a terror to the sea . she is shy of his approach , and hides from him her deeds .
he , on the contrary , had that desire for revenge upon her which even the gentler stamp of man is apt to conceive towards one who . herself the object of his strong affection . daily and hourly repels and repays it with scorn and infidelity . he did love her truly ; she was the one living thing in all his bitter lonely life to whom his heart had gone out . true , he put pressure on her to marry him .
`` i should like that much better than poisoning hounds and trapping foxes . '' when they got to the meet , conclaves of men might be seen gathered together here and there . and in each conclave they were telling something new or something old as to the iniquities perpetrated at trumpeton wood . on that evening before dinner madame goesler was told by her hostess that [female] finn was expected on the following day . the communication was made quite as a matter of course .
this being provided , he grew very wise , and told [male] clearly and candidly that we were both very foolish . for he said that we were keeping lorna , at the risk not only of our stock . and the house above our heads , but also of our precious lives . and after all was she worth it , although so very beautiful ? upon which i told him . with indignation , that her beauty was the least part of her goodness .
one after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him . the king of [location] sends his wife to seek the great man 's mercy . the emperor of [male] considers it a favor that this man receives a daughter of the caesars into his bed . the pope , the guardian of all that the nations hold sacred . utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man .
the blind man sank down on his haunches . with his head thrown back , whilst he rolled his greenish eyes . lolled out his tongue , and rubbed his stomach with both hands as he uttered a kind of hollow yell like a famished dog . emma , filled with disgust , threw him over her shoulder a five franc piece . it was all her fortune , it seemed to her very fine thus to throw it away .
had he not said that he would be a brother to her . and was it not a brother 's part to go to a sister in affliction ? i knew that he would come , i was sure of it . he is so true , as to captain [female] 's not coming she said nothing . even to herself ; but she felt that she had been equally sure on that subject .
he felt that it was a change in a happy life . a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear of disarranging something . this man , who had passed through all manner of distresses . who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate . who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint , who , after having dragged the chain of the galleys .
place : and i myself have sometimes admired its quaint . overhanging , ornamented house fronts -- blackened , and wonderfully old , but one rarely notices what has been familiar throughout life . and now i was less struck by the beauty of the picturesque old town than by the muddiness of its pathways . and the mingled noises of murmuring looms , scolding women . and squabbling children , that came up from the alleys which lay between the high street and the avon .
and afterward an out and out materialistic world -- and the catholic church , i wonder where you will fit in . of one thing i am sure -- celtic you will live and celtic you will die . so if you do not use heaven as a continual referendum for your ideas you will find earth a continual recall to your ambitions . amory , i have discovered suddenly that i am an old man . like all old men , i have had dreams sometimes and i am going to tell you of them .
in this delightful spot the two warriors halted , and each , after his own fashion . proceeded to relieve his horse from saddle , bit , and rein . and permitted the animals to drink at the basin , ere they refreshed themselves from the fountain head . which arose under the vault , they then suffered the steeds to go loose . confident that their interest , as well as their domesticated habits , would prevent their straying from the pure water and fresh grass .
now this old gentleman -- so they called him . according to his money ; and i have seen many worse ones . more violent and less wealthy -- he must needs come away that time to spend the new year tide with us . not that he wanted to do it , but because my mother pressing . as mothers will do to a good bag of gold .
he hoped that this community of infirmity would awaken master florian 's interest in behalf of the condemned man . but , in the first place , we have already observed that master florian did not care to have his deafness noticed . in the next place , he was so hard of hearing that he did not catch a single word of what the clerk said to him . nevertheless , he wished to have the appearance of hearing . and replied , ah , ah , that is different ; i did not know that .
sue 's kind hostess now returned from church . and there was no more intimate conversation , jude left in the afternoon , hopelessly unhappy . but he had seen her , and sat with her . such intercourse as that would have to content him for the remainder of his life . the lesson of renunciation it was necessary and proper that he .
for a quarter of an hour or more they followed the spoor through thick reeds . till suddenly nahoon whistled very softly and touched hadden 's arm , he looked up . and there , about two hundred yards away , feeding on some higher ground among a patch if mimosa trees . were the buffaloes -- six of them -- an old bull with a splendid head . three cows , a heifer and a calf about four months old .
their business is to relieve the man of his money as soon as possible . they are experts at their business . the towns of [location] and saginaw alone in 1878 supported over fourteen hundred tough characters . block after block was devoted entirely to saloons . in a radius of three hundred feet from the famous old catacombs could be numbered forty saloons .
soon i should see [male] and hear his news . i felt sure he would be at [location] to meet the ship . when [male] makes up his mind to do a thing . he will crawl from under a falling sky to do it . as the laconia swept on , i hardly saw the glittering city on its vast prayer rug of green and gold .
they climbed up the other bank , following the track of the men and horses which had formed the king 's hunting party . until they stood on the edge of the dark forest . where the young leaves were fresh and sweetly green , the sun burst forth . and sucked up the mists along the meadow flats beside the river below them . and the water flashed and the birds sang .
away , and yet the dazzling creature looked at him from sky . from earth , from air ; looked at him with the most poignant kindness . yet always shook her head , she had answered his first letter by a kind little note . his second by a kinder and littler one , and his third , fourth , fifth , and sixth by no note at all . but by the kindest message that she was thinking about him a great deal .
`` he is the eldest son , '' he repeated more than once . when talking to me of his hope that guy would now settle permanently at beechwood . after myself , the head of the family . ', after [male] ! it was almost ridiculous to peer so far into the future as that , of all the happy faces i saw the day before the marriage . i think the happiest was mrs. [female] 's , as i met her coming out of guy 's room .
as i heard these words and realized that the final toast was to be delayed and that some few moments must yet elapse before the room would be cleared and an opportunity given me for obtaining what i needed for the famishing mother and child . i felt such impatience with the fact and so much anxiety as to the condition of those i had left behind me that i questioned whether it would not be better for me to return to them empty-handed than to leave them so long without the comfort of my presence . when the [female] of the scene again seized me and i found myself lingering to mark its conclusion with an avidity which can only be explained by my sudden and intense consciousness of what it all might mean to her whose witness i had thus inadvertently become . the careful lawyer began by quoting the injunction with which this letter had been put in his hands . 'when they are warm with food and wine .
how she got back to the house she hardly knew . nor did he , that evening they did not again speak to each other , and on the following morning there was no walk to the mountains . before dinner he drove himself back to [male] . and when he was taking his leave she shook hands with him with her usual [female] smile . the leger this year was to be run on the 14th september .
dutiful as a wife as she had been dutiful as a daughter . she bore with her husband when his feeble health made him a wearisome companion . she waited upon him when pain made him fretful . and her duties became little less arduous than those of a hospital nurse . when , at the bidding of the scotch physician who had been called in at edinburgh .
presently they came to the end of the grove . it stopped abruptly ; and there , a few yards before them . was the high road from risingham to shoreby , lying , at this point . between two even walls of forest , at the sight [male] paused . and as soon as he stopped running , he became aware of a confused noise .
but such memories are of no avail now , i write to say that after so much of active political life . i will at last retire , my friends when they see me inspecting a pigsty or picking a peach are apt to remind me that i can still stand on my legs . and with more of compliment than of kindness will argue therefore that i ought still to undertake active duties in parliament . i can select my own hours for pigs and peaches . and should i , through the dotage of age , make mistakes as to the breeding of the one or the flavour of the other .
i did his behest , the company all stared at me as i passed straight among them . i sought mr. [male] , delivered the message . and preceded him from the room : i ushered him into the library . and then i went upstairs , at a late hour , after i had been in bed some time . i heard the visitors repair to their chambers : i distinguished mr. [male] 's voice .
on the other hand , [female] was feeling more or less uncomfortable , there was an air of [female] and quiet respectability about the old house . a domestic odor of baking cake , a quietness and stability that somehow made his errand appear absurd . to connect it with [male] and his tumultuous past seemed ridiculous . when , hat in hand , he walked into [male] 's consulting room . he had made up his mind that he would pay the price of an overactive imagination for a prescription .
as to attempting to find nugent , no idea of doing this entered my mind . wherever he might be , at home or abroad , it would be equally useless to appeal to his honor again . it would be degrading myself to speak to him or to trust him . to expose him to lucilla the moment it became possible was the one thing to be done . i was ready with my letters , one enclosed in the other , when good mr. [male] called to drive me to brighton in his light cart .
why , if he were not wicked and abandoned , did he wear that jaunty look . that look which was so worldly ? and , moreover , he went to balls . and tempted others to do the like , in a word , he was a young man manifestly of that class which was esteemed by mrs. [female] more dangerous than roaring lions . it was not possible that she should give up her opinion merely because this roaring lion had come out to her mother with a plausible story . upon her at that moment fell the necessity of forming a judgment to which it would be necessary that she should hereafter abide .
for instance , a fireman is a brave fellow ! he fears nothing , least of all fire ! well , the fireman in question , who had gone to make a round of inspection in the cellars and who . it seems , had ventured a little farther than usual , suddenly reappeared on the stage . pale , scared , trembling , with his eyes starting out of his head .
mrs. [female] and her sister allowed it to be so . but still they admired her and liked her . and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they would not object to know more of . miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose . lady [male] was a very good kind of woman .
his confidence uplifted them again , the thing seemed as easy as he represented it . `` then let your passport be for four , my friend , '' madame begged him . `` there is [female] , '' she explained , indicating the footman who had just assisted them to alight . rougane departed confident of soon returning , leaving them to await him with the same confidence . but the hours succeeded one another , the night closed in , bedtime came .
there was not much time to be lost , luggage had to be packed , since it would not be safe for the three to return until at least two or three weeks had passed . and marjorie , besides , had to prepare a list of places and names that must be dealt with on their way . places where word must be left that the hunt was up again . and names of particular persons that were to be warned , mr. [male] and mr. [male] were in the county . and these must be specially informed , since they were known , and mr. [male] in particular had already suffered banishment and returned again .
they did , however , survive as a people , and some of the ancient saxon families possessed wealth and power . although they were exceptions to the humble condition of the race in general . it seemed to the author , that the existence of the two races in the same country . the vanquished distinguished by their plain , homely , blunt manners . and the free spirit infused by their ancient institutions and laws .
he was aghast at her calmness , the irregular lines in his face showed the disordered state of his soul . but she walked by his side without the quiver of an eyelid . or a tinge of colour more than usual , had she understood , `` look ! '' he said , and he drew pete 's telegram from his pocket and gave it to her . she opened it easily , and he watched her while she read it .
on quitting the cobb , they all went in doors with their new friends . and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many . [female] had a moment 's astonishment on the subject herself . but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville . to turn the actual space to the best account , to supply the deficiencies of lodging house furniture .
through the leaves , to the height of a foot or more above them . a slender dead stem protruded , and from a twig at its summit depended a broken spider 's web . a minute dead leaf had become attached to one of the loose threads and threw its small but distinct shadow on the platform leaves below . and as it trembled and swayed in the current of air , the [female] spot trembled with it or flew swiftly over the bright green surfaces . and was seldom at rest , now , as i sat looking down on the leaves and the small dancing shadow .
[male] was much affected at not meeting with [male] , his affectionate heart longed to take a farewell and received consolation from that heart of steel . [male] knew from experience that [male] became impenetrable when engaged in any serious affair . whether on his own account or on the service of the king . he even feared to offend his friend , or thwart him by too pressing inquiries . and yet when [male] commenced his labor of classing the flotilla .
summer was retreating , the wind roared , the trees groaned . yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven . the weather was breaking up , breaking , broken , and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery . mr. [male] 's eyes rested on windy corner . where [male] sat , practising [male] , no smile came to his lips .
in five minutes we were once more on our way through the vast ruined city . which loomed at [male] on either side in the grey dawning in a way that was at once grand and oppressive . just as the first [male] of the rising sun shot like a golden arrow athwart this storied desolation we gained the further gateway of the outer wall . and having given one more glance at the hoar and pillared majesty through which we had journeyed . and ( with the exception of job , for whom ruins had no charms ) .
by and by , his aunt spoke to him . and they kept up a little side conversation . more because bell [female] felt that her nephew . her own flesh and blood , was put out , than for any special interest they either of them felt in what they were saying . perhaps , also , they neither of them disliked showing that they had no great faith in the stories kinraid was telling .
again , he could see himself too powerful to offend , too dangerous to ignore . going out on his duties without cheer , and returning to his wife without company . finally , he remembered his father and his mother . and he could not help but picture himself sitting at home with [female] five years after their marriage . when the first happiness of each other 's society had faded , had staled , had turned to the wretchedness of starvation in its state of siege .
chapter iii , how a poor man riding upon a lean mare desired king [male] to make his son knight , chapter vi . how sir gawaine rode for to [male] again the [male] . and how two brethren fought each against other for the [male] , chapter vii how the [male] was chased into a castle and there slain . and how sir gawaine slew a lady , chapter viii . how four knights fought against gawaine and gaheris .
that was all , but the words were accompanied by a look and a pressure of the hand that brought the warm blood into clarissa 's cheeks . she had made for herself that worst enemy a woman can have . a disappointed lover , while they were shaking hands . mr. [male] came in sight at the other end of the walk . so it was only natural that mr. [male] .
[female] had become quite aware , without much process of thinking about it . that her former lover and this [female] young lady were very intimate with each other . the tone of the conversation had shewn that it was so . and , then , how had it come to pass that mr. [male] had spoken to this [female] girl about her , [female] rowley ? it was evident that he had spoken of her with warmth .
to leave them for unknown darkness , for the unimaginable state . for such nothingness that he would not even be conscious of wind stirring leaves above his grave . nor of the scent of earth and grass . of such nothingness that , however hard he might try to conceive it . he never could , and must still hover on the hope that he might see again those he loved !
the resolve adopted , he took up a taper and went off to bed . it was old [male] who brought the news next morning to the brothers as they were breaking their fast . [male] should have kept his bed that day . but dared not , lest the fact should arouse suspicion , he had a little fever . the natural result both of his wound and of his loss of blood .
was it not monstrous to have attached serious meaning to what oscar had said when he was in a panic of nervous terror ! his tone of writing so keenly distressed me that i resented his letter on that very account . it was one of the chilly evenings of an english june . a small fire was burning in the grate , i crumpled up the letter . and threw it , as i supposed , into the fire .
a month later [male] was left alone with his son in his house at petersburg . while [male] and vronsky had gone abroad , not having obtained a divorce . but having absolutely declined all idea of one , princess shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for the wedding to take place before lent . just five weeks off , since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time . but she could not but agree with levin that to fix it for after lent would be putting it off too late .
to complete every other recommendation , he had almost told her that he loved her . what strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to . was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration . a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion . joined to all the rest , made her think that she must be a little in love with him .
as for the general condition of the country , it was as it had been when i arrived in it . to all intents and purposes , i had made changes . but they were necessarily slight , and they were not noticeable , thus far , i had not even meddled with taxation . outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues . i had systematized those , and put the service on an effective and righteous basis .
for [female] had already described how he had seen the man go bounding along the mountain side . and he was now filled with amazement at what he heard from the goatherd . and more eager than ever to discover who the unhappy madman was ; and in his heart he resolved . as he had done before , to search for him all over the mountain . not leaving a corner or cave unexamined until he had found him .
directly after the doctor , who had taken up so much time , came the celebrated traveler . and [male] , by means of the pamphlet he had only just finished reading and his previous acquaintance with the subject . impressed the traveler by the depth of his knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his view of it . at the same time as the traveler there was announced a provincial marshal of nobility on a visit to petersburg . with whom [male] had to have some conversation , after his departure .
at any rate we waited there , and so i had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near mrs. pocket in their play . they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over her . always very much to her momentary astonishment , and their own more enduring lamentation , i was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance . and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it . until by and by millers came down with the baby , which baby was handed to flopson .
the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever commanded . towns fled from them like shadows on their path . and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them . and retreating as rapidly when once reached , the following morning they arrived at chalons . where the count 's steamboat waited for them .
as the rain and wind increased , and fancy 's bonnet ribbons leapt more and more snappishly against her chin . she paused on entering mellstock lane to consider her latitude . and the distance to a place of shelter . the nearest house was [female] , in higher mellstock . whose cottage and garden stood not far from the junction of that [female] with the road she followed .
they instantly quitted their prize , and rushed towards the door of the room . he was now returned to a sense of his danger . and endeavoured to escape to the exterior part of the ruin ; but terror bewildered his senses . and he mistook his way , instead of regaining the arch way . he perplexed himself with fruitless wanderings .
before the stars paled , [male] , who slept in an empty cart . waked and went about his work in silence ; it seemed at that hour unkind to rouse faiz ullah and the interpreter . his head being close to the ground , he did not hear [female] till she stood over him in the dingy old riding habit . her eyes still heavy with sleep , a cup of tea and a piece of toast in her hands . there was a baby on the ground , squirming on a piece of blanket .
`` that will do , take her away , '' cried [female] , who was sobbing in the alcove . then the symptoms ceased for a moment ; she seemed less agitated . and at every insignificant word , at every respiration a little more easy . he regained hope , at last , when canivet came in . he threw himself into his arms .
i entered the keeper 's lodge . and asked him if on the 22nd of february a woman named marguerite gautier had not been buried in the montmartre cemetery . he turned over the pages of a big book in which those who enter this last resting place are inscribed and numbered . and replied that on the 22nd of february , at 12 o'clock , a woman of that name had been buried . i asked him to show me the grave .
latterly , however , it would seem that a process of growth had been going on in him . three years had worked a difference , in some respects he was , thank heaven ! still the old [male] -- the old careless , reckless , aimless fellow . but in others he was metamorphosed , [male] , a handsome fellow himself and a slave to beauty . as he was careful to inform us -- susceptible in the highest degree to real loveliness .
in the evening in summer he took his little girl with him and led her to the cemetery . they came back at nightfall , when the only light left in the place was that in binet 's window . the voluptuousness of his grief was , however , incomplete , for he had no one near him to share it . and he paid visits to madame lefrancois to be able to speak of her . but the landlady only listened with half an ear , having troubles like himself .
he was quite sure now that he wished he had remained at basle . and that he had accepted [male] 's letter as final . he told himself again and again that he could not make her marry him if she chose to change her mind . what was he to say , and what was he to do when he got to granpere . a place which he almost wished that he had never seen in spite of those profitable linen buyings ?
there was a general call for the purse bearer , but he floated in silence . and was inexplicable , the purse bearer was not to be bullied into any sudden reading of the riddle . then there came on a general debate about money matters . in which the purse bearer did say a few words , but he said nothing as to the great question at issue . at last up got mr [male] , towards the close of the evening .
thus , -- and in the exaggeration of anguish , and the optical illusion of consternation . all that might have corrected and restrained this impression was effaced , and society , and the human race . and the universe were , henceforth , summed up in his eyes . in one simple and terrible feature , -- thus the penal laws . the thing judged , the force due to legislation .
gilbert left a brief note for [female] with the woman . a note begging his friend to come to him when he was next in [location] . and having done this , he paid no more visits to the temple . but waited patiently for mr. [male] 's coming , feeling very sure that his request would not be neglected . if anything could have intensified the gloom of his mind at this time it would have been the absence of that one friend .
it was a glorious ride , and [location] 's eyes danced with joy . her blood thrilled to the tireless effort of the grayish yellow pack of magnificent brutes ahead of her . she watched the muscular play of their backs and legs . the eager outreaching of their wolfish heads , and their half gaping jaws . and from them she looked to jan , there was no effort in his running .
i got out my box of wax matches . and they struck as merrily , there , in that awful place , as they could have done in a [location] drawing room . in a couple of minutes both the lamps were alight and revealed a curious scene . we were huddled together in a rocky chamber , some ten feet square . and scared enough we looked ; that is , except ayesha , who was standing calmly with her arms folded .
an epergne or centre piece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth . it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable . and , as i looked along the yellow expanse out of which i remember its seeming to grow . like a [female] fungus , i saw speckle legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it . and running out from it , as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community .
[male] tried to laugh a little and to say what a long time ago it was since then . but pete , being started , laughed uproariously , slapped his knee , and rattled on . and then me , woman , d 'ye mind me ? me , with the pig stye gate atop of my head for a fish board . yelling , mackerel , fine ladies .
and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave . she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch . ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag , as the foreman of a spinning mill . when he has set the hands to work , goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should . and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion .
from his wife 's account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings . easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding . much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him . and probably despised by him , mr elliot . raised by his marriage to great affluence , and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself .
but for all he might say and all that he might urge in his mind to the contrary . he did more or less understand what her outburst meant , he could not but know that it was the last outcry of a broken spirit . in his heart he realised then , if he had never clearly realised it before . that this proposed marriage was a thing hateful to his daughter . and his conscience pricked him sorely , and yet -- and yet -- it was but a woman 's fancy .
near nightfall they came upon three graustark shepherds and learned that ganlook could not be reached before the next afternoon . the tired , hungry travelers spent the night in a snug little valley through which a rivulet bounded onward to the river below . the supper was a scant one , the foragers having poor luck in the hunt for food . daybreak saw them on their way once more . hunger and dread had worn down beverly 's supply of good spirits .
the fate of the young heir had [male] the grooves greatly . and had taught many in those parts to feel that the world was coming to an end . they had not loved young [male] , for he had been haughty when among them . and there had been wrongs committed by the dissolute young squire . and grief had come from his misdoings upon more than one household .
it was many hours later that octavie drew the locket from her bosom and looked at edmond with a questioning appeal in her glance . some people are born with a vital and responsive energy , it not only enables them to keep abreast of the times . it qualifies them to furnish in their own personality a good bit of the motive power to the mad pace . they are fortunate beings , they do not need to apprehend the significance of things . they do not grow weary nor miss step , nor do they fall out of rank and sink by the wayside to be left contemplating the moving procession , ah !
new york was very near , the day had been cold and showery . but the sun was shining now , and the whole scene looked bright and gay . every one seemed in high spirits , as if the new world they were about to touch contained for them a certainty of elysium . it was such a delicious relief to arrive at the great lively yankee city . after the tedium of a ten day 's voyage .
and then both sides withdrew to repose themselves , to bury the dead , and to lay soft salves on the wounded . thus they passed the night , but on the morn they made ready again to do battle . at the end of this day also sir [male] and his party stood better . but for pity he withheld his knights . and suffered king [male] 's party to withdraw one side .
[female] , informed by [female] of these particulars . shed a torrent of grateful tears at the interest which she had thus unexpectedly excited . then , reviving into a vivacity which seemed to renew all the pleasure that she had experienced on the night of the play . she diligently employed herself in appropriating the attire which [female] supplied for the occasion . mrs maple , now , had no consolation but that the stay of lady [female] in the neighbourhood would be short .
it was half chamber and half garden . such an adjunct to a house as in our climate would give only an idea of cold . rheumatism , and a false romance , but under an italian sky . is a luxury daily to be enjoyed during most months of the year . here mr. [male] and caroline had passed many hours .
