they are simply wooden erections like a box . built in parts of the line where the snow is likely to drift . passing swiftly through them just now you catch glimmers of light through the crevices . presently , when the snow comes , these will be effectually closed up , snow will lie a hundred feet thick on either side . to the full height of the shed , and the train , as watched from the line .
we did not know why and our sympathies went entirely to the one who was struck . it was difficult not to interfere , we rather think that some of the seemingly extraordinary judgments of the high gods between mortals must be explained on the ground of a somewhat similar imperfect knowledge . they too see us , but they can not hear . time is required for sound to reach olympus . when we get into warfare they observe only the carnage and the turmoil .
so far [female] plan was not miscarrying , but he had a very great deal to do . and very little time in which to do it , and whereas the muscles of the other passengers were relaxed as the ship drew to her berth . [male] muscles were only more tensely tightened , he had expected to see mr . seven sachs on the quay , for in response to his telegram from queenstown the illustrious actor author had sent him an agreeable wireless message in full atlantic . the which had inspired [male] to obtain news by marconi both from [location] and [location] .
from the barn he brought a sack of tobacco and some brown papers . he had no intention of smoking . but this kind of cigarette was too completely identified with buck benson to be left out . lolling against the side of dexter , he poured tobacco from the sack into one of the papers . `` get me this way , '' he directed .
give her my very best love , auntie ; and say i shall look in and see her later in the day . yes , yes , i will be sure to tell her , but by the bye , [female] -- [ feeling in her dress pocket ] . i had almost forgotten -- i have something for you here . [ opening the parcel , ] well , i declare ! have you really saved them for me , aunt [female] , hedda !
it is puzzling , when you come to think of it . this estimate accorded by the general public to the litterateur . it stands to reason that the man who writes books . explaining everything and putting everybody right , must be himself an exceptionally clever man . else how could he do it , the thing is pure logic .
the kitchen was a mess , splattered eggs were over everything and broken glass . crockery and plaster covered the floor . table and counters , only one egg remained unbroken . that was the golden egg , [male] picked it up and shook it . there was a faint sensation of something moving inside the tough , metallic looking shell .
i knew that his gong had flung him out , too , and that he would be along with his gun as soon as he could jump into his clothes . when i judged that the time was ripe , i crept to the room next the nursery . glanced through the window , and saw the dim outline of the coachman in the yard below . standing at present arms and waiting for a chance , then i hopped into the nursery and fired . and in the same instant the coachman fired at the red flash of my gun .
if her hips are not too pronounced she can wear the long coat . shown in picture no , 39 , the v shaped vesture gives her a longer waist . and the long lines of the revers add to the length of her skirt . if her hips are too prominent , she should avoid having any tight fitting garments that bring the fact into relief . she should not wear the long coat , but she can effectively modify it to suit her needs .
after this exchange of civilities , during which monk had lost nothing of his circumspection . the supper , or what was to serve for one , had been laid upon a deal table . monk invited the comte [male] la fere to be seated at this table . and took his place opposite to him , a single dish of boiled fish . set before the two illustrious guests , was more tempting to hungry stomachs than to delicate palates .
celia , ah , it 's all very well . but since our queen banished iolanthe , fairy revels have not been what they were , leila . iolanthe was the life and soul of fairyland . why , she wrote all our songs and arranged all our dances ! we sing her songs and we trip her measures .
as for cats , they nearly equal human beings for vanity . i have known a cat get up and walk out of the room on a remark derogatory to her species being made by a visitor . while a neatly turned compliment will set them purring for an hour . i do like cats , they are so unconsciously amusing , there is such a comic dignity about them . such a `` how dare you , '' `` go away , do not touch me ''
if a parent rings him up on the telephone . he murmurs something courteous about a wrong number and then leaves the receiver off the hook . if a housemaster , swelling with some grievance or scheme of reform . bears down upon him upon the cricket field on a summer afternoon . he adroitly lures him under a tree where another housemaster is standing .
[female] wrote the declaration of independence . he sent it to one of the magazines . but it was returned as not available , so he used it in [organization] and afterward got it printed in the record . i saw the chair he wrote it in . it is a plain , old-fashioned wooden chair .
well , i was not going to have any of that sort of thing , by jove ! i would seen so many cases of fellows who had become perfect slaves to their valets . i remember poor old [male] fothergill telling me . with absolute tears in his eyes , poor chap ! one night at the club , that he had been compelled to give up a favourite pair of brown shoes simply because [male] .
but i could not persuade him , he said he had letters to write . and , if i would allow him , would remain in his room till dinner was ready . the dinner was more successful than i had hoped for , [location] gave [location] melon as a hors d'oeuvre . followed by sardines and a fowl , with potatoes and vegetable marrow . her cooking surprised me , i had warned young bute that it might be necessary to regard this dinner rather as a joke than as an evening meal .
the famous [male] foix , who commanded the french troops at the battle of [male] . took advantage of this foible of his army . he rode from rank to rank , calling his officers by name . and even some of his private men , recommending to them their country . their honor , and , above all , to shew what they could do for their mistresses .
i wanted to see him do more miracles ; and so , just for the pleasure of hearing him answer . i asked him about hertzegovina , and pariah , and unique . but he began to generalize then , and show distress , i saw that with [location] gone . he was a [male] shorn of his locks . he was as other men , this was a curious and interesting mystery .
[female] blushed , and pouted for a moment , then beckoned to little ugly , who disobligingly suggested that the grass would be wet . it so happened there was no dew , and [female] convinced her of the fact by running in the grass . and then presenting the sole of her shoe for her inspection . miss [female] , her ill chosen objection being vanquished , went for her bonnet . and we set forth , miss [female] 's arm in mine as a matter of course .
wearily he sighed , alas , human nature was a frail , incalculable phenomenon . how was it likely a young man with his fortune to make would regard a girl as rich and attractive as cynthia galbraith . especially if her brother chanced to be his best friend and all her family reached forth welcoming arms to him . from her childhood he had watched her virtues unfold and none of their potentialities had gone unobserved by the quiet little old man . through the beauty of his own soul he had been enabled to translate the beauties of another .
what was to be done ? evidently nothing ; only the constable ordered a whole barrel of ale to treat his posse and any one about tire town who chose to drink . and the barrel was rolled out on the grass , tapped , and for a half hour there was a great jollification . which was not exactly in honor of our wedding , but which afforded the greatest gratification to the constable . his retainers , and those who happened to gather to see what was going on . this ended , and the bill paid , the easton delegation got into their wagons and turned their horses heads towards home .
at all events , they encircled , and at times partially overshadowed . a mouth utterly unequalled , here were the most entirely even , and the most brilliantly white of all conceivable teeth . from between them , upon every proper occasion , issued a voice of surpassing clearness . melody , and strength , in the matter of eyes . also , my acquaintance was pre eminently endowed , either one of such a pair was worth a couple of the ordinary ocular organs .
the leader of the government accepted his grace 's amendment with pleasure . he considered it the brightest amendment his grace had made that week . the government , he said , was aware of the intimate relation in which his grace stood to the bottom end of a parallelogram and was prepared to respect it . lord rosebery spoke at some length , he considered the clause unfair to scotland . where the high state of morality rendered education unnecessary .
the british flooded the country with a counterfeit that was rather better looking than the genuine . so that by the time a man had paid six hundred dollar for a pair of boots . and the crooked bills had been picked out and others substituted , it made him feel that starting a republic was a mighty unpopular job . [male] was in command of the colonial forces . he went on looking for more regulars to kill , but soon ran up against [male] the surrenderer .
a boob like [female] would try to get funny about seeing her bedroom . but i take it casually , he was not casual afterward . the contentment of companionship was gone , and he was restless with desire to touch her hand . but whenever he turned toward her , the cigarette was in his way . it was a shield between them .
biggs 's boy , as i have said . came round the corner , he was evidently in a great hurry when he first dawned upon the vision . but , on catching sight of [male] and me . and montmorency , and the things , he eased up and stared . [male] and i frowned at him .
other victories followed on the sea , and [location] privateers had more fun than anybody . [male] was re elected , thus showing that his style of administration suited one and all . and the war was prosecuted at a great rate , it became a sort of fight with [location] . the latter being supported by english arms by land and sea . of course the americans would have preferred to fight england direct .
then the king he hunched the duke private -- i see him do it . and then he looked around and see the coffin , over in the corner on two chairs . so then him and the duke , with a hand across each other 's shoulder . and t'other hand to their eyes , walked slow and solemn over there . everybody dropping back to give them room .
he was the man who gave [male] the rat . he felt that , in the eyes of the brown household . he was solely responsible for [male] 's collapse . there was reproach even in the eyes of the housemaid who showed him out . in the drive he met [male] .
for many years a priest had not been seen in the country . and a magistrate could not marry : the consequence was natural ; men and woman joined themselves together as husband and wife . trusting to the vows and promises of each other , father charlevoix . a jesuit , at last travelled into those wild regions , found many of the simple . innocent inhabitants living in that manner ; with all of whom he found much fault .
a loud hammering on the door cut off his eloquence . the intermission was over , and the second round had begun , it was pitch dark in the stable now that i had blown out the candle . and there is something about a combination of noise and darkness which tries the nerves . if mine had remained steady , i should have ignored the hammering , from the sound . it appeared to be made by some wooden instrument -- a mallet from the carpenter 's shop i discovered later .
no wonder if gideon was moody . he had not the slightest wish to modify his present habits . but he would not stand on that , since the recall of mr bloomfield 's allowance would revolutionize them still more radically . he had not the least desire to acquaint himself with law . he had looked into it already , and it seemed not to repay attention .
the child ought to look on his mother as a fountain of natural fun and poetry . but how can he unless the fountain , like other fountains . is allowed to play ? what chance have any of these ancient arts and functions in a house so hideously topsy turvy . a house where the woman is out working and the man is not . and the child is forced by law to think his schoolmaster 's requirements more important than his mother 's ?
of course , it would never do to carry this series to its conclusion and if no reply is received to this last letter it might be well to call on the gentleman in his place of business . or , possibly , it might even be better to call off the engagement , `` none but the brave deserve the fair '' but there is also a line in one of byron 's poems which goes . i believe , `` here sleep the brave , '' edith dearest , i am sitting in my room gazing first at your dear picture and then out of my window at the eiffel tower which is the tallest structure in the world . being 984 feet high ( woolworth building 750 feet , [location] obelisk 555 feet .
and with that i left the old gentleman and walked blushing back to the office . i do not doubt for an instant the truth of the baron 's story . but somehow or other i feel that in writing it my reputation is in some measure at stake . note -- mr. [male] . upon request of the editor of the [location] gazette to write a few stories of adventure for his imp 's page .
before coming as companion to mrs. rastall retford eve had been governess to hildebrand , aged six . the son of a mrs. [organization] . it had been , on the whole , a comfortable situation . she had not liked mrs. [organization] . but hildebrand had been docile , and altogether life was quite smooth and pleasant until mrs. [organization] 's brother came for a visit .
[male] forged a bill of sale and sold his mother to an [location] cotton planter for a trifle over six hundred dollar . he did not want to commit this treachery , but luck threw the man in his way . and this saved him the necessity of going up country to hunt up a purchaser . with the added risk of having to answer a lot of questions . whereas this planter was so pleased with roxy that he asked next to none at all .
in the middle weights there were three competitors still in the running . allen , [male] , and a felsted man . they drew lots , and the bye fell to [male] . who put up an uninteresting three rounds with one of the soldiers , neither fatiguing himself very much . [male] , of felsted , proved a much tougher nut to crack than allen 's first opponent .
`` women are frightfully rummy , '' he said gloomily , [male] did not get into the soup all at once . weeks went by , and months , and still nothing happened . now and then he would come into the club with a kind of cloud on his shining morning face . and i would know that there had been doings in the home . but it was not till well on in the spring that he got the thunderbolt just where he had been asking for it .
why , there 's no money in that , it 's no better than the [organization] . no , no , pupkin senior , like so many lawyers , was practically a promoter . and he blew companies like bubbles . and when he was not in the maritime provinces he was in [location] and [location] raising money and floating loans . and when they had no money left in [location] he floated it in [location] .
it seemed that her father died two months after marriage . right in the midst of the mellow light of the honeymoon . before he had had time to drop the exstatic sweetness of courtship and newly-married bliss and come down into the ordinary . everyday , good and bad demeanors of men , and she had always lived with her mother ( who naturally worshipped and [female] before the memory of her lost husband ) . and three sentimental maiden aunts , and they had drawed all their knowledge of manhood from moore 's poems and [female] 's songs .
but the average man or boy writes daily in these great gaudy diaries of his soul . which we call penny dreadfuls , a plainer and better gospel than any of those iridescent ethical paradoxes that the fashionable change as often as their bonnets . it may be a very limited aim in morality to shoot a `` many faced and fickle traitor , '' but at least it is a better aim than to be a many faced and fickle traitor . which is a simple summary of a good many modern systems from mr. [male] 's downwards .
we endeavored unsuccessfully to induce her to believe that we were sober , and we explained that our course of conduct was what was always pursued on the stage . she said she did not care what was done on the stage . it was not going to be pursued in her house ; and that if her husband 's friends could not behave as gentlemen they had better stop away . the following morning we received a letter from a firm of solicitors in [female] 's inn with reference . so they put it , to the brutal and unprovoked assault committed by [location] on the previous afternoon upon the person of their client .
of old england , with herds of horses . steers and sheep , worth millions of dollar . these young men are not of the kind of whom the metropolitan ass writes as saying `` youbetcherlife , '' and calling everybody `` pardner. '' they are many of them college graduates . who can brand a wild maverick or furnish the easy gestures for a strauss waltz .
and then roscoe sherriff came down , and [male] pickering . who for days had been using all his resolution to struggle against the siren . suddenly found that there was no siren to struggle against , no sooner had the press agent appeared than claire deserted him shamelessly and absolutely . she walked with roscoe sherriff . mr pickering experienced the discomfiting emotions of the man who pushes violently against an abruptly yielding door .
and , i added -- to myself , not in the note -- i will give him such a licking that he will brain himself with a cleek . for i was not pleased with the professor , i was conscious of a malicious joy at the prospect of snatching the prize from him . i knew he had set his heart on winning the tournament this year . to be runner up two years in succession stimulates the desire for first place . it would be doubly bitter to him to be beaten by a newcomer .
its name , or rather its qualification , is traced back to the remotest antiquity . the ancients called it kalonese , from two greek words . signifying beautiful isle , thus , at a distance of eighteen hundred years . it had borne , in another idiom , the same name it still bears . there was , then , something in itself in this property of m. fouquet 's .
one looked to see the cause of this disaster : one discovered it at once in the person of a mongrel terrier with pointed ears and a squirrel 's tail . the landlord rushed out from another door , and attempted to kick him out of the room . instead , he kicked one of the pigs , the fatter of the two . it was a vigorous , well planted kick , and the pig got the whole of it . none of it was wasted , one felt sorry for the poor animal .
his treatment of adair 's next over was freer . he had got a sight of the ball now . half-way through the over a beautiful square cut forced a passage through the crowd by the pavilion . and dashed up against the rails , he drove the sixth ball past cover for three . the crowd was now reluctantly dispersing to its own games , but it stopped as mr .
but the persons to whom i spoke could not understand me , and when they answered i could not understand them . so we did not make much headway by that , i could not get out of that asylum until i had surrendered the covers of our ticket books and claimed our baggage and put it through the customs office . i knew that ; the trouble was i could not find the place for attending to these details . on a chance i tried a door . but it was distinctly the wrong place ; and an elderly female on duty there got me out by employing the universal language known of all peoples .
during the progress of this conversation georgie merriles had been lounging on the couch by the window . reading the `` merchant of [location] '' in a critically unimpassioned way that the instructor in dramatic theory could not have praised too much . the room finally having become too dark for reading , she threw down the book with something like a yawn . `` it would have been a joke on portia , '' she remarked , if bassanio had chosen the wrong casket ', .
it seemed to want a lot of carving , i struggled with it for about five minutes without making the slightest impression . and then [female] , who had been eating potatoes , wanted to know if it would not be better for some one to do the job that understood carving . i took no notice of his foolish remark , but attacked the bird again . and so vigorously this time that the animal left the dish and took refuge in the fender . i was too exhausted to argue , i laid down the knife and fork with dignity and took a side seat and [male] went for the wretched creature .
all that has been written on the subject from time to time seems to me to be quite devoid of common sense . we all know what a delightful poet mr. [male] is . and how fondly he sings the praises of women . probably he has been so engrossed in describing the grace of the girl that he has failed to look for the natural elegance of the boy . possibly no artist admires the female form more than i do .
on all such subjects there is no science , but only a sort of ardent ignorance . and nobody has ever been able to offer any theories of moral heredity which justified themselves in the only scientific sense . that is that one could calculate on them beforehand , there are six cases , say , of a grandson having the same twitch of mouth or vice of character as his grandfather . or perhaps there are sixteen cases , or perhaps sixty , but there are not two cases . there is not one case , there are no cases at all , of anybody betting half a crown that the grandfather will have a grandson with the twitch or the vice .
this sounded enchanting , and nancy eagerly prepared herself to listen , such a story was then poured out that it held her spell bound . goblins , elves , and fairies . underground glories , thrilling adventures and escapes . was it any wonder that with such a gift for story telling teddy was the king of the village ? it came to an end at last , and nancy drew a long breath of relief and content when she heard the concluding sentence .
clematis frowned and sneezed as the infinitesimal particles of sachet powder settled in the lining of his nose . he became serious , and was conscious of a growing feeling of dislike . he began to be upset over the whole matter , but his conscience compelled him to persist in his attempt to solve the mystery . and also he remembered that one should be courteous , no matter what some other thing chooses to be . hence he sought to place his nose in contact with flopit 's .
the door was shut , and two fierce looking fellows stood on guard outside it . one of them with a key stuck in his belt . had we been alone , it would not have been long before it would have been in my hand . but with his comrade there it was impossible for me to hope to take it by force . the cell next door to the magazine on the far side from the chapel must be the one which belonged to sister angela .
`` and i am just as sure that i did not , '' returned jenkins . still perfectly undisturbed , while gooding , as might be supposed , felt his indignation just ready to boil over . but the latter controlled himself as best he could ; and as soon as he could get away from the store of jenkins . without doing so in a manner that would tend to close all intercourse between them . he left and returned to his own place of business .
eilert lovborg enters from the [male] . he is slim and lean ; of the same age as tesman . but looks older and somewhat worn-out , his hair and beard are of a blackish brown . his face long and pale , but with patches of colour on the cheeks . he is dressed in a well cut black visiting suit , quite new .
i began at once to construct a story for their especial benefit . the scene was to be a country residence on a rainy day . and the actors two little boys who should become uproariously jolly in spite of the weather . like most people not used to story making , my progress was not very rapid ; in fact . i had got no farther than the plot indicated above when an angry snarl came from the children 's room .
he is sure to be unfortunate in either decision , if he wears his light suit and takes the stick it comes on to rain . and he reaches the house in a damp and muddy condition and spends the evening trying to hide his boots . if , on the other hand , he decides in favor of the top hat and umbrella . nobody would ever dream of going out in a top hat without an umbrella . it would be like letting baby toddle out without its nurse .
the palace -- or the château , as it is modestly named . stands crosswise upon an elevation that dominates the scene for miles around . the whole building throughout is only of three stories , for french architecture has a horror of high buildings . the two great wings of the château reach sideways . north and south ; and one , a shorter one , runs westwards towards the rear .
here i have mentioned mr. [male] himself . saying how uncomfortable he felt upon the occasion of mr. [male] 's visit to his house for the purpose of obtaining a sitting . but i should add that the genial artist who was to do the work informed me that he also was no less ill at ease . when mr. [male] enquired how he should sit for the portrait . mr. [male] , anxious no doubt to secure a natural pose .
she heard the news at the noon hour on monday . and after her dinner she hurried at once to the store of fred farnsworth . to him she roundly declared that mr. [male] was a brute . a view of the man which struck fred as a bit highly colored . fred was thirty one or thirty two years old , a sensible , humorous fellow , with considerable personal force .
[male] longed for an opportunity of starting with [male] . and walking with him to the station , but no such opportunity came in her way . it was his custom always to go up to his father before he left home . and on this occasion [male] did not see him after he quitted the breakfast table . when the clatter of the knives and cups was over .
`` jackson , '' `` cicotte '' and the other names written upon them . when the dutch ruether disk was suddenly moved from the plate around to third base to indicate a triple . there were wild cheers from the crowd and they began to howl for a change in pitchers . `` take him out , '' they cried , appealing to a manager who did not even have so much as a disk to represent him . there was some more mad scurrying around the bases by the red disks , and then suddenly a large hand .
i can not just now remember when or where i first made the acquaintance of that truly fine looking fellow . brevet brigadier general person , person . some one did introduce me to the gentleman , i am sure -- at some public meeting . i know very well -- held about something of great importance . no doubt -- at some place or other , i feel convinced .
there are a few houses round the railway , and many more dotted over the plain and the slopes of the hills . but of a town , mediaeval or otherwise , not the slightest sign . he must take what is suitably termed a `` legno '' -- a piece of wood . and drive up eight miles of excellent road into the middle ages . for it is impossible , as well as sacrilegious , to be as quick as [male] .
and then of a sudden he stopped his chanting and drew closer to the window pane . the door of the shed still stood ajar as it had been left . and the minutes were slipping by , they were long minutes . but they slipped by nevertheless , he watched the starlings running and flying in little parties across the lawn . he counted them over and over again , with one eye always on that swinging door .
to be happy with a man you must understand him a lot and love him a little . to be happy with a woman you must love her a lot and not try to understand her at all . a man with savoir faire may scintillate in a crowd . but it takes a `` bashful man '' to shine in a dim cozy corner . every bride fancies that she married the original `` cave man '' until she tries to persuade him to go out and argue with the furniture movers .
i suppose that i have already said enough to have written myself down a temperance fanatic . a thin blooded cocoa drinker , and a number of other things equally contemptible . which is all very embarrassing to a man who is composing at the moment on port . and who gets entangled in the skin of cocoa whenever he tries to approach it . but if anything could make me take kindly to cocoa , it would be the sentimental rubbish which is written about the `` manliness '' of drinking alcohol .
the conundrum was unanswerable , baxter did not attempt to answer it . but there remained at the back of his mind a [male] idea that he had caught sight . as he woke , of the honorable [male] threepwood . his face warningly contorted , vanishing through the doorway , yet what could the honorable freddie be doing at the [male] arms ? a solution of the difficulty occurred to him .
but i leave this to the thinking mind . let the thinking mind grapple with it . it has no charms for me . moreover , i have not that kind of a mind . octher , another norwegian gentleman , sailed around north cape and crossed the arctic circle in 890 a. d. .
the social divisions in the county healed themselves after their own fashion . both parties found common ground in condemning the baroness 's outrageously bad taste and tactlessness . she has been fortunate in sub letting for the greater part of her seven years ', lease . [male] sat at his ease . an ease alike of body and soul .
after having heard for so many years the reminiscences of my good friend about the old gang . it seemed almost incredible that one of them should step into actual living being before my eyes . yet so it happened , i found mr. [male] at the club one day . about to lunch there , a thing contrary to his wont . and with him was a friend , a sallow .
mr smith proved more complaisant , and a quarter of an hour after dunstable and [male] had disappeared . [male] and his friend were on the water . moist outside , [male] burned with a desire for revenge . he meant to follow his men till he found them . it almost seemed as if there would be a repetition of the naval battle which had caused the town to be put out of bounds .
oxygen , which was the principle of combustion . and the vehicle of heat , was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life . and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature , nitrogen , on the contrary . was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame , an unnatural excess of oxygen would result . it had been ascertained in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced .
these periodic flip-flops of the social pie are called revolutions . you would think that a revolving pie would be a disturbing thing to have in one 's system . but the giddy globe does not seem to mind it in the least , the latest specimen of acrobatic pastry is after a russian recipe . oh , very well , we never did care much for pie anyway , not even for breakfast . in spite of incessant and violent exercise .
yes , i have neighbored with about all sorts of religius believers . and never disputed that they had a right to their own religion . and i have seen them too that did not make a practice of goin to any meetin houses much , who lived so near to god and his angels that they felt the touch of angel hands on their forwards every day of their lives . and you could see the glow of the fairer land in their rapt eyes .
sedleigh had gone on to the field that morning a depressed side . it was unfortunate that adair had won the toss . he had had no choice but to take first innings . the weather had been bad for the last week , and the wicket was slow and treacherous . it was likely to get worse during the day , so adair had chosen to bat first .
[female] was now launched upon the ocean of theatrical suns and storms . with nature for his guide and everlasting glory for his name . shakspere had now his foot firmly planted on the lower round of the ladder of fame . whose top leaned against the skies of immortality , the fermentation of composition began again to work within his seething brain . and the daily demands of the blackfriars spurred him on to emulate if not surpass kyd .
there are many aged portraits -- some valuable , some worthless ; some of great interest . some of none at all , i bought a couple -- one a gorgeous duke of the olden time . and the other a comely blue eyed damsel , a princess , maybe , i bought them to start a portrait gallery of my ancestors with . i paid a dollar and a half for the duke and a half for the princess . one can lay in ancestors at even cheaper rates than these , in [location] .
`` is not it lovely ? '' said mrs. [female] . she was still talking about it as she climbed into the trap which was to take [location] to the station . `` one moment , '' i said , `` i have forgotten something . '' i dashed into the house and out by a side door . and then sprinted for the plantation , i took the nest from the weeping and over weighted ash and put it carefully back in the hedge by the tennis lawn .
`` by all means , '' replied van dam , 2 . a profound study of the metropolitan elephant . by surveying him in all his majesty of proportion . by tracing him to his secret haunts , and observing his habits . both in his wild and domestic state , 1 , in the meetings of the club .
lady underhill , having said all she had to say . recovered her breath and began to say it again , frequent iteration was one of her strongest weapons . as her brother [female] , who was fond of homely imagery . had often observed , she could talk the hind leg off a donkey . derek shifted uneasily , there was a part of his mind which called upon him to rise up and challenge the outrageous phrase and demand that it be taken back .
perhaps this may have been largely due to my ignorance of his habits , possibly if i had been more familiar with his eccentricities . it would have been all right ; but as it was . there was no book of instructions given with him . and i could not seem to make him work , during the week following . the prospect shaft of the new jerusalem mine struck a subterranean gulf stream and water logged the stock .
the poets and other gentlemen who have written so much romantic nonsense about `` good red wine '' and `` good brown ale '' are responsible for this , i admit that a glass of burgundy is a more beautiful thing than a blancmange . but i do not think that it follows that a surfeit of one is more heroic than a surfeit of the other . there may be a divinity in the grape which excuses excess . but if so , one would expect it to be there even before the grape had been trodden on by somebody else .
as he spoke a man came towards them . and , with a shock that sent all the blood in his body to the very summit of his head . and then to the very extremities of his boots , [location] recognized mr seymour . the assurance of the programme that the play was by [male] was a fraud . nay worse , a downright and culpable lie .
`` it was roses , roses all the way . '' diva had quite miscalculated the number required , and there were sufficient not only to cover collar . cuffs and border of the skirt with them but to make another line of them six inches above the hem . original and gorgeous as the dress would be , it was yet a sort of parody of [female] 's costume which was attracting so much interest and attention as she popped in and out of shops today . tomorrow that would be worn by [female] , and [female] should encourage her friends to get permission to use up old bits of chintz .
so that is all of undue importance which happens on our second day , also in that time i has learned much . when i reflects back on how sorghum green i was when we landed here off the steam cars . i actually feels right sorry for myself . not knowing what a road house was , and figuring that when somebody mentioned sub let apartments they was describing the name of a family . and getting lost in harlem the first time i went forth rambling .
i praise that actor 's performance . i can only recall one instance of my departing from my principles . that was when the champagne was corked , and the man refused to buy me another bottle . as is only natural , i have met many interesting people since i embarked on my career . i remember once lunching with rare [female] at the mermaid tavern .
also it was herr wagner 's idea that the back cloth would leave the opera goer indifferent to the picture gallery . the castle on the rock , accessible only by balloon . in which every window lights up simultaneously and instantaneously , one minute after sunset , while the full moon is rushing up the sky at the pace of a champion comet . that wonderful sea that suddenly opens and swallows up the ship -- those snow clad mountains . over which the shadow of the hero passes like a threatening cloud .
whenever the horse stopped , he fell off in front . and whenever it went on again , he fell off behind , otherwise he kept on pretty well . except that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways . and as he generally did this on the side on which alice was walking . she soon found that it was the best plan not to walk quite close to the horse .
the next day i left harmony and walked to port jarvis . on the erie railroad , person , arriving late at night . and entirely footsore , sick , and disheartened , i went to the hotel , and the next morning i found myself seriously sick . asking advice , i was directed to the house of a widow . who promised to nurse and take care of me , i was ill for two weeks .
both those letters gave her pleasure . and both she answered , to all mrs. [female] enquiries she gave very full replies , and enjoyed her jokes with her old friend . she hinted that she did not at all intend to hurry the men atjames square , and that certainly she would be found in [male] court till the men had completed their work .
he told me a great deal about worms . and the kangaroo , and other coleoptera , and said he knew the history and ways of all such pachydermata . he said the kangaroo had pockets . and carried its young in them when it could not get apples . and he said that the emu was as big as an ostrich .
page yes , sir , [male] is mr. [male] there ? page he 's in the tent . sir -- refreshing , [male] ask him to be so good as to step this way . page yes , sir , aline oh , but , [male] , a real sorcerer ! oh , i shall be frightened to death , [female] i trust my aline will not yield to fear while the strong right arm of her [female] is here to protect her .
but not so with art , the brush may still deal freely with any subject . however revolting or indelicate , it makes a body ooze sarcasm at every pore . to go about rome and person and see what this last generation has been doing with the statues . these works , which had stood in innocent nakedness for ages . are all fig leaved now , yes , every one of them , nobody noticed their nakedness before , perhaps .
if he had been detected -- as he must have been in another instant . in smuggling pudding in an envelope he might have incautiously betrayed his real motives . and then , as the doctor was morbidly sensitive concerning all complaints of the fare he provided . he would have got into worse trouble than [organization] . to say nothing of the humiliation of being detected in such an act .
i wish there may not be something treacherous in this sudden reconciliation of fortune . i have no merit -- i have no title to such felicity . far from enjoying the prospect that lies before me , my mind is harrassed with a continued tumult . made up of hopes and wishes , doubts and apprehensions . i can neither eat nor sleep , and my spirits are in perpetual flutter .
i told him to go and hang himself . with so much vigour that he all but fell overboard , he was saved by a poultry crate . i had no luck that day . at ryde the guard , by superhuman effort , contrived to keep [location] a carriage to ourselves . i gave him a shilling .
under [female] 's direction , a crew of technicians ran a power line into the slightly wrecked chicken house . there were loud squawks of indignation from the sleeping hens as the men threaded their way through the nests . the line was installed and the power applied , a one hundred fifty watt bulb illuminated the interior of the chicken house to the discordant clucking and cackling of the puzzled birds . [male] , the big rooster , was perched on a crossbeam . head tucked under his wing , when the light flooded the shed he jerked awake and fastened a startled and unblinking stare at the strange sun .
the thing that the stage sailor most craves in this life is that somebody should shiver his timbers . `` shiver my timbers , '' is the request he makes to every one he meets . but nobody ever does it , his chief desire with regard to the other people in the play is that they should `` belay there , avast ! '' we do not know how this is done ; but the stage sailor is a good and kindly man . and we feel convinced he would not recommend the exercise if it were not conducive to piety and health .
but the position i hold in this chair requires that i shall not permit you to deceive and mislead the public with your plausible figures of speech . i know a female baby , aged eighteen months . in this city , which can not hold out as a `` joy '' twenty-four hours on a stretch . let alone `` forever , '' and it possesses some of the most remarkable eccentricities of character and appetite that have ever fallen under my notice . i will set down here a statement of this infant 's operations ( conceived , planned .
`` well , s'long , '' said [male] , as he opened the kitchen door . keep the ome fires burnin ' , and with that he was gone . [male] had learned from past experience that the more dramatic his exit the less likelihood there was of mrs. [female] scoring the final dialectical point . she was just in time to see [female] disappear round the corner . without a moment 's hesitation she followed .
horatio opened the hand box , there was a well worn hat in it . two pairs of cotton stockings . and three pairs of gloves -- that , somehow or other , had lost the ends of the fingers . and there was , moreover , a very nice pair of yellow [location] slippers , nearly new . horatio turned over these things some time .
i put you under milligan to get a view of you through his eyes . if he says that you are good enough to be a billing clerk . and to draw twelve dollar a week , i guess there 's no doubt about it . for he 's one of those men that never show any real enthusiasm except when they are cussing . naturally , it 's a great satisfaction to see a streak or two of business ability beginning to show under the knife .
so the voyager in pursuit of the marvellous , declines to state how high the thermometer rose or fell in the sun or in the shade . or whether the wind was east by north , or sou' sou' west by a little sou ' , the `` dew on the grass '' was not shining , for there was in his vicinity no dew and no grass . nor anything resembling those rural luxuries , nor was it by any means at early dawn . on the contrary , if there be such a commodity in a city as dawn ,
i went to see hamlet , thinking that i would be welcome , for my sympathies were with [male] when i heard that mr. [male] was picking on him and seeking to injure him . i went to the box office and explained who i was . and stated that i had been detailed to come and see mr. [male] act . also that in what i might say afterwards my instructions were to give it to abbey and [male] if i found that they had tampered with the audience in any way . `` walk in , '' said he , taking in dollar 2 and giving back 50 cents in change to a man with a dead cat in his overcoat pocket .
the life belts were thrown over , the powerful electric search lights were thrown upon the waters . these life belts as soon as they strike the water begin to [female] a bright red light . the poor old actor came up for the last time -- and just between the two life belts with their red fires burning . at the same moment the dazzling stream of light from the search light fell full upon him . the old man opened his eyes ; and a look of ineffable joy came over his face .
mr. [male] , of course . attended the morning school , indeed , as the matutinal performances were altogether classical . it was impossible that much should be done without him , on this saturday morning . however , he was not present ; and a few minutes after the proper time . the mathematical master took his place , `` i saw him coming across out of his own door , ''
that same evening she wrote a letter to her lawyer . telling him that she was very anxious to oblige her brother . if the security was good , and then she went into the matter at length . repeating much of what mr [male] had said to her , as to the excellence of mortgages in general . and of this mortgage in particular , after that she dressed herself with great care .
things ran along , a tournament nearly every week . and now and then the boys used to want me to take a hand . i mean sir [male] and the rest -- but i said i would by and by . no hurry yet , and too much government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a going . we had one tournament which was continued from day to day during more than a week .
after doubting much , she had determined to give the world a trial . and , feeling that [location] was too big for her , had resolved upon littlebath . but now , having started herself upon her journey , she felt as some mariner might who had put himself out alone to sea in a small boat . with courage enough for the attempt . but without that sort of courage which would make the attempt itself delightful .
it would be far better for parliament if its doors were shut again . and reporters were excluded , in that case , the outer public did hear genuine rumours of almost gigantic eloquence . such as that which has perpetuated pitt 's reply against the charge of youth . or fox 's bludgeoning of the idea of war as a compromise . it would be much better to follow the old fashion and let in no reporters at all than to follow the new fashion and select the stupidest reporters you can find .
when all of a sudden -- slam , bang , rush ! roar , slam , slam , ding , dong , bang , , ! come right over our heads the wild , deafening clamor of the bells . [male] started up wilder than ever because of his momentary repose . he never knew us , nor anything . from that time on , and after [male] for another 24 hours , [male]
probably pair very rare an valuable signs , probably come in handy , [male] removed the left hand sign from the door and endeavored to conceal it about his person . the sign being of considerable proportions , this was a matter of some difficulty . an idea flung itself at him . and with an air of dignified mystery he turned his back . after an instant he wheeled dramatically around , and stretching out his arms displayed himself to the admiring dean .
before the days of modern railroads one could not very well travel over night but now . thanks to mr. [male] , it is possible for the traveller to go to bed en route and be every bit as snug and comfortable as the proverbial insect in a rug . shortly after dinner the porter will `` make up '' the berths in the car and when you desire to retire for the night you should ask him to bring you the ladder in order that you may ascend to upper 9 . while you are waiting you should stand in the aisle and remove your coat . vest and shoes , and then begin to search for your suitcase which you will finally locate by crawling on your chin and stomach under berth number 11 .
the economy used by the early [location] warriors by land and sea regarding their ammunition . holding their fire until the enemy was at arm 's length . was the cause of more than one victory , they were obliged . indeed , to make every bullet count in the days when even lead was not produced here . and powder was imported , october 13 , the naval fight between the frolic and wasp took place .
it will then be seen that the movement of the arm . which , in all other cases , immediately succeeds the motion in the shoulder . is withheld -- is not made -- although maelzel has not yet performed , on the board of the automaton . any move corresponding to the withdrawal of the antagonist . in this case , that the automaton was about to move is evident -- and that he did not move .
they left their home in silence by the once convivial door . and from that hour those bachelors were never heard of more , we live on the nile . the nile we love , by night we sleep on the cliffs above . by day we fish , and at eve we stand on long bare islands of yellow sand . and when the sun sinks slowly down , and the great rock walls grow dark and brown .
from 1835 gogol spent almost his entire time abroad ; some strange unrest -- possibly his cossack blood . possessed him like a demon , and he never stopped anywhere very long . after his pilgrimage in 1848 to jerusalem , he returned to [location] . his entire possessions in a little bag ; these consisted of pamphlets . critiques , and newspaper articles mostly inimical to himself .
other characteristic traits appeared in hippolyto thucydides within no very long period of time . and he ran away from his lodgings so often during the summer that he might be said to board round among the outlying cornfields and turnip patches of charlesbridge . as a check upon this habit , mrs. [female] seemed to have invited him to spend his whole time in our basement . for whenever we went below we found him there . balanced -- perhaps in homage to us , and perhaps as a token of extreme sensibility in himself .
claire had passed through the various stages of intimacy with her . until on the occasion of [female] 's marriage she had acted as her bridesmaid . it was a long letter , too long to be read until she was at leisure . and written in a straggling hand that made reading difficult , she was mildly surprised that [female] should have written her . for she had been back in [location] a year or more now .
he noticed then that he was holding something in his hand . something soft and heavy , as he lifted it to look more closely . it flashed in the sunlight , it was the feather the phoenix had given him . the tail feather , tail feather ? ... but the phoenix 's tail had been a sapphire blue .
penrod marked the shapes of the great bass horns . the suave sculpture of their brazen coils . and the grand , sensational flare of their mouths , and he saw plainly that these noble things . to be mastered , needed no more than some breath blown into them during the fingering of a few simple keys . then obediently they gave forth those vast but dulcet sounds which stirred his spirit as no other sounds could stir it quite .
but the fat man was very fat , and the fat woman was very fat . and the donkey man was very old , and [male] was young and very fleet . so in less than ten minutes they gave up the pursuit and returned panting and quarrelling to the road . [male] sat on the further outskirts of the wood and panted . he felt on the whole exhilarated by the adventure .
the boat proceeded on her slow course and reached the channel between an island and the [location] shore . the wooded bank of the island rose directly from the water . some of the water elms dipping their roots into the river , there was no place where a boat could be hidden . and the ferry steamed slowly along , [male] poked solemn faced fun at mr. [male] in the most serious manner . and mr. [male] was sternly haughty , knowing he was being made sport of .
under them were the rank and file . about thirty in all , of whom perhaps seven were earnest workers , who looked on the brigade in the right . or [female] , spirit , the rest were entirely frivolous . the weekly meetings were always full of life and excitement . at this point it is as well to introduce [male] to the reader .
but the crusading passion of it made him so tobacco hungry that he immediately recovered the key . walked with forbidding dignity to the file , took out a cigar and a match -- but only one match ; if ole cigar goes out , it will by golly have to stay out ! later , when the cigar did go out , he took one more match from the file . and when a buyer and a seller came in for a conference at eleven thirty .
next morning we left in the train for switzerland . and reached lucerne about ten o'clock at night . the first discovery i made was that the beauty of the lake had not been exaggerated . within a day or two i made another discovery . this was , that the lauded chamois is not a wild goat ; that it is not a horned animal .
he is very poor , but scrupulously honest , his great ambition is to pay his rent . and he is devoted to his landlord , he is always cheerful and always good . we never knew a bad [male] on the stage . sometimes a stage [male] seems to be a bad man . such as the `` agent '' or the `` informer '' -- but in these cases it invariably turns out in the end that this man was all along a scotchman .
the only time in the day when he ceased to be the horny handed toiler and became the aristocrat was in the evening after dinner . when , egged on by lady [male] , who gave him no rest in the matter . he would retire to his private study and work on his history of the family . assisted by his able secretary , [male] , his progress on that massive work was . however , slow , ten hours in the open air made a man drowsy .
he had plenty of time and money . he was sure to run across friends in the big cities . and acquaintances he could make or not , as he pleased , en route . he was not sorry to go , his going would serve to put an end to what gossip there might be of his engagement to numerous young women whose admiration for him as an artist . he was beginning to fear , had taken on a more personal tinge , `` i wish , ''
this appeared to close the simple episode , the scenes , to be sure , had not been shot without delays and rehearsals . and a good two hours of the morning had elapsed before the actor was released from the glare of light and the need to remember that he was harold parmalee . his peeling of an egg , for example . had not at first been dainty enough to please the director , and the scene with the album had required many rehearsals to secure the needed variety of expressions . but baird had been helpful in his promptings , and always kind .
these considerations made him irresolute whether to proceed , but frenzy prevailing over reason . he determined to get himself made a knight by the first one he should meet . like many others of whom he had read , as to white armor . he resolved , when he had an opportunity . to scour his own , so that it should be whiter than ermine , having now composed his mind .
The Adventures of a Dog, and a Good Dog Too by [female] at [organization] this attachment of mine to the canine family in general . and their affection towards myself . have induced me , like the vizier in the `` arabian nights , '' of happy memory , to devote some time to the study of their language . its idiom is not so difficult as many would suppose , there is a simplicity about it that often shames the dialects of man .
for some months after his arrival , muriel had been to roland bleke a mere automaton . a something outside himself that was made only for neatly laid breakfast tables and silent removal of plates at dinner . gradually , however , when his natural shyness was soothed by use sufficiently to enable him to look at her when she came into the room . he discovered that she was a strikingly pretty girl . bounded to the north by a mass of auburn hair and to the south by small and shapely feet .
for an instant the nine horsemen had halted and surveyed us , now they put spurs to their horses . and with a yell of triumph they galloped down the road . they had recognised that their prey was in their power . at that swift advance all doubt had vanished . by heavens , sire , it is indeed the prussians ! ', cried soult .
outside there were several peasants , but for them i cared nothing . what frightened me was to see the gleam of a red coat . which showed that there were british in the place , however , i could not turn and i could not stop . so there was nothing for it but to gallop on and to take my chance . there were no troops in sight , so these men must be stragglers or marauders .
a man to whom the set of his clothes is as important as it was to sir [male] . does not carry a pocket book full of banknotes when he is dressed for dinner . he would leave it somewhere , reasoned [male] . where , he asked himself , the answer was easy . in his dressing room , [male] 's plan of campaign was complete .
mr pickering did not bolt , claire came towards him . still smiling that pathetic smile , a thrill permeated mr pickering 's entire one hundred and ninety seven pounds . trickling down his spine like hot water and coming out at the soles of his feet . he had forgotten now that he had ever sneered at marriage . it seemed to him now that there was nothing in life to be compared with that beatific state .
the corned beef , piccalilli and beer were excellent and he had enjoyed them . but the pancakes were to be his chef d'oeuvre . his main object in selecting pancakes was , as he explained to mrs. [female] . `` that they do not stink while cookin ' , '' from his sister in law he had obtained a general idea of how to proceed . she had even gone so far as to assist in mixing the batter , the fat was bubbling merrily in the frying pan as he poured in sufficient liquid for at least three pancakes .
and as bad luck always follers on in a procession . them mortgages of cephas'ses all run out sort o ', together . his creditors sold him out , and when his property wuz all disposed of it left him over fourteen hundred dollar in debt . the creditors acted perfectly greedy , so they say -- took everything they could . and one of the meanest ones took that insane bedquilt that i finished .
at this mistris sincere wonders extreamly ; saying how strangely these things happen to one woman more then another . in our parish there is a married woman brought to bed . but she was so miserably handled by the midwife , that no tongue can express it . insomuch that master peepin the man midwife . was fain to be fetcht , to assist with his instrument ; it was a very great wonder that the woman ever escaped it .
with [female] it was different , there was no pitying smile on adair 's face as he started his run preparatory to sending down the first ball . [male] , on the cricket field . could not have looked anything but a cricketer if he had turned out in a tweed suit and hobnail boots . cricketer was written all over him -- in his walk . in the way he took guard .
probably some large private school somewhere , anyhow , they are certain to be decent fellows . and he arranged the fixture , it then transpired that old crockford was a village . and , from the appearance of the team on the day of battle . the old crockfordians seemed to be composed exclusively of the riff raff of same , they wore green shirts with a bright yellow leopard over the heart , and c.f.c . woven in large letters about the chest , one or two of the outsides played in caps .
it is , therefore , not to be wondered at that the next day i find myself described as `` not a well man , '' although `` his face is ruddy , '' and `` his blue eyes have a tired look and his hand is not so steady as it might be . '' i would like to know whose hand would be steady if , after six days of atlantic travel . he was landed to find himself suddenly confronted with eight talented gentlemen . cross questioning him ad lib. .
at half past eleven , there being not more than three or four hundred people in palace yard . a number of press messengers . rushing helter skelter out of the court and into waiting cabs . indicated the arrival of some critical juncture within the jealously guarded portals . presently it was whispered that the lord chief justice had finished his summing up .
dowley and i fraternized at once ; i had had just such picked men , splendid fellows . under me in the colt arms factory . i was bound to see more of him , so i invited him to come out to [male] 's sunday . and dine with us , [male] was appalled . and held his breath ; and when the grandee accepted , he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished at the condescension .
it was nearly night when rodolfo arrived . and whilst preparations were making for supper , estafania took her son 's companions aside . believing that they were two of the three whom leocadia mentioned as having been with rodolfo on the night of her abduction . she earnestly entreated them to tell her . if they remembered that her son had carried off a young woman .
the works had this peculiarity , that instead of rising above the earth . as did the ancient ramparts destined to defend a city from escalades . they , on the contrary , sank into it ; and what created the height of the walls was the depth of the ditches . it did not take long to make d'artagnan perceive the superiority of such a system . which gives no advantage to cannon , besides , as the fosses were lower than .
naylor had a [male] style and a happy knack at felicitous metaphor . [male] 's style was wholly without ornament . but enviably compact , lucid , and strong , but after all , calder was the gem . he never spoke when sober , he spoke continuously when he was not . and certainly they were the drunkest speeches that a man ever uttered .
i might have mentioned chumpleigh to eliza , but i am sure that i have never told her all about him . however , i was not going to sulk , and so i told her the story again . the story would not have been so long if she had not interrupted me so frequently . when i had finished , she said that it was time to go to bed . and i had wasted the evening , i owned that possibly i had been chatting rather longer than i had intended .
as she left them her mother 's shout of [female] ! shivered the tranquil air , and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right . such a senseless lie , too , yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these emersons . friends of [female] 's , with a pair of nondescript tourists . [female] had come to her naturally , she saw that for the future she must be more vigilant .
[female] declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off . happy couple , said [female] , as soon as they were out of hearing , how well they suit one another , -- very lucky -- marrying as they did . upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place , -- they only knew each other . i think , a few weeks in bath , peculiarly lucky , -- for as to any real knowledge of a person 's disposition that bath .
you have seen these two young people -- bechamel , by the bye . is the man 's name , and the girl 's is [female] . from the outside ; you have heard them talking . they ride now side by side ( but not too close together , and in an uneasy silence ) , towards haslemere . and this chapter will concern itself with those curious little council chambers inside their skulls .
everything she observed in this sumptuous apartment showed her that its master was a person of quality . and of extraordinary wealth , among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver . standing on a cabinet near the window , she took it . and hid it in the sleeve of her gown . not out of devotion , nor yet with a felonious intention , but with a very proper and judicious design .
trying to ascertain whether they belonged to a man or a woman . he took them carefully out of the case and held them up near his mouth . he moved his own jaws experimentally ; he measured with his fingers . but he failed to decide : they might belong either to a large mouthed woman or a small mouthed man . on a warm impulse he wrapped them in brown paper from the bottom of his army trunk .
quiet and still she lay , the sea birds seemed to pause in their flight to look down on her . the little group of scotch people that had gathered stood and gazed at her with reverential awe . they made no attempt to put her together . it would have been useless , her gasoline tubes were twisted and bent . her tank burst , her sprockets broken from their sides .
and the philosophers were taking their cards and hanging up their waiters coats and putting on shabby jackets and bowler hats . worn sideways , and changing themselves by a wonderful transformation from respectable chinese to slouching loafers of the lowest type . but mr. [male] , being in an alcove and not in the kitchens . saw nothing of these things , not even when the head waiter .
george could make nothing of it . he stood there in silent perplexity , and might have continued to stand indefinitely , had not his mind been distracted by a dictatorial voice at his elbow . a second taxi cab had pulled up , and from it a stout . scarlet faced young man had sprung , one glance told [male] all . the hunt was up once more , the bloodhound had picked up the trail .
i took [female] into my confidence . to a certain degree , and we went to work privately , i told him that this was a sort of miracle that required a trifle of preparation . and that it would be sudden death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody . that made his mouth safe enough , clandestinely we made a few bushels of first rate blasting powder . and i superintended my armorers while they constructed a lightning rod and some wires .
[female] declared that she hardly knew whether that would come within mr slow 's line of business . and that she did not feel herself competent to give advice on such a point as that . she then explained , as best she could , that her own affairs were not as yet settled . but that she was led to hope , from what had been said to her . that the interest due by the firm on the money borrowed might become a fixed annual income for mrs mackenzie 's benefit .
mr. [male] was right , [female] never knew her desires so clearly as after music . she had not really appreciated the clergyman 's wit . nor the suggestive twitterings of miss [female] , conversation was tedious . she wanted something big , and she believed that it would have come to her on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram . this she might not attempt , it was unladylike , why ? why were most big things unladylike ?
we learned to wait regularly for the ceremony of seeing sir monocle and his load toted off to bed at nine o'clock every night . just as we learned to linger in the offing and watch the nimble knife work when the prize invalid of the ship 's roster had cornered a fresh victim . the prize invalid , it is hardly worth while to state . was of the opposite sex , so many things ailed her . by her own confession -- that you wondered how they all found room on the premises at the same time .
but both courses were equally impossible , he stood there , right in dr. [male] 's path . with terrified starting eyes and quivering limbs , more like an unhappy guinea pig expecting the advances of a boa . than a british merchant in the presence of his son 's schoolmaster ! he was sick and faint with alarm . and the consciousness that appearances were all against him .
not that the past should be buried , the music of life would be mute if the chords of memory were snapped asunder . it is but the poisonous weeds , not the flowers . that we should root out from the garden of mnemosyne . do you remember dickens haunted man how he prayed for forgetfulness , and how , when his prayer was answered .
cast off clothing , express prepaid . and free from all contagious diseases , accepted at its full value , anything left by mistake in the pockets will be taken good care of . and , possibly , returned in the spring , person oleson . who lives eight miles north of the county line . will show you over the grounds , please do not hitch horses to the trees .
behind her , a low voice , unheard by all except the person to whom it spoke . repeated a part of this speech : `` what did i tell you ? '' penrod and marjorie had descended by another stairway . and he now considered it wiser to pass to the rear of the little party at the foot of the stairs . as he was still in his pumps , his choked shoes occupying his overcoat pockets .
hoofs in the lane , i looked round me . and nature has blessed me with that quick eye which is the first of gifts to any soldier . but most of all to a leader of cavalry , between a long , low line of stables and the farm house there was a pig sty . its front was made of bars of wood four feet high . the back was of stone , higher than the front .
what it seemed to me was , that the ship would try to lie down and go to sleep on her right side . and then , before she had given that position a fair trial . would suddenly change her mind , and think she could do it better on her left . at the moment the man came up to me she was trying to stand on her head . and before he had finished speaking she had given up this attempt .
dear friend. -- i have just received your kind and cordial invitation to come to [location] and spend several weeks there among the eminent men of our proud land . i would be glad to go as you suggest , but i can not do so at this time . i am passionately fond of mingling with the giddy whirl of good society . i hope you will not feel that my reason for declining your kind invitation is that i feel myself above good society . i assure you i do not , nothing pleases me better than to dress up and mingle among my fellow men .
`` well , why do not you take the lickin '' and say nothing more about it ? i can stand considerable physical pain , so long as it visits our family in that form . of course it is not pleasant to be flogged , but you have broken a rule of the school . and i guess you will have to stand it . i presume that the teacher will in wrath remember mercy and avoid disabling you .
mr. [male] was her partner . she liked music , but how much better tennis seemed . how much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms . once more music appeared to her the employment of a child . [female] served , and surprised her by his anxiety to win , she remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at [male] croce because things would not fit .
he is safe , now , for heaven ; his next move will naturally be to keep out of it as long as he can . therefore he goes to the briddhkal temple and secures youth and long life by bathing in a puddle of leper pus which would kill a microbe . logically , youth has re equipped him for sin and with the disposition to commit it . he will naturally go to the fane which is consecrated to the fulfillment of desires . and make arrangements , logically , he will now go to the well of the earring from time to time to unload and freshen up for further banned enjoyments .
there was [female] , standing behind me , full of zeal . in this matter of shimmering into rooms the chappie is rummy to a degree . you are sitting in the old armchair , thinking of this and that . and then suddenly you look up , and there he is , he moves from point to point with as little uproar as a jelly fish . the thing startled poor old bicky considerably , he rose from his seat like a rocketing pheasant .
a war of words was about commencing . but the furniture cars drove up at the moment , when an armistice took place . in due time , the family of the plunkets were . bag and baggage , in their new house . a lover of quiet , the male head of the establishment tried to refrain from any remarks calculated to excite his helpmate .
but the taste of the present day is too corrupt for anything so classic . he has not yet been able even to find a publisher , the globe has not yet recovered from downey 's inroad . and they wo not touch it , i send it to you as one of the few lingering relics of that race of appreciative critics . who know a good thing when they see it . read it with reverence and gratitude and send it back to me .
it was not until [female] had been four days at sea . that the firm of [location] , morley , harkins . perkins , [male] , [male] , smithers . and hicks learned that the new partner had presided at a coney island banquet . given by himself to the office boys , clerks , book keepers , and stenographers of the firm .
there are no poor in [location] , they may be an unhappy people . knowing what a little country it is they live in . but , if so , they hide the fact , to all seeming . the dutch peasant , smoking his great pipe . is as much a man as the whitechapel hawker or the moocher of the [location] boulevard .
i must claim , in behalf of my town . that never in all my experience have i known a summer so hot that it was not . sooner or later -- by january , anyhow -- followed by a cool spell . but in the summer of 1895 even the real estate agents confessed that the cold wave announced by the weather bureau at [location] summered elsewhere . in the tropics , perhaps , but not at beachdale , one hardly dared take a bath in the morning for fear of being scalded by the fluid that flowed from the cold water faucet .
but fortune , who had other designs in her head . put an immediate stop to any such proceeding , by introducing an accident . which will be related in the next chapter , a dreadful accident which [female] . the gallant behaviour of [female] , and the more dreadful consequence of that behaviour to the young lady . with a short digression in favour of the female sex .
build a circular car , of course , one big enough to go all around the city . that would solve so many problems , with only one car , there would be no car ahead . which always irritates people who miss it and then have to take it later . with only one car , there could be no collisions , with only one car we could get along with only one motorman and one conductor at a time . thus giving the others time to go to dancing school and learn good manners .
the emperors , gazing up , saw her happy , and wondered ; saw noaks ring on her finger , and would fain have shaken their grey heads . presently she was aware of a protrusion from the window beneath hers . the head of her beloved , fondly she watched it . wished she could reach down to stroke it , she loved him for having .
on this day young [male] lawle and his friend and the dog rushed up the hill before mrs. wortle . and there began to romp , as was their custom , [female] , who was one of the party . followed them , enjoining the children to keep away from the cliff . for a while they did so , but of course returned . once or twice they were recalled and scolded , always asserting that the fault was altogether with [male] .
she was wearing a calico apron over her dress . an apron that had evidently been designed for a large woman , swathed in its folds . she suggested a child playing at being grown up . her sleeves were rolled back to the elbow , and her slim arms dripped with water . strands of brown hair were blowing loose in the evening breeze .
yesterday in the forenoon , as i stood with my brother at the parlour window of an inn . where we had lodged , a person passed a horseback . whom i instantly discovered to be [male] , he wore a white riding coat . with the cape buttoned up to his chin ; looking remarkably pale . and passed at a round trot , without seeming to observe [location] .
willing , we were impatient and said as much , at which i saw a flickering little smile cross moadine 's face . even then , with all those eager young things waiting to talk to us , a sudden question crossed my mind . `` what was their point of view ? what did they think of us ? '' we learned that later , i watched terry with special interest . knowing how he had longed for this time , and how irresistible he had always been at home .
in short , dissatisfaction began to display itself on every feminine face . no matter how high chichikov might stand in society . and no matter how much he might be a millionaire and include in his expression of countenance an indefinable element of grandness and martial ardour . there are certain things which no lady will pardon , whosoever be the person concerned . we know that at governor 's balls it is customary for the onlookers to compose verses at the expense of the dancers .
the question went up the line and a moment later the answer floated hack . tolliver person was down on tenth street , there was a bunch of other sojers who was goin to break it up and was down there now , but tenth street had a faraway sound and at the word a general groan went up and a score of the procession dropped out . among these were rose and key , who slowed down to a saunter and let the more enthusiastic sweep on by . `` i would rather get some liquor , '' said key as they halted and made their way to the sidewalk amid cries of `` shell hole ! ''
i soon found a sentence which threw a dazzling light upon the matter . it said , `` the gorner glacier travels at an average rate of a little less than an inch a day . '' i have seldom felt so outraged , i have seldom had my confidence so wantonly betrayed . i made a small calculation : one inch a day . say thirty feet a year ; estimated distance to zermatt .
the lessons ceased , she seemed no longer to think it desirable that her pupil should become proficient in the modern steps . he was puzzled by her decision , why should one of baird 's serious plays need an actor who forgot his feet in a dance ? there were more social evenings at the [male] home . twice the gathering was enlarged by other members of the film colony . a supper was served and poker played for inconsiderable stakes , in this game of chance the [female] girl proved to be conservative .
obviously , the making of such a list involves a responsibility which we do not care to assume . we do not like to risk the possibility that our own particular literary prejudices might rear a barrier between two fond hearts . after all , as somebody has said , fond hearts are more than conrads . however , we do venture the suggestion that if the young man 's intentions are honorable . fifty books is far too great a number for the experiment which he has in mind .
the large dining room at the rasselyer browns had been cleared out as a sort of auditorium . and in it some fifty or sixty of mrs. [organization] more intimate friends had gathered . the whole meeting was composed of ladies , except for the presence of one or two men who represented special cases . there was , of course , little mr. [male] . with his vacuous face and football hair .
he knew that he had talent . but talent without hard work is a poor weapon . and he had always shirked hard work , he had an instinct for colour . but his drawing was uncertain , he hated linework . while knowing that only through steady practice at linework could he achieve his artistic salvation .
`` glad it amuses somebody , '' said the man . we left him helping the landlord to pick up the broken things . and went our way , a dozen yards outside the door the faithful animal was waiting for his friend . he looked tired , but contented , he was evidently a dog of strange and sudden fancies . and we feared for the moment lest he might take a liking to us .
a rush call went out for a dozen of the precious store of golden eggs to be sent to the testing labs down range . two hours later , dr. [female] . surrounded by fellow scientists , stood before a bank of closed circuit television monitors in the frenchman 's flat headquarters building . the scene on the screens was the interior of a massive steel and concrete test building several miles up range . resting on the floor of the building was an open , gallon sized glass beaker filled with the new version of sally 's milk .
but as there is really no end to diddling , so there would be none to this essay . were i even to hint at half the variations , or inflections , of which this science is susceptible . i must bring this paper , perforce , to a conclusion . and this i can not do better than by a summary notice of a very decent . but rather elaborate diddle , of which our own city was made the theatre .
i was being haunted , and the physical repugnance of which i have spoken was on . the cold shiver , the invariable accompaniment of the ghostly visitant . had come , and i assure you i never was so glad of anything in my life . it has always been said of me by my critics that i am raw . i was afraid that after that night they would say i was half baked .
that such priests as lived in castles and villages should not be obliged to put their wives away . but that such as had none should not be allowed to marry ; and that bishops should not ordain priests or deacons . unless they previously declared that they were not married , in the year 1102 . archbishop anselm held a council at westminster , where it was decreed . that no archdeacon , priest , deacon , or canon .
to explain this seeming paradox at once , he was one who could truly say with him in terence . homo sum : humani nihil a me alienum puto . he was never an indifferent spectator of the misery or happiness of any one . and he felt either the one or the other in great proportion as he himself contributed to either . he could not , therefore , be the instrument of raising a whole family from the lowest state of wretchedness to the highest pitch of joy without conveying great felicity to himself .
i knew all along that it would not last , even in april i was saying that winter would soon be here . yet somehow it had begun to seem possible lately that a miracle might happen , that summer might drift on and on through the months . a final upheaval to crown a wonderful year , the celery settled that . last night with the celery autumn came into its own . there is a crispness about celery that is of the essence of october .
well , i took a drink and then i said to myself . i said , `` see here , i am going to see this thing through . '' so i turned back and walked straight upstairs again to my room , i fully expected something queer was going to happen and was prepared for it . but do you know when i walked into the room again the feeling . or presentiment , or whatever it was i had had , was absolutely gone , there was my book lying just where i had left it and the reading lamp still burning on the table .
he snatched the bag from the rack and hurled it out of the window . ( porter robinson , who happened to be in the line of fire . escaped with a flesh wound , ) then he sat down again with the inward glow of satisfaction which comes to one when one has risen successfully to a sudden emergency . the glow lasted till the next stoppage , which did not occur for a good many miles . then it ceased abruptly , for the train had scarcely come to a standstill when the opening above the door was darkened by a head and shoulders .
The Wit and Humor of America, person (of X.) by person happiness and laughter are two of the most beautiful things in the world . for they are of the few that are purely unselfish , laughter is not for yourself . but for others , when people are happy they present a cheerful spirit . which finds its reflection in every one they meet , for happiness is as contagious as a yawn . of all the emotions , laughter is the most versatile , for it plays equally well the role of either parent or child to happiness .
this little pink island is great [location] , the little mother of one fourth of all the countries of the globe , including [location] . the english people , or the british , are the most to and fro ward people in the world . like the bear in the fable when they are tired of going to and fro they reverse the process and go fro and to . in every quarter of the globe they have planted seeds of self government which today are blossoming into an english speaking union under the british and [location] flags that embrace one fourth of the surface of the earth . the climate of england is temperate , its air is not .
you also ask me to kindly lead the german while there , i would cheerfully do so . but owing to the wobbly eccentricity of my cyclone leg . it would be sort of a broken german , but i could sit near by and watch the game with a furtive glance . and fan the young ladies between the acts , and converse with them in low . earnest , passionate tones , i like to converse with people in whom i take an interest .
and , for my other essential of a country stick , it must be possible to grasp it by the wrong end and hit a ball with it . so it must have no ferrule , and the handle must be heavy and straight . in this way was golf born . its creator roamed the fields after his picnic lunch . knocking along the cork from his bottle , at first he took seventy nine from the gate in one field to the oak tree in the next , afterwards fifty four .
for awhile the adapter of the seventh pullet story enjoyed to the full his altered standing as a person of consequence . one who had had some share in the strange events of his times . then he was thrust once again into the cold grey background by the sudden blossoming into importance of smith paddon . a daily fellow traveller , whose little girl had been knocked down and nearly hurt by a car belonging to a musical comedy actress . the actress was not in the car at the time .
a donkey will spend his day in the doorway of a wine shop when he might just as well be enjoying the more sanitary and less crowded surroundings of a stable . it only goes to show what an ass a donkey is . anon , as the fancy writers say , we skirted one of the many wrecked aqueducts that go looping across country to the distant hills . like great stone straddlebugs , in the vicinity of rome you are rarely out of sight of one of these aqueducts . the ancient roman rulers , you know .
this same nature has been used as the principal argument for woman 's exclusive ability to take care of the young . it is pretty generally held that all a woman needs to do to know all about children is to have some . this wisdom is attributed to instinct , again and again we have been told by rapturous grandmothers that . it is not something which can be read in a book or taught in a school . nature is the great teacher , this simply is not true , there are many mothers in [location] who have learned far more from the manuals of dr. [male] than instinct ever taught them .
fundamentally as eager for authority as for information and butter scotch . if a man , a woman and a child live together any more in free and sovereign households . these ancient relations will recur ; and hudge must put up with it , he can only avoid it by destroying the family . driving both sexes into sexless hives and hordes . and bringing up all children as the children of the state .
he shaved a swath down the calf of one plump leg . the drain pipe was dripping , a dulcet and lively song . drippety drip drip dribble . drippety drip drip drip . he was enchanted by it , he looked at the solid tub .
when dexter 's won the final for the cricket cup in the summer term of two years back . the match lasted four afternoons -- four solid afternoons of glorious , up and down cricket . mr dexter did not see a single ball of that match bowled . he was prowling in sequestered lanes and broken down barns out of bounds on the off chance that he might catch some member of his house smoking there . as if the whole of the house , from the head to the smallest fag .
well , malim and i are unlikely to meet again in vernon place . nor shall we foregather at the little house in the hampstead road . the house which kit enveloped in an inimitable air of domesticity . her past had not been unconnected with the minor stage , she could play on the piano from ear . and sing the songs of the street with a charming cockney twang .
that was what i said i would do and that was what i did do that afternoon at pompeii . i found the gate looking toward the sea and i found all the other gates . or the sites of them ; but i did not find the roman sentry nor any trace of him . nor any authentic record of him , i questioned the guides and . through an interpreter , the curator of the museum .
the first thing is to decide among yourselves just what kind of court it is to be . there are three kinds : grass , clay , and corn meal . in maine , gravel courts are also very popular . father will usually hold out for a grass court because it gives a slower bounce to the ball and father is not so quick on the bounce as he used to be . all mother insists on is plenty of headroom .
these are the general bi weekly mensurs , of which the average student fights some dozen a year . there are others to which visitors are not admitted , when a student is considered to have disgraced himself by some slight involuntary movement of the head or body while fighting . then he can only regain his position by standing up to the best swordsman in his korps . he demands and is accorded , not a contest , but a punishment . his opponent then proceeds to inflict as many and as bloody wounds as can be taken .
with a shout i rushed forward and hurled the ball at him . it flew as swift as a bullet toward his ribs . but without a word he swung his staff and the ball rose a surprising distance in the air . lord rufton clapped his hands and cheered , again the ball was brought to me . and again it was for me to throw , this time it flew past his head .
mr bramble , nevertheless , pressed thro the crowd . and entering the house , [male] . i beg the favour of your acquaintance . i would have travelled a hundred miles to see this affecting scene . and i shall think myself happy if you and your parents will dine with me at the public house .
i find i succeed very poorly in conveying the impression i would like to of these women . so far from being ignorant , they were deeply wise -- that we realized more and more . and for clear reasoning , for real brain scope and power they were a no . 1 , but there were a lot of things they did not know . they had the evenest tempers , the most perfect patience and good nature .
i confess that i took a careful survey of the garden to see how fine a bouquet i might make for miss [female] . and was so abundantly satisfied with the material before me that i longed to begin the work at once . but that it would seem too hasty for true gentility , so i paced the paths . my hands behind my back , and my face well hidden by fragrant clouds of smoke . and went into wondering and reveries , i wondered if there was any sense in the language of flowers .
the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be subjected . were now the topics of discussion , the result of investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man . it had been long known that the air which encircled [location] was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases . in the proportion of twenty one measures of oxygen . and seventy nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the atmosphere .
we dismounted , and left our thanks once more for my lord . and then approached a crowd assembled in the center of the square . to see what might be the object of interest , it was the remnant of that old peregrinating band of slaves ! so they had been dragging their chains about , all this weary time . that poor husband was gone , and also many others ; and some few purchases had been added to the gang .
bindle , who had been a delighted spectator of the arrival of band after band . suggested to the leader of the eighth band in a roar that just penetrated to the drum of his ear . 'ad not you better start ere , there ai not no room upstairs ? the man gave a comprehensive look round . then by signs indicated to his men that they were to start then and there .
lotus eaters , a gang of ancient vegetarians . who chewed leaves and went to sleep , [organization] , a celestial messenger boy . who wore wings on his shoes and knew how `` to get there '' in a hurry , midas . a greek king , who had the power of turning into gold all that he touched , [male] . a love lorn poetess , who , failing to win the man she first loved .
strange , is it not ? -- that of the myriads who into the out of bounds have late play would through . not one returns to tell [location] of the stroke to guarantee the shortest hole in two . the swinging brassie strikes ; and , having struck , moves on . nor all your wit or future luck shall lure it back to cancel half a stroke . nor from the card a single seven pluck , no hope by club or ball to win the prize .
and so they hauled up the camel with many blocks and tackles upon the deck . being increased in weight by the brine , and the zouave started . [male] spent the two days of the crossing by himself in his stateroom . not because the sea was rough , or that the red fez had too much to suffer . but because the deuced camel , as soon as his master appeared above decks .
it is really surprising what a quantity of thirsty sentiments an occasion of this kind gives rise to . at last the tall gentleman -- or , as one of the watchmen called him . `` the long one '' -- was found stretched out at his length on the pavement before the door . completely done up , it was a [male] who found him . and a very honest [male] too , as times go ; but whilst he was endeavouring to gather him up .
`` i see , '' i said , and i went home again . and i suppose you see too , i have got to sell fifty jaguars to a man called [male] by the middle of next month . although i really have fifty fully matured ones of my own , there 's nothing to prove it . and they are so suspicious in the city that they will never take my bare word . so i shall have to buy fifty new jaguars for this man called [male] .
so i gave him dollar 2 to assist the poor heathen to a place where he may share the welcome of a cordial and eternal damnation along with the more educated and refined classes . whether the heathen will ever appreciate it or not , i can not tell at this moment . lately i have had a little ray of fear that he might not . and with that fear , like a beam of sunshine . comes the blessed hope that possibly something may have happened to the dollar 2 .
he told me that years ago he had a mild case of strabismus and that both eyes seemed to glare down his nose till he got restless and had them operated on . those were the days when they used to fasten a crochet hook under the internal rectus muscle and cut it a little with a pair of optical sheep shears . the effect of this course was to allow the eye to drift back to a direct line . but this man fell into the hands of a drunken surgeon who cut the muscle too much . and thereby weakened it so that it gradually swung past the point it ought to have stopped at .
tartarin felt death had come : he believed in a hoax . but , no , all [location] was there , waving their hats , all of the same way of thinking . behold the brave commandant [male] . [male] the armourer , the chief judge . the chemist , and the whole noble corps of cap poppers .
one december afternoon in the year 1875 . just as night was closing in , the steam tug liverpool , which had left harwich at six o'clock in the morning . was seen steaming into the harbour with flag half-mast high , it was quite dark when she reached the quay . but there was light enough for the crowd collected to see rows of figures laid in the stern of the little steamer . the faces covered with blankets , these figures , as it presently was made known .
a knight had risen to his feet , it was [male] , `` ah ! '' said the king , drawing a deep breath , sir [male] gulped . he was feeling more nervous than he had ever felt in his life . never before had he risen to volunteer his services in a matter of this kind . and his state of mind was that of a small boy about to recite his first piece of poetry .
she prayed me to come to her at once as she was in trouble . to a frenchman and a soldier there was but one answer to such a note . in an instant i was in the boat and the gondolier was pushing out into the dark lagoon . i remember that as i took my seat in the boat i was struck by the man 's great size . he was not tall , but he was one of the broadest men that i have ever seen in my life .
they were sitting on the verandah when he asked this question . it was growing dusk , and the evening seemed to invite confidences . sheen , looking out across the river and avoiding his friend 's glance . explained just what it was that made it so difficult for him to produce a gentleman friend at that particular time . he could feel mr bevan 's eye upon him .
two blocks from the grocery they stopped under a slippery elm tree . eeta peeca pie was stretching his neck looking straight up into the slippery elm tree . he said it was always good for his freckles and it helped his wishes to stand under a slippery elm and look up . while he was looking up his left hand let go the jug handle of the jug of molasses . and the jug went ka flump , ka flumpety flump down on the stone sidewalk .
`` and so , '' the boy continued proudly , `` i am foolin '' this bunch by lettin em climb the telegraph pole . [male] , aged eight , was a member of the band of mercy . of his sunday school , which was a miniature society for the prevention of cruelty to animals . the badge was a small star , and [male] wore this with as much pride as ever a policeman had in his shield .
o , the matchless power of silence ! there are words that concentrate in themselves the glory of a lifetime . but there is a silence that is more precious than they , speech ripples over the surface of life . but silence sinks into its depths . airy pleasantnesses bubble up in airy , pleasant words .
this she received while at breakfast on the monday morning . having sat down a little earlier than usual , in order that the tea things might be taken away so as to make room for mr maguire . of course she must go up to town instantly . by the first practicable train , she perceived at once that she would have to send a message by telegraph . as they would have expected to hear from her that morning , she got the railway guide .
when , after infinite pains , i had mastered this mystery . i began to look out for an opening on the press . i had no friends in journalism . not the remotest acquaintance , i made the tour of the newspaper offices in the town where i lived . was more or less courteously received , and uniformly assured that there was no opening .
`` i ought to tell you , '' she said . and her tone would have warned him had he been less occupied . `` that mr. [male] is a great friend of mine . '' but ginger was intent on the lighting of his cigarette . a delicate operation with the breeze blowing in through the open window .
[female] , agent about seven o'clock in the morning . with perfectly fine weather , we started from hospenthal . and arrived at the maison on the furka in a little under quatre hours . the want of variety in the scenery from hospenthal made the kahkahponeeka wearisome . but let none be discouraged ; no one can fail to be completely [male] for his fatigue .
it was not till the last glass was drained that he arose to seek his bed . and presently humming some old air to himself , he slowly mounted the stairs to his chamber . as we desire throughout this tale to make the actors themselves . wherever it be possible , the narrators , using their words in preference to our own . we shall now place before the reader a letter written by colonel harcourt about a week after his arrival at glencore .
ah , i see your courage will not brave laughter . you steal to the table , half ashamed of yourself as you set down your untasted peach . your sudden zeal to relieve those ladies of their plates serves as a very good excuse for the relinquishment of your own . you have rescued yourself very well from your dilemma this time . remember my advice for the future , never accept a peach in company .
still , i do not know about that ; upon reflection i think perhaps it was not . for indeed it is that tower that makes the other one live . if he had not said `` i can not tell a lie '' there would have been no convulsion , that was the earthquake that rocked the planet . that is the kind of statement that lives for ever , and a fact barnacled to it has a good chance to share its immortality .
administering a kick to the nugget , who showed a disposition to linger and talk about the weather . i moved on , and we reached the corner of the coal shed in safety . we had now arrived at the really perilous stage in our journey . having built his wall to a point level with the end of the coal shed . the architect had apparently wearied of the thing and given it up .
she had turned away ; she raised her hands to her ears . he looked at her a moment . and then he slowly walked to church , she wandered for a while about the garden . vaguely and without purpose , the church bell had stopped ringing ; the stillness was complete . this young lady relished highly , on occasions , the sense of being alone .
the piazza del plebiscito has an equestrian statute that wuz taken in the first place for napoleon . then changed to general murat and finally to [female] , it made me think considerable of the daily papers who use one picture for all social and criminal purposes . and for queen victoria and lydia pinkham . some of the principal streets are straight and handsome , with blocks of lava right out of the bosom of the earth for pavement . it give me queer feelin 's to tread o not [female]
between one may , when she stepped off the train , and 16 may , when she received eddy moore 's letter containing the information that he had found her a post as stenographer in the office of [female] rendal . it had changed [female] quite remarkably , [female] was from dunsterville . which is in [location] , emigrations from dunsterville were rare . it is a somnolent town ; and , as a rule . young men born there follow in their father 's footsteps .
the [male] answered , that this supposition must have been deduced either from their conversation or their compositions . of which the english could not possibly judge with precision . as they did not understand the dialect used by the scots in common discourse . as well as in their works of humour , when i desired to know what those works of humour were . he mentioned a considerable number of pieces .
and so it goes on -- not out in the open ; not press agented ; not advertised . but behind closed doors , he does not care for the stranger 's presence . nor does he suffer it either -- unless the stranger is properly vouched for . the best theaters in [location] are small , exclusive affairs . privately supported , and with seating capacity for a few chosen patrons .
these remarks did not help much to steady king sidney 's nerves when he met the marshal on the links . where , as monarch , he naturally had the honour . a large crowd of onlookers from the court had collected . and the players had decided to dispense with caddies under the circumstances . the first hole was only about a hundred and sixty yards ; a deep gully lay between .
to begin with let me admit that i did it on purpose . perhaps it was partly from jealousy , it seemed unfair that other writers should be able at will to drop into a sleep of four or five hundred years . and to plunge head first into a distant future and be a witness of its marvels . i always had been , i still am , a passionate student of social problems . the world of today with its roaring machinery .
if you see an overcrowded portmanteau , accompanied by a double locked despatch box . you may know that urgent private affairs have induced [female] bubble to leave the city hurriedly for [location] . if you see a small bundle , accompanied by a pair of handcuffs . you may know that urgent public affairs have induced sergeant smart to follow the same route taken by [male] bubble en voyage for [location] . if you see twenty-four patent reversible extra waterproof holdalls .
it was a question of work . and hard work , and small pay , he lived on his salary because he had to . but he did not resent his grandfather 's attitude . he was better satisfied to spend his `` weakly salary , '' as he called it . in his own way than to earn more by dining seven nights a week with an old man who had forgotten he was ever young .
the lady pondered a little upon this , and thus answered -- why , no , madam . i think not , di western hath described her brother to me to be such a brute . that i can not consent to put any woman under his power who hath escaped from it . i have heard he behaved like a monster to his own wife . for he is one of those wretches who think they have a right to tyrannise over us .
it was a morning in the middle of april . and the jackson family were consequently breakfasting in comparative silence . the cricket season had not begun , and except during the cricket season they were in the habit of devoting their powerful minds at breakfast almost exclusively to the task of victualling against the labours of the day . in may , june , july , and august the silence was broken . the three grown-up jacksons played regularly in first class cricket .
now , indeed , she was dismayed , who could be the gentleman ? was it mr slow . or a myrmidon from mr slow 's legal abode ? or was it mr rubb with his yellow gloves again ? whoever it was there must be something very special in his mission . as her aunt had , in consequence , deferred her drive .
the seven states known as the saxon heptarchy were formed in the sixth and seventh centuries . and the rulers of these states were called bretwaldas , ', or britain wielders . [male] , king of kent . was bretwalda for fifty years , and liked it first rate . a very good picture is given here showing the coronation of [male] .
as it has been explained to me , [female] and the other comedian are hired by a circus because the trained lion has suddenly become too ill to perform . [female] 's partner is to put on a lion 's skin and pretend to be a lion while [male] goes through the usual stunts of the trainer . including the feat of putting his head into the lion 's mouth . at the last minute the lion recovers and is wheeled out on to the stage in a big cage . [male] believes the animal is his partner in disguise and compliments him warmly on the manner in which he roars .
i recall that my first impressions of life were rather disappointing . i can not say that upon my arrival i brought with me any definite notions as to what i should find the world to be like . but i do know that when i looked out of the window for the first time it seemed to me that the scenery was rather commonplace . and the mountains which i could see in the distance . were not especially remarkable for grandeur , the rivers , too , seemed trite , that they should flow down hill struck me as being nothing at all remarkable .
scythrop was now in a hopeless predicament , mr hilary made a hue and cry in the abbey . and summoned his wife and marionetta to [organization] 's apartment . the ladies , not knowing what was the matter , hastened in great consternation . mr toobad saw them sweeping along the corridor . and judging from their manner that the devil had manifested his wrath in some new shape .
to stand gazing atpaul 's with mouth agape and eyes astare . or to enquire your way to the national gallery or madame tussaud 's . is a sure means of finding yourself ere long in the hands of the unscrupulous and designing . for my part , as i took my first admiring peep at the masterpiece of sir [male] . i whistled to myself with an air of nonchalance .
i would not here be understood to insist on the same fund of learning in any of my brethren . as cicero persuades [location] is necessary to the composition of an orator . on the contrary , very little reading is , i conceive , necessary to the poet . less to the critic , and the least of all to the politician , for the first . perhaps , byshe 's art of poetry .
[female] was so thunderstruck by this treachery that he could say nothing . it was only what he might have expected , for had not the clown served the pantaloon exactly the same the night before ? but that did not make the situation any the funnier now , particularly as the clown made such a noise that two real policemen came hurrying up . [male] did not wait for them , no one held him . and he ran away at the top of his speed .
she talks in the style that she imagines the person whom she attempts to personate would use . being one of the doctrines of spiritualism that a person 's character and feelings are not changed by death . to make the humbug more complete , she narrates imaginary incidents . asserting them to have occurred in the earth experience of the spirit who purports to have possession of her at the same time she is speaking . mediums in various parts of the country furnish her with the names of and facts relative to different deceased people of their acquaintance .
the southern girl ceased to look at the sunshine , already , at the mere sight of food . the extraordinary recuperative powers of the theatrical worker had begun to assert themselves . in five minutes these girls would be feeling completely restored and fit for anything . conversation broke out with the first sip of coffee . and the calm of the restaurant was shattered , its day had begun .
on the eighth day came a letter from [female] . a cheerful , even rollicking letter , things were going well with [male] , it seemed . as was his habit , he did not enter into details . but he wrote in a spacious way of large things to be . of affairs that were coming out right , of prosperity in sight .
they are always saying the ancient barons could not sign their own names . for they know less of history perhaps than of anything else . the modern barons , however , can sign their own names -- or someone else 's for a change . they can sign their own names ; and that is about all they can do . they can not face a fact , or follow an argument .
you speak this so civilly , said i , that it is enough to oblige an englishman to lay out a [female] d'or or two at your shop. . the bookseller made a bow , and was going to say something . when a young decent girl about twenty . who by her air and dress seemed to be fille [female] chambre to some devout woman of fashion . come into the shop and asked for les egarements du coeur et [female] l'esprit .
to lose would likewise have been dangerous , because she must have cheated , and the infanta . who watched her game , would , doubtless , have exclaimed against her partiality for mazarin . profiting by this calm , the courtiers were chatting . when not in a bad humor , [male] was a very debonnaire prince . and he , who prevented nobody from singing , provided they paid .
they provide single rooms of moderate size . the bed modestly hidden during the day behind a battered screen . the rooms contain a table , an easy chair . a hard chair , a bureau , and a round tin bath . which , like the bed , goes into hiding after its useful work is performed .
nature had done well by flack 's , the house itself was more pleasing to the eye than most of the houses in those parts . owing to the black and white paint which decorated it and an unconventional flattening and rounding of the roof . nature , too , had made so many improvements that the general effect was unusually delightful . bill perceived [male] coming toward him from the house . he threw away his cigar and went to meet her .
the seconds , also more or less padded -- their heads and faces protected by huge leather peaked caps . drag them out into their proper position , one almost listens to hear the sound of the castors . the umpire takes his place , the word is given . and immediately there follow five rapid clashes of the long straight swords , there is no interest in watching the fight . there is no movement , no skill , no grace ( i am speaking of my own impressions .
today every member of the community may be regarded as a railway traveller . so large a part does the railway play in modern life . and it will be admitted that , with all our improvements , the element of humour has not been eliminated from our comings and goings by train . we trust it never may , here , then , is a compilation of the `` best things , '' literary and pictorial , that have appeared in mr. [male] 's pages on the subject .
keep him , therefore , i entreat you . in [male] street , you will not find him a heavy companion . and i allow you to flirt with him as much as you like . at the same time , do not forget my real interest ; say all that you can to convince him that i shall be quite wretched if he remains here . you know my reasons -- propriety , and so forth .
dame within its wall of rock the flower of the brave have perished with a constancy unshaken . from the dungeon to the block , from the scaffold to the grave . is a journey many gallant hearts have taken , and the wicked flames may hiss round the heroes who have fought for conscience and for home in all its beauty . but the grim old fortalice takes little heed of aught that comes not in the measure of its duty . the screw may twist and the rack may turn , and men may bleed and men may person .
half past six in the morning , and all the crowd on the wharf and the boat due to leave in half an hour , notice it ! in half an hour , already she 's whistled twice ( at six , and at six fifteen ) . and at any minute now , [female] will step into the pilot house and pull the string for the warning whistle that the boat will leave in half an hour . so keep ready , do not think of running back to [male] 's hotel for the sandwiches . do not be fool enough to try to go up to the greek store , next to netley 's .
gradually [organization] had come to the conclusion that love . in the full sense of the word , was one of the things that did not happen . and now , as if to punish her presumption , it had leaped from hiding and seized her . there was nothing exaggerated or unintelligible in the poets now , they ceased to be inhabitants of another world . swayed by curiously complex emotions , they were her brothers .
aubert did not dare to lift his eyes to his master 's face . as he spoke thus , master zacharius appeared superb in his vanity . his eyes glittered with a supernatural fire , and his pride illumined every feature . and truly , if ever vanity was excusable , it was that of master zacharius ! the watchmaking art , indeed , down to his time , had remained almost in its infancy .
now i am once more in [location] , paying daily visits of several hours to the office of my solicitor . in order to assist him in the preparation of my brief . the other day , [male] jalpanybhoy and [male] chuckerbutty ram attended for the purpose of arranging their evidence . when i regret to say the former made a rather paltry exhibition of himself . being declared by mr smartle himself to be totally incompetent to prove anything whatever material to the case .
she was bending down with her back to [female] . stroking the cat in the doorway , [male] seized his chance . he dashed past her and up the stairs in stockinged feet like a flash of lightning . but emma , leaning over the cat , had espied a dark flying figure out of the corner of her eye . she set up a scream , out of the library came [male] 's mother .
there were men on the passenger list who were being seen off by fathers . by mothers , by sisters , by cousins . and by aunts , in the steerage there was an elderly jewish lady who was being seen off by exactly thirty seven of her late neighbours in rivington street . and two men in the second cabin were being seen off by detectives . surely the crowning compliment a great nation can bestow , the cavernous customs shed was congested with friends and relatives .
there , thank his excellency for his kindness to you . and go your way , muttered the officer to billy , who , without well understanding the words . drew nigh the window ; but the glass was already drawn up , the postilions were once more in their saddles . and away dashed the cumbrous carriage in all the noise and uproar that is deemed the proper tribute to rank . the youth heard that they were free to proceed .
then , with a start , he realized into how great a condescension he had been betrayed . and hastily added , with pronounced hauteur , things you do not understand . you run in the house , [female] went into the house . but she did not carry her obedience to the point of running . she walked slowly , and in that state of profound reverie which was characteristic of her when she was immersed in the serious study of [female] 's affairs .
you are up against it and it is up against you . which is worse , you are something for people to laugh at . you are also expected to laugh , it is all right for a thin man to be grouchy . people will say the poor creature has dyspepsia and should be humored along , but a fat man with a grouch is inexcusable in any company . there is so much of him to be grouchy , he constitutes a wave of discontent and a period of general depression .
in putting the finishing touches on the fifth act of a play he would quickly change to the composition of the first act of another . and , with lightning rapidity embellish the characters in the third act of some comedy . tragedy or history , that constantly occupied his multifarious brain . his working den at the blackfriars was crowded with a mass of theatrical literary productions . ancient and modern , while our lodging rooms were piled up with [location] .
well , of course , it was all right . do not you know , but i was losing several pounds a day over the business . i was getting so light that i felt that , when the old man kicked me . i should just soar up to the ceiling like an air balloon . the club was one of those large clubs that look like prisons .
such was the discernment of mrs wilkins . and such the respect she bore her master . under whom she enjoyed a most excellent place , that her scruples gave way to his peremptory commands . and she took the child under her arms . without any apparent disgust at the illegality of its birth .
with arms , hands , legs , or busts in wax . to say nothing of pictures and prints . all giving manifest indication of the mercies and favours innumerable which hundreds of men have received in that place from the hand of god . by the intercession of his divine mother . whose sacred image he has been pleased to exalt and sanction by a vast number of miracles .
prince [male] here today . looking fully ten years younger than when i last saw him at westminster . plays through live long day , and drives off fourteen miles for dinner at whittinghame . thinking no more of it than if he were crossing palace yard . our host , waverley pen .
several times after this the boy and his sisters came to look down into the pig pen . the pigs could tell , by the talk of the children . that they were brother and sisters . and they had come to the farm to spend their summer vacation . when there was no school , `` that 's the pig i am going to take home with me , ''
during all the time that the rupture between the king and the prince had lasted . the prince , who had long entertained a great regard for bragelonne . had in vain offered him advantages of the most dazzling kind for a young man . the comte [male] la fere . still faithful to his principles of loyalty , and royalty .
`` i have loved you for four , '' i retorted . i was cross with disappointment . to be dashed to the ground , you know , just as i was beginning -- tell me some more about him , i went on , i am a plain business man and hang on to an idea like a bulldog . once i get my teeth in they stay in , for all you may drag at me and wallop me with an umbrella .
`` yes , sir , '' said [male] , the door was closed and the men walked away . [male] trailed them a bit . not remaining too pointedly near the cabin , he circled around through fifth avenue to regain the place . softly he let himself in and groped through the dark until his hand closed upon the abandoned razor . satisfying himself that fresh blades had accompanied it .
he said that that would answer , and said he would come around in twenty-four hours and begin work again . he was taken ill himself and could not come . but i did not need him , i cut off all those things for two days and nights . in fact , i cut off all kinds of food . too , and all drinks except water , and at the end of the forty eight hours the lumbago was discouraged and left me .
we had no eventful experiences on the journey to relate . unless it wuz a interview we had with a young man . a freshman i believe he wuz from some college , travellin with his tutor , and he seemed real fresh , he seemed to have plenty of money but a scarcity of brains . or mebby he had enough brains .
truly he took a big job on his hands to take care of such an immense family , and differin so widely in cultivation , temperament and clothes . to lead the ignorant ones into civilization and keep peace in the family and among his own folks . he will have as hard work to do it as that widower i hearn on who had three or four children of his own . and married a widow who also had a number , and then they had several .
the clatter of conversation ceased once more -- stunned , as it always is at dinner parties when one of the gathering is seen to have assumed an upright position . lord [male] cleared his throat again . his tanned face had taken on a deeper hue , and there was a look in his eyes which seemed to suggest that he was defying something or somebody . it was the look which ajax had in his eyes when he defied the lightning . the look which nervous husbands have when they announce their intention of going round the corner to bowl a few games with the boys .
it was one of those heads which [female] has often painted . mild , pale -- penetrating , free from all commonplace ideas of fat contented ignorance looking downwards upon the earth . it look would forwards ; but look would as if it look would at something beyond this world. . how one of his order came by it , heaven above , who let it fall upon a monk 's shoulders best knows . but it would have suited a bramin , and had i met it upon the plains of indostan .
in case you are lost , or want to communicate with your friends who are beyond shouting distance . it is much quicker than telephoning to build a clear , hot fire and cover it with green stuff or rotten wood so that it will send up a solid column of black smoke . by spreading and lifting a blanket over this smudge the column can be cut up into pieces . long or short ( this is the way it explains it in the book . but it does not sound plausible to me ) , and by a preconcerted code these can be made to convey tidings .
he cocked his head , and looked at it with his right eye . then he hopped round to the other side . and looked at it with his left eye , with either optic it seemed equally desirable . he turned it over , it was an awkward thing to carry . it had so very many corners , but he succeeded at last in getting it firmly between his beak .
[female] 's success in this affair soon began to ring over the country . and various were the censures passed upon it ; some greatly applauding it as an act of good nature . others sneering , and saying , `` no wonder that one idle fellow should love another . '' young blifil was greatly enraged at it , he had long hated black [male] in the same proportion as [male] delighted in him . not from any offence which he had ever received , but from his great love to religion and virtue .
the gentle reader will excuse this enthusiastic digression from the story of queen bess and my soul friend [female] shakspere . if they were present at this moment , they would not dare deny the truth of this memory narrative . in the summer of 1595 , the periodical plague of [location] was thinning out the inhabitants of that dirty city . in the lower part of the city skirting the thames . the sewerage was very bad and but the poorest sanitary rules existed , after a hard rain .
he was doing this in a literal as well as in a figurative sense when [male] entered the school shop . [male] appeared curiously agitated , he looked round . and , seeing [male] , pushed his way towards him through the crowd . most of those present congratulated him as he passed ; and [male] noticed . with some surprise , that , in place of the blushful grin which custom demands from the man who is being congratulated on receipt of colours .
`` please , sir , '' said [male] complainingly . `` i can not open the door , '' now , the immediate effect of telling a person that you are unable to open a door is to make him try his hand at it . someone observes that there are three things which everyone thinks he can do better than anyone else . namely poking a fire , writing a novel , and opening a door . `` ca not open the door ? '' he said , `` nonsense , nonsense . ''
the wives of noted public men formed another element of discomfiture which the young duke had almost entirely left out of his calculations . it is sufficiently embarrassing to keep abreast of the possible wobblings and veerings round of a human husband . who , from the strength or weakness of his personal character . may leap over or slip through the barriers which divide the parties ; for this reason a merciful politician usually marries late in life . when he has definitely made up his mind on which side he wishes his wife to be socially valuable .
landscapes full of the dewy freshness and joy of the morning . night seens dark and full of mystery and melancholy . mountain and valley , hill and dale . ocean and rivulet , every phase of human joy and sorrow wuz depictered there . and every phase of peaceful and warlike life , it wuz a sight .
display in geology ; all kinds of rocks , crystal , clay , ores . nickel and all the metals for making iron and steel and makin em right there before you , explosives used in the under world . everything relating to the workin of salt mines , oil wells . metals , photographs ; maps , illustrating how these riches of the earth wuz deposited .
outside the house the two boys were together all through their boyhood . chambers was strong beyond his years , and a good fighter . strong because he was coarsely fed and hard worked about the house , and a good fighter because [male] furnished him plenty of practice . on white boys whom he hated and was afraid of , chambers was his constant bodyguard . to and from school ; he was present on the playground at recess to protect his charge .
he went east , and he found all the cow there was feeding in the field that had been made ready for her . and she licked her tongue round a whole forest at a time . and swallowed it and sat down to chew her cud , `` payah kun , '' said the eldest magician ; and he breathed upon the bare patch where she had eaten . and upon the place where she had sat down , and one became the great indian desert .
i knew by lady inglis diary that the children carried on their small affairs very much as if blood and carnage and the crash and thunder of a siege were natural and proper features of nursery life . and i tried to realize it ; but when her little [female] came rushing . all excitement , through the din and smoke . shouting , `` oh , mamma , the white hen has laid an egg ! '' i saw that i could not do it .
then all the young men caught the girls about their waists and began spinning around in a pretty dance of their own . and the fun continued until they were tired out , the king thanked the tiny wooden musicians and put them back in the ruby casket . he did not offer to take up a collection for them . there being no money of any kind in the valley of mo . the casket was then carried back to the royal treasury , where it was guarded with much care when not in use .
she certainly did surprising things , fleta . oh . give her back to us , great queen . for your sake if not for ours , queen . oh . i should be strong , but i am weak , i should be marble , but i am clay ! her punishment has been heavier than i intended , i did not mean that she should live among the frogs .
as it is , owing to the mistaken good nature of the rival generals . the date of the fixture was changed , and practically all that a historian can do is to record the result . a slight mist had risen as early as four o'clock on saturday . by night fall the atmosphere was a little dense , but the lamp posts were still clearly visible at a distance of some feet . and nobody , accustomed to living in [location] , would have noticed anything much out of the common .
the castle of [female] lay on the opposite side of the lake . a mighty mass of stone reared on a mightier crag rising sheer out of the waves . which boiled and foamed about its foot , steep rocks of fantastic shape hemmed it in . and many were the vessels which perished on these , driven thither by the frequent storms that swept over the lake . gessler and his men , tell in their midst .
he gave a slight sigh , -- the only sign of complaint that ever i had heard come from him . but the next day we learned what was [male] 's answer to the german 's capture of [male] and [male] . `` have you heard what [male] is doing ? '' the members of the club asked one another . there was no need to comment on it , the cool courage of the thing spoke for itself . meadows , -- [male] 's own man .
was later mal [male] mared , swam ashore . and thanked his lucky stars for his indigestibility and the illness of his rescuer . his story was published , still causes some comment , tradition also says that [male] never could look a fish in the face after the harrowing incident . ambition : dry land , recreation : mountain climbing . address : sodom , clubs : alpine .
2 , they have to [female] the arms because they could not get them elsewhere or otherwise . as i understand it , the public authorities , all over [location] . allow the five corps to keep swords , but do not allow them to use them . this is law is rigid ; it is only the execution of it that is lax . of course , where there is so much fighting , the students make it a point to keep themselves in constant practice with the foil .
for an instant he felt almost inclined to turn away and give the whole thing up in sick despair . even to return to market rodwell and brave the doctor 's anger . for how could he hope to explain matters to his family and servants . or get the garudâ stone safely into his hands again before all these guests . in the whirl and tumult of an evening party ?
was born and painted at sea , married at an early age , was a regular heart breaker . v. had an affair with one adonis . and later with vulcan , not much is known of her old ladyhood , as she refused to pose for statues when advanced in years . ambition : parisian gowns , the love of the gods . recreation : love , address : the louvre , [location] .
later on , the fever of ambition came upon him . and he taught school where the big girls snickered at him and the big boys went so far away at noon that they could not hear the bell and were glad of it . and came back an hour late with water in both ears and crawfish in their pockets . after that he learned to be a saddler , fought in the revolutionary war . afterward writing it up for the papers in a graphic way .
it was a sweet view -- sweet to the eye and the mind . english verdure , english culture , english comfort . seen under a sun bright , without being oppressive , in this walk emma and mr. [male] found all the others assembled . and towards this view she immediately perceived mr. [female] and harriet distinct from the rest . quietly leading the way , mr. [female] and harriet !
he lived only for the purpose of keeping the pigeon house in order . thinking only of making it larger so that it might accommodate more pairs . and the little child , was it not he who crushed the millet for the fledglings . who climbed the mango tree , going from branch to branch to see whether there was not some crack through which the rain came in , who knows ? perhaps the pigeons were leaving their dwelling because they no longer saw him ?
it was regretfully decided , in council , that no attempt be made to add queenie to the list of exhibits . her brothers warmly declining to act as ambassadors in that cause . they were certain queenie would not like the idea . they said , and herman picturesquely described her activity on occasions when she had been annoyed by too much attention to her appearance . however , penrod 's disappointment was alleviated by an inspiration which came to him in a moment of pondering upon the dachshund .
his looks were much the same as ever , but his mind was singularly altered . it was not that this or that passion stood out in brighter or in dimmer hues . but that the colour of the whole man was faded , as one trait disappeared . no other trait sprung up to take its place , his senses dwindled too . he was less keen of sight ; was deaf sometimes ; took little notice of what passed before him .
honour acted her part to the utmost perfection . she no sooner saw herself secure from all danger of bridewell . a word which had raised most horrible ideas in her mind . than she resumed those airs which her terrors before had a little abated . and laid down her place , with as much affectation of content .
[male] asked no questions , he never said a word . but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared . by that time everything we had in the world was on our raft . and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid . we put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing .
paul , thus released , was just hurrying towards the cab , when the stranger who had got out of it settled the fare with satisfaction to himself and turned sharply round . the gas light fell full on his face , and mr. [male] recognised that the form and features were those of no stranger . he had stumbled upon the very last person he had expected or desired to meet just then . his flight was intercepted by his son 's schoolmaster . dr. grimstone himself , the suddenness of the shock threw him completely off his balance .
The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg by [female] at [organization] it was many years ago . [female] was the most honest and upright town in all the region round about . it had kept that reputation unsmirched during three generations . and was prouder of it than of any other of its possessions . it was so proud of it , and so anxious to insure its perpetuation .
he said this with such a strange dreadful snarl that for the moment his face seemed quite changed . but presently when he recovered himself he got quite cheerful again . and said that it was perhaps unseemly in him , as the guest of the [location] people . to say anything against them , it is strange how uncle always refers to himself as the guest of the [location] people . living in this poor place , in these cheap surroundings , it seems so odd .
i opened the envelope hoping to find them . but they were not there , the envelope contained merely a finely written manuscript of thirty odd pages , unsigned . and then i read the story , when i began it was with a half smile upon my lips . and with a feeling that i was wasting my time . the smile soon faded , however ; after reading the first paragraph there was no question of wasted time .
july 1 2 3 were the dates of this memorable battle , the first day was rather favorable to [female] . quite a number of yankee prisoners being taken while they were lost in the crowded streets of gettysburg . the second day was opened by longstreet , who charged the union left . and ran across sickles , who had by mistake formed in the way of meade 's intended line of battle . they outflanked him , but , as they swung around him .
he had lived in it for years . without feeling the least curiosity to know whether the sun revolved round it . or it round the sun ; and he had watched . for at least half a century , the smoke curling from his pipe to the ceiling . without once troubling his head with any of those numerous theories by which a philosopher would have perplexed his brain .
every barrier had been removed , every thwarting force had been brought into abeyance . and afterward , with an inconsistency typical of human nature , the leveler of the road fretted at his son 's lack of aggressiveness . his eyes , ordinarily so hawklike in their vision , blinded to the fact that what his son was he had to a great extent made him . and if the product caused secret disappointment he had no one to thank for it but himself . instead his reasoning took the bias that the younger man , having been given every opportunity .
`` huh , '' ejaculated [male] , scornfully turning away , he went round the garden . the gardener had been quite right , there were guelder roses everywhere . but no syringa , he climbed the fence and surveyed the next garden . there were guelder roses everywhere , but no syringa . it must have been some peculiarity in the soil .
april 4 , tradesmen still calling ; carrie being out , i arranged to deal with [female] . who seemed a civil butcher with a nice clean shop . ordered a shoulder of mutton for tomorrow . to give him a trial , carrie arranged with borset . the butterman , and ordered a pound of fresh butter .
as the black inhabitants of guinea were unsuited to the climate and excessive cold of the country . they formed the diabolical project of getting christian slaves to work for them . for this purpose they sent vessels every year to the coast of [location] . the northern parts of [location] , and wales . and were even sometimes seen off the coast of cornwall , and having purchased , or entrapped by fraud or violence .
there 's another man , the lord help him who thinks he has the `` knack '' of being a carpenter . he is hammering up shelves to a tree . till the shelves fall down he thinks he is a wizard . yet this is the same man who swore at his wife for asking him to put up a shelf in the back kitchen . how the blazes , he asked , could he nail the damn thing up ?
at length a ray of intelligence burst upon the faces of his hosts . and they rushed to a cupboard and brought out a small black bottle . they brought the bottle over , and poured out a wineglassful . and handed it to him , making signs that he should drink it off quickly , `` ah ! '' said my friend to himself , as he took the glass and raised it to the light .
yet [female] cherished the memory of her parents . on her breast the girl wore a locket in which was enshrined a miniature of her mother . while down her neck inside at the back hung a daguerreotype of her father . she carried a portrait of her grandmother up her sleeve and had pictures of her cousins tucked inside her boot . while beneath her -- but enough , quite enough , of her father [male] knew even less .
so overcome was the occupant of the aunt sallie at this point of his story . that he requested [male] permission to leave his quarters that he might sit on the floor near the slivers of the shattered whiskey bottle . he needed stimulant , [male] readily granted the request . for he felt as if he would not mind having a little stimulant for himself . but as the last drop available for his purposes had been put to the use for which it was intended .
but he did not get out , he did not get out , because it is dangerous to jump out of a car when it is going at full speed . and the car was going at full speed , because the young lady . without turning her head or so much as saying a syllable , had driven down a handle that made the machine plunge forward like a buffalo and then fly over the landscape like a greyhound . the police made one rush to follow , and then dropped so grotesque and hopeless a chase . away in the vanishing distance they could see the sergeant furiously making notes .
in mighty distances , whether from earth to heaven . whether from 5245 gerrard to 137 glasgow , there is always that awful , that disintegrating blur . it was about the middle of this third period . during a mushroom trapping ramble , that the idea occurred to us . first to me , then -- after reflection -- to person .
to prevent , therefore , any such suspicions , so prejudicial to the credit of an historian . who professes to draw his materials from nature only , we shall now proceed to acquaint the reader who these people were . whose sudden appearance had struck such terrors into partridge . had more than half frightened the post boy , and had a little surprized even mr [male] himself . the people then assembled in this barn were no other than a company of egyptians .
a person having a long neck has the neck of the bonnet descending . the neck of the dress rising . and filling more or less of the intermediate space , one having a short neck has the whole bonnet short and close in the perpendicular direction . and the neck of the dress neither high nor wide , persons with narrow shoulders have the shoulders or epaulets of the dress formed on the outer edge of the natural shoulder . very full , and both the bosom and back of the dress running in oblique folds .
with my system thus in full swing i experienced the intoxication of assured freedom . to say i was elated does not describe it , i walked on air . this was my state of mind when i determined to pay a visit to the gunton cresswells . i had known them in my college days . but since i had been engaged in literature i had sedulously avoided them because i remembered that [female] had once told me they were her friends .
lilia went to the post herself , but in [location] so many things can be arranged . the postman was a friend of [male] 's . and mr. [male] never got his letter . so she gave up hope , became ill , and all through the autumn lay in bed . [female] was distracted , she knew why ; he wanted a son .
in the meantime , we had been swept astern of the ship . and being quite out of her lee , were at the mercy of the tremendous sea which was still running . we made a determined effort to put back , but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the tempest . we saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate artist was sealed . as our distance from the wreck rapidly increased , the madman ( for as such only could we regard him ) .
`` you are a chap , '' giggled [female] . there was just one moment , the moment in which , on going down to the junior day room of his house to quell an unseemly disturbance . he was boisterously greeted by a vermilion bull terrier , when mr . [male] was seized with a hideous fear lest he had lost his senses . glaring down at the crimson animal that was pawing at his knees .
twenty five lashes , in [location] and tasmania they gave a convict fifty for almost any little offense . and sometimes a brutal officer would add fifty , and then another fifty , and so on . as long as the sufferer could endure the torture and live , in tasmania i read the entry . in an old manuscript official record . of a case where a convict was given three hundred lashes .
he paused , mr [organization] eyes . which even in their normal state protruded slightly , now looked as if they might fall out at any moment . his face had passed from the plum coloured stage to something beyond . every now and then he made the clucking noise . but except for that he was silent , psmith , having waited for some time for something in the shape of comment or criticism on his remarks , now rose .
and it should be set on record that this admiration of theirs was not misplaced . he would have been hard to please who had not been attracted by sally , she was a small . trim , wisp of a girl with the tiniest hands and feet . the friendliest of smiles , and a dimple that came and went in the curve of her rounded chin . her eyes , which disappeared when she laughed , which was often , were a bright hazel .
i seen him wednesday , we had a glass of beer together in the huffbrow kaif . he was laughing and cutting up like he always done , you never know who it 's gon na hit next . him and me was pallbearers together for hen jackson no more than a month ago . or say five weeks , well , a man is lucky if he goes off quick . if i had my way i would not want no better way .
the officer who commanded this gang very wisely concluded that his business was now to deliver his prisoner into the hands of the civil magistrate . he ordered him , therefore , to be carried to a public house . where , having sent for a constable , he delivered him to his custody . [male] was now conducted before the justice , where the surgeon who dressed mr fitzpatrick appeared . and deposed that he believed the wound to be mortal ; upon which the prisoner was committed to the gatehouse .
this rodaja promised to do , and then returned to [location] through [male] . but he did not see [location] , which was at that time in arms . at length he arrived at salamanca . where he was well received by his friends , and with the facilities which they procured him . he continued his studies until he finally attained to the degree of doctor of laws .
he rode over the table cloth , over the sandwiches , patties , rolls and cakes . down the bank and into the river , they rescued him and the bicycle . fate was against [male] even there , it was a passing boatman who performed the rescue . [male] emerged soaked to the skin , utterly exhausted , but feeling vaguely heroic . he was not in the least surprised to see them , he would have been surprised at nothing .
there was but one thing to do , he promptly turned his establishment from an up to the minute book store into a second hand bookshop . the damaged books were marked down from twenty five to fifty per cent , the name over the door whose serpentine embroidery had once shone so insolently bright . was allowed to grow dim and take on the indescribably vague color of old paint . and , having a strong penchant for ceremonial , the proprietor even went so far as to buy two skull caps of shoddy red felt . one for himself and one for his clerk , [male] grainger .
he was in [location] at this time . having remained in [location] but one day , he had accepted a secretaryship from senator [male] of nevada . but this arrangement was a brief one , he required fuller freedom for his [location] correspondence and general literary undertakings . he had been in [location] but a few days when he received a letter that meant more to him than he could possibly have dreamed at the moment . it was from elisha [male] , jr. , manager of the [location] publishing company .
the spirit of bolshevism , the desire to throw off all authority and act independently . which had assailed him yesterday returned now with redoubled force . if he had been perfectly certain that he would not be found out , there is no doubt he would have kept it from her . and yet , after all , what was the glory of going to see [female] bracely if all riseholme did not turn green with jealousy ? moreover there was every chance of being found out , for lady ambermere would be at the garden party tomorrow .
religion is and has ever been a chief chapter of human life . false religions are the only ones known to two thirds of the human race . even now , after nineteen centuries of christianity ; and false religions are perhaps the most monstrous . complicated and thorough going specimens of humbug that can be found , and even within the pale of christianity . how unbroken has been the succession of impostors , hypocrites and pretenders .
wrote a book which everybody tells the rector they have not read . and then re reads it when the doors are locked . in [location] a law has been passed compelling booksellers to include a bottle of disinfectant whenever a [female] book is sold . ambition : a publisher who is not afraid of the police . recreation : reading her own books .
t be done , she owned up that she couldn t enlighten the world in that condition . but as fur as looks went , it would be perfectly beautiful , but i [female] t think so at all , but , as i say , miss flamm has a real hard time on t , all bard down as she is , and takin
[female] and her companion had watched from their window the details of this ceremony . to which , by the bye , they must have been pretty well accustomed , but they did not look so much from curiosity as to be assured they should not be disturbed . so , guards , scullions , maitres d'hotel . and pages having passed , they resumed their places at the table . and the sun , which , through the window frame , had for an instant fallen upon those two charming countenances .
as he spoke in this strange way , the old man cast his eyes on his bench . there lay all the pieces of a watch that he had carefully taken apart . he took up a sort of hollow cylinder . called a barrel , in which the spring is enclosed , and removed the steel spiral . but instead of relaxing itself , according to the laws of its elasticity .
said d'artagnan , my tenants are communicating , that , no doubt . now , is some amateur in hanging matters , at the same moment the cries and disturbance in the upper chambers ceased . silence , under such circumstances , surprises more than a twofold increase of noise . d'artagnan wished to see what was the cause of this sudden silence , he then perceived that this man . dressed as a cavalier , had just entered the principal chamber , and was haranguing the tipplers .
i have heard a good deal in praise of the rhine . and i am glad to be able to speak well of it myself , i found it most refreshing . i was , however , sorry that we had washed in it afterwards . i have heard from friends who have travelled since in [location] that we completely spoiled that river for the rest of the season . not for business purposes , i do not mean .
all you need is a kind word and a mittimus from the court . one enters this sanitarium either as a boarder or a felon . if you decide to come in as a boarder , you pay the warden dollar 15 a week for the privilege of sitting at his table and eating the luxuries of the market . you also get a better room than at many hotels . and you have a good strong door , with a padlock on it .
still , however , he continued to smoke unremittingly ( as if to make up in that what he lacked in ability to sit in the turkish posture ) . but it was soon manifest that the young man was suffering , his face was deathly pale . and , dropping his chibouk , he called out for his oriental host . the gentleman in the red cap appeared , and the sufferer informed him that he `` felt so bad , '' and he placed his hand on his stomach .
still , these were not ants but potentially men and women . they had names -- kerrigan and [male] . the kaufman trio , [organization] and many others . from where we sat they were insects . it seemed to [location] that it would be no trouble at all to flip the three strong men and the pony ballet into oblivion with one finger .
mr shute took off his hat . smoothed it , replaced it with extreme care . and turned his attention to the new comer , her heart gave a great leap . there was no mistaking the meaning in the eye that met hers , he cared , he cared ! he took no notice , his face was pale and working .
when he had gone i went into my bedroom and made a pile of my opera hat . it did not look very impressive -- hardly worth having a sack specially sent round for it . to keep it company i collected an assortment of clothes . it pained me to break up my wardrobe in this way . but i wanted the bidding for my opera hat to be brisk .
said freddie appalled , there were two things in life with which he felt totally unable to cope . crying girls and dog fights , the glimpse he had caught of nelly 's face froze him into a speechlessness which lasted until they reached daubeny street and stopped at her door , `` good bye ee ! '' said freddie mechanically , `` that 's to say , i mean to say , half a second ! '' he added quickly , he faced her nervously . with one hand on the grimy railings , this wanted looking into , when it came to girls trickling to and fro in the public streets .
with all her splendid common sense and practical everyday ability , roxy was a doting fool of a mother . she was this toward her child -- and she was also more than this . by the fiction created by herself , he was become her master . the necessity of recognizing this relation outwardly and of perfecting herself in the forms required to express the recognition . had moved her to such diligence and faithfulness in practicing these forms that this exercise soon concreted itself into habit .
of course you can always put a hot thumb on the bulb and watch the mercury run up . this is satisfying for a short time , but it is not the same thing as tapping . and i am wrong to say `` always , '' for in some thermometers -- indeed , in ours , alas ! the bulb is wired in , so that no falsifying thumb can get to work . however , this has its compensations , for if no hot thumb can make our thermometer untrue to itself .
the cause of the unaccountable delay of sir [male] and the relief parties among the heights where the disaster had happened was a thick fog . or , partly that and partly the slow and difficult work of conveying the dead body down the perilous steeps . a great many women have made the ascent of mont blanc . an english girl , miss stratton , conceived the daring idea . two or three years ago , of attempting the ascent in the middle of winter .
if it is fine we say the country is being ruined for want of rain . if it does rain we pray for fine weather . if december passes without snow , we indignantly demand to know what has become of our good old-fashioned winters . and talk as if we had been cheated out of something we had bought and paid for . and when it does snow , our language is a disgrace to a christian nation .
but this the duke waived , saying that the cashed cheque itself would be a sufficient receipt . accordingly , he reduced by one penny the amount written on the cheque . remembering to initial the correction , he remembered also , with a melancholy smile . that tomorrow the cheque would not be negotiable , handing it . and the sonnet , to mrs. [male] , he bade her cash it before the bank closed .
so close that he had used their dwelling as a store house for some corn . they must excuse it that night . but he would endeavour to get it taken out upon the morrow . he then gave them to understand , as an additional scrap of local chit chat . that he had buried the last proprietor with his own hands .
the book is out and is handsome , it is full of , , , errors ... but be a friend and say nothing about those things . when my hurry is over , i will send you a copy to pizen the children with . the little cloth and gold volume , so valued by book collectors today . contained the frog story and twenty six other sketches , some of which are still preserved in mark twain 's collected works . most of them were not mark twain 's best literature .
an essay to prove that an author will write the better for having some knowledge of the subject on which he writes . as several gentlemen in these times , by the wonderful force of genius only . without the least assistance of learning , perhaps , without being well able to read . have made a considerable figure in the republic of letters . the modern critics , i am told , have lately begun to assert , that all kind of learning is entirely useless to a writer .
the two batsmen who had followed the big stand were apparently having a little stand all of their own . no more wickets fell before the drawing of stumps . psmith waited for [male] while he changed . and carried him off in a cab to simpson 's . a restaurant which , as he justly observed , offered two great advantages .
ferrars was prompt in his appearance at the bloomsbury cottage . and mrs. [female] had been for a long half hour awaiting him alone in the little drawing room her face was somewhat pale . and there was a hint of agitation in her greeting . and a shade of gravity in his , she talked of [female] . and was full of pleasure at their meeting ; and by and by she spoke of ruth .
[male] moved on , still full of his new idea of crime . down the street was a novelty shop . the window decked with new year 's gifts . walking across to fifth avenue he selected one of the finest residences and rang the bell . a man in livery appeared in the brightly lighted [male] .
this is what was doing in the world outside , now inside the stone walls of oyster le main . whose grim solidity spoke of narrow cells and of pious knees continually bent in prayer . not a monk paced the corridors , and not a step could be heard above or below in the staircase that wound up through the round towers . silence was everywhere , save that from a remote quarter of the monastery came a faint sound of music . upon such a time as christmas eve , it might well be that carols in plenty would be sung or studied by the saintly men .
the [location] policeman , knowing the importance of his own safety . and the insignificance of the gangsman 's , permits the opposing forces to hammer each other into a certain distaste for battle . and then , when both sides have begun to have enough of it . rushes in himself and clubs everything in sight . it is an admirable process in its results .
as far as dress goes , a man only knows the things which a man must not do . it would be interesting if women would tell [location] what no real lady ever does . i have heard a woman classified contemptuously as one who does her hair up with two hair pins . and no doubt bad feminine form can be observed in other shocking directions . but again it seems to be that the semblance of poverty .
a carriage containing a couple of ladies was rapidly approaching . as toddie again raised his voice , madly i snatched my watch from my pocket . opened the case , and exposed the works to view , the other carriage was meeting ours . and i dropped my head to avoid meeting the glance of the unknown occupants . for my few moments of contact with my dreadful nephews had made me feel inexpressibly unneat .
many believe that [organization] 's other scientific experiments were productive of more lasting benefit to mankind than this . but i do not agree with them , his paper was called the new england courant . it was edited jointly by [male] and [male] . and was started to supply a long felt want , [male] edited it a part of the time . and [male] a part of the time .
the beautiful girl shivered with new apprehension , the eyes of snake le vasquez glittered with new hope . he faced his steely eyed opponent for an instant only , then with a snarl like that of an angry beast sprang upon him . benson met the cowardly attack with the flash of a powerful fist . and the outlaw fell to the floor with a hoarse cry of rage and pain . but he was quickly upon his feet again , muttering curses .
one day in oxford street he saw a hansom cab driver with a face besotted with drink and `` ripe '' for production as a slave to bacchus . barnard hailed the hansom , jumped in , and directed the jehu to drive him to his studio on [male] . in going up the hampstead road a tram car ran over a child . barnard was terribly upset by the touching sight , and told the driver to pull up at the nearest tavern . getting out , he looked at his `` subject , '' intending to invite him to refreshment before taking him on to his studio .
the rain had ceased , the blue had routed the gray . and driven it from the sky , the sun . low down in the west , shone out bravely over the lake . the air was cool and fresh , [male] 's spirits rose with a bound . he accepted the omen , this was the world as it really was .
it has all the fittin 's that belong to the actual ship . and all the appliances for workin it . officers . seamen , marines , mechanics , are sent there by the navy department . and the discipline and way of life on a naval vessel is fully shown . i wuz glad to see that it had a woman for a figger head , it looked quite well .
who could it possibly be ? well , there was only one way to find out . he dropped down on his stomach and carefully began to worm his way under the thicket . the branches grew very low , and the ground was full of lumps and knobs which dug into him with every movement . there were vines , too , and some prickly things like thistles . which had to be pushed out of the way without allowing their leaves to rustle .
a fence is , therefore , a great help , you may take up your position on the other side of the fence from the garden and lean heavily against it smoking a pipe . or you may even sit on it , anything so long as you are out of helping distance and yet near enough so that the worker will be within easy range of your voice . you ought to be able to point a great deal , also , there is much to be watched during the early stages of garden preparation . nothing is so satisfying as to lean ruminatingly against a fence and observe the slow . rhythmic swing of the digger 's back or hear the repeated scraping of the shovel edge against some buried rock .
he got no farther ; the bitter truth in such a taunt . coming from him , stung me to ungovernable rage . i turned and struck him full in the mouth . which i cut open with my clenched hand , his eyes became all pupil . `` you shall pay me for that , '' he said through his teeth .
john , charity never settles problems . it perpetuates them , you can not cure social defects by individual treatment . right , theodore , ideal , this scientific suitor will shower everything upon her [female] honors and admires . a host of servants -- i mean sacrifices . carriages and motors -- i mean character and morals .
since that night , taking pains that it should not be bruited abroad in society . i have instituted a course of inquiry . extensive and thorough , on this vital subject , and find , to my horror . that the fair [female] 's case is by no means surprising . but that there exists the greatest distress in our female community , solely arising from this unsupplied destitution of dress .
`` fail quotha , '' said a third man , who had not yet spoken . old , tall and sour of visage and wearing a printer 's leather apron . he had moved over from the further side of the room where a little group of apprentices stood beside the wooden presses that occupied the corner . and he was looking over the shoulder of master [male] . the moment was an interesting one , the speakers were in a great room with a tall ceiling traversed by blackened beams .
it was on the same floor ; being , in fact . the back parlour ; and had , as mrs todgers said . the great advantage of not being overlooked ; as they would see when the fog cleared off . nor was this a vainglorious boast , for it commanded at a perspective of two feet . a brown wall with a black cistern on the top .
love is like appendicitis ; you never know when nor how it is going to strike you . the only difference being that , after one attack of appendicitis . your curiosity is perfectly satisfied , no matter how many men have tried to flirt with her . a girl will step cheerfully up to the altar in the firm belief that she has found the one perfect human being in trousers who will never look at another woman . after marriage , a woman 's sight becomes so keen that she can see right through her husband without looking at him .
a policeman stopped him and explained to him quite politely the law upon the subject . my military friend agreed that it was a very good law . thanked the man for his information , and said that for the future he would bear it in mind . that , as the policeman pointed out , would make things right enough for the future . but meanwhile it was necessary to deal with the past -- with the fifty or so pieces of paper lying scattered about the road and pavement .
certainly ; certainly , tell them also that they will oblige me by putting in no apology . and as for your bill , i would prefer to pay it myself . i will exercise no anger against them , it is not they who in truth have injured me . as he returned home he was not altogether happy . feeling that the bishop would escape him ; but he made his wife happy by telling her the decision to which he had come .
there in that library window nook it is cool in summer . and warm in winter , so he sits and dreams . holding an open volume , unread , on his knees , some times he writes . hunched up in his corner , feverishly scribbling at ridiculous plays , short stories . and novels which later he will insist on reading to the tittering schoolboys and girls who come into the library to do their courting and reference work .
there was a ghostlike , chilling effect that left him uneasy . he called upon himself to remember that he was not actually in a remote and desolate frontier town from which the inhabitants had fled . that back of him but a few steps was abounding life . that outside was the prosaic world passing and repassing a gate hard to enter . he whistled the fragment of a tune and went farther along this street of uncanny silence and vacancy .
the confederates were protected by stone walls and situated upon a commanding height . from which they were able to shoot down the yankees with perfect sang froid and deliberation . in the midst of all these discouragements , the red brother fetched loose in [location] . [location] , and dakota , and massacred seven hundred men . women , and children , the outbreak was under the management of little crow .
some day the marriageable age for women will be advanced from twenty to thirty . and the old maid line will be changed from thirty to forty . when that time comes there will be surprisingly few divorces , the husband of whom we dream at twenty is not at all the type of man who attracts [location] at thirty . the man i married at twenty was a brilliant . morbid , handsome , abnormal creature with magnificent eyes and very white teeth and no particular appetite at mealtime .
mr. [male] 's wardrobe and a small boy were the only objects that dared to smile . a recent article in the [location] post on the subject of somnambulism . calls to my mind several little incidents with somnambulistic tendencies in my own experience . this subject has , indeed , attracted my attention for some years . and it has afforded me great pleasure to investigate it carefully .
they had quarrelled for about five minutes over those wretched matches . and then for another ten because he said that women had no sense of humour . and she wanted to know how he knew , after that there had cropped up the last quarter 's gas bill . and that by a process still mysterious to him had led them into the subject of his behaviour on the night of the hockey club dance . by an effort of almost supernatural self control he had contrived at length to introduce the subject he had come home half an hour earlier than usual on purpose to discuss .
there should have been no necessity that such tidings should be told by letter . it was cruel , very cruel , that such a moment should not have been made happy to her by his joy . the whisper made to her father should have been made to him . but that things had gone so untowardly with her , and then , in her present circumstances . she could not devote her letter to the one event .
uncle [male] l was sent with the telegram . for although a conspicuous object in a corner of the drawing room was a telephone hanging on a transmitter . [location] found all attempts to raise the central office vain . the colonel grumbled something about its being `` always out of order when you have got particular and especial use for it , '' but he did not explain that one of the reasons for this was that the thing was only a dummy and had not any wire attached to it .
it would make intercommunication in a measure ungeneral . [location] had eighty languages , and more custom houses than cats . no clever man with the instinct of a highway robber could fail to notice what a chance for business was here offered . [location] was full of clever men with the highwayman instinct . and so , quite naturally , the brotherhood of the thugs came into being to meet the long felt want .
it was not long after i had taken my official oath before an era of unexampled prosperity opened for the [location] people . the price of beef rose to a remarkable altitude . and other vegetables commanded a good figure and a ready market . we then began to make active preparations for the introduction of the strawberry roan two cent stamps and the black and tan postal note . one reform has crowded upon the heels of another , until the country is today upon the foam crested wave of permanent prosperity .
the bird knows all the time that he ought not to stand talking to the snake . but he is incapable of ending the conversation , roland was conscious of a momentary wish that he was the sort of man who could tell butlers that they forgot themselves . but then that sort of man would never be in this sort of trouble . the `` teal , you forget yourself '' type of man would be a first class shot .
`` fool , , ' '' she said with scorn . and without stirring from her place ; and , as she spoke the word . the veil seemed to descend over her face again , the light faded out . and , with a slight shudder , the figure imperceptibly resumed its normal attitude . the drapery stiffened once more into chiselled folds , and the statue was soulless as are statues generally .
it may perhaps be wondered at that the waiting woman herself was not the messenger employed on this occasion . but we are sorry to say she was not at present qualified for that , or indeed for any other office . the rum ( for so the landlord chose to call the distillation from malt ) . had basely taken the advantage of the fatigue which the poor woman had undergone . and had made terrible depredations on her noble faculties , at a time when they were very unable to resist the attack .
[male] was the popular favorite , the early comers had seen his interview with [male] . and were relating it with gusto to their friends . their attitude toward [male] was that of a group of men watching a dog at a rat hole . they looked to him to provide entertainment for them . but they realized that the first move must be with the attackers .
truella thanked the kind sorceress . and mounting the saddle of her stork flew away toward the high mountain in which dwelt the wicked wizard . but the naughty man , by means of his black magic . saw her coming , and sent such a fierce wind to blow against her that it prevented the stork from making any headway through the air . therefore , in spite of his huge wings and remarkable strength .
almost immediately after breakfast on the very first day , a creature with a small black moustache and shining teeth had descended upon [organization] and . vocal with surprise and pleasure at meeting her again -- he claimed , damn him ! to have met her before at palm beach , bar harbor . and a dozen other places -- had carried her off to play an idiotic game known as shuffle board . nor was this an isolated case , it began to be borne in upon [male] that [organization] .
maybe he 's a real burglar with a gun . even , i think , and by the time i dodge past the elevators and get out in the cold april wind . the sweat down my back is freezing , i give cat a long lecture on staying out of basements . after all , i can not count on having a burglar handy to get him out every time . back home we put some nice jailhouse blues on the record player .
we are permitted officially to confirm the already gladly from mouth to mouth whispered news of an approaching marriage between prince heinrich of [location] and the princess [female] . hereditary heir consumptive of the imperial provinz of maine . the marriage , so it is whispered , although performed in accordance with the wishes of the emperor as expressed by cable . is in every way a love match . what lends a touch of romance to the betrothal of the royal younglings is that the prince had never even seen the princess [female] until the day when the legislature of the provinz of maine voted her a marriage portion of half a million dollar .
who made themselves even with the gods , they are by [location] visitors frequently mistaken for the twelve apostles . it is but a little way down the road that the two bishops perished for their faith . and even now we do never pass the spot without a tear for them . yet how quickly they died in the flames , to these emperors . for whom none weeps , time will give no surcease .
'yes it is , said i , only it has been converted . they must be celebrating some native festival , then as i spoke the procession stopped and the head missionary followed by a band of beautiful girls . came down from a platform and placed garlands of flowers and beautiful wreaths on the shoulders and heads of those reformed cannibals . in less than an hour every one of the huge black fellows was covered with roses and pinks and fragrant flowers of all kinds . and then they started on parade again , it was a fine sight .
if imitation be the chief aim of comedy . how can any ordinary understanding be satisfied with seeing an action that passed in the time of king pepin and charlemagne . ascribed to the emperor heraclius , who , being the principal personage . is represented , like godfrey of boulogne , carrying the cross into jerusalem . and making himself master of the holy sepulchre .
there was an appalling silence to my appeal , it was not pleasant to have twelve masked faces turned upon you and to see twelve pairs of vindictive italian eyes fixed with fierce intentness upon your face . but i stood as a debonair soldier should , and i could not but reflect how much credit i was bringing upon the hussars of conflans by the dignity of my bearing . i do not think that anyone could have carried himself better under such difficult circumstances . i looked with a fearless face from one assassin to another . and i waited for some reply , it was the grey beard who at last broke the silence .
[female] was standing looking out of the window , she turned as the door opened . and then she saw andy , her lips parted , as if she was going to say something . but she did not say nothing , and andy , he did not say nothing , neither . he just looked , and she just looked , and then he sort of stumbles across the room . and goes down on his knees , and gets his arms around her .
in sight were plants and flowers familiar to one on books but in no other way . celebrated , desirable , strange , but in production restricted to the hot belt of the equator . and out a little way in the country were the proper deadly snakes . and fierce beasts of prey , and the wild elephant and the monkey . and there was that swoon in the air which one associates with the tropics .
he said it as if he had heard of her for years . two other priests arrived enthusiastically and shook hands with her and addressed her as `` kieth 's little sister , '' which she found she did not mind a bit . how assured they seemed ; she had expected a certain shyness . reserve at least , there were several jokes unintelligible to her , which seemed to delight every one .
for a time , of course , his return was made much of . fake interviews and rumors of threatened death and disaster in impenetrable jungles made frequent appearance . but in an incredibly short time the flame of interest died from want of fuel to feed upon . and , as mr. [male] had once predicted , the matter was soon dismissed as merely another of the multi millionaire 's well-known eccentricities . all of this the blaisdells heard from miss maggie in addition to seeing it in the newspapers .
that turned out to be the truest prophecy i ever made , the first surprising thing that the new-comers did was to seat themselves at the long table with the other aborigines . the lady aborigine being the only woman among the twelve men . it was plain that they had known one another previous to this meeting . for they became very good friends at once , and the men grew heavily humorous about there being thirteen at table . at that the lady aborigine began to laugh , straightway i forgot the outlandish gown .
having thus -- as far as we understand military matters -- both its flanks covered and its rear protected . its position was one which we ourselves consider very comfortable . it was thus in an admirable situation for holding a review or for discussing the constitution of [location] in reference to the right of secession . the following generals rode up and down in front of the army . namely , mr. [male] , mr. [male] .
so ( though i trembled some for the result ) i had to let it go on . for she wuz one of the relations on his own side . and i knew it would not do for me to interfere too much , and meddle . why , he did come right out one day and give hints to me to that effect . wall , it run along to the middle of the next week .
certainly the progress of science is a wonderful thing . one can not help feeling proud of it , i must admit that i do . whenever i get talking to anyone -- that is , to anyone who knows even less about it than i do . about the marvellous development of electricity , for instance . i feel as if i had been personally responsible for it , as for the linotype and the aeroplane and the vacuum house cleaner .
it is not necessary to insist upon an error so palpable , and yet it is one of which nearly every capital of [location] affords example . and the same council chamber that would treat a popular movement with disdain would tremble at the epigram launched by some `` elegant '' of society . the theory is , that the masses act . but never think ; the higher ranks think , and set the rest in motion . whether well or ill founded , one consequence of the system is to inundate the world with a number of persons who .
[female] 's last impression of the departing one was of a vast and greasy grin . stretching most of the way across his face , [male] , as blackmailer . in which role he now showed himself . differed in some respects from the conventional blackmailer of fiction . it may be that he was doubtful as to how much [male] would stand .
accordingly the alphabet was given again , we arranged to have one more tomorrow . as it will be mrs. [male] last night in town . we also determined not to have gowing present , cummings , before leaving , said it was certainly interesting . but he wished the spirits would say something about him . june 4.—quite looking forward to the seance this evening .
some hostesses , of course , will forgive anything . even unto pavonicide , as long as one is nice looking and sufficiently unusual to counterbalance some of the others . and there are others -- the girl , for instance . who reads meredith , and appears at meals with unnatural punctuality in a frock that 's made at home and repented at leisure . she eventually finds her way to [location] and gets married .
on the next day mr. [male] came , explaining to everybody that he had given up his day 's hunting for the sake of his wife . but he could say but little , and could do nothing , and he did not remain long . `` do not stay away from the meet another day , '' his wife said to him . `` i sha not get well any the sooner , and i do not like being a drag upon you . '' then the husband went away , and did not come for the next two days .
it is equally bad taste to govern a kingdom in a maroon robe with white horse hairs all over it . i once knew a king who invariably curried his horses in his royal robes . and if the steeds did not stand around to suit him , he would ever and anon welt them in the pit of the stomach with his cast-iron sceptre . it was greatly to the interest of his horses not to incur the royal displeasure . as the reader has no doubt already surmised , the robe of the king should only be worn while his majesty is on the throne .
so they were married , and the bride was very jealous of her husband 's beauty and led him a dog 's life . so he managed to get into debt and made her miserable in turn . as for the glass dog , the wizard set him barking again by means of his wizardness and put him outside his door . i suppose he is there yet , and am rather sorry , for i should like to consult the wizard about the moral to this story . a king once died , as kings are apt to do , being as liable to shortness of breath as other mortals .
the neighborhood was in all things a frontier between city and country . the horse cars , the type of such civilization . full of imposture , discomfort , and sublime possibility . as we yet possess , went by the head of our street . and might , perhaps , be available to one skilled in calculating the movements of comets .
every morning david climbed up to the ledge . bringing sandwiches for himself , cookies for the phoenix . and a wet towel , then , while he kept count . the phoenix did setting up exercises , after this , the bird would jog trot up and down the ledge and practice jumping . then there would be a fifteen minute rest and refreshment period , and when that was over .
shall i be car ri ed toe the skies , on flow'ry beds of ease . whilst others fight to win the prize , and sail thro ', bloody seas ? he was regarded as a wonderful reader , at church `` sociables '' he was always called upon to read poetry . and when he was through , the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps . and `` wall '' their eyes , and shake their heads .
a mother in law is subtle because she is a thing like the twilight . she is a mystical blend of two inconsistent things . law and a mother , the caricatures misrepresent her . but they arise out of a real human enigma , `` comic cuts '' deals with the difficulty wrongly , but it would need [male] meredith at his best to deal with the difficulty rightly .
the bowling had now become almost unbelievably bad , lobs were being tried , and stone . nearly weeping with pure joy , was playing an innings of the how to brighten cricket type . he had an unorthodox style , but an excellent eye . and the road at this period of the game became absolutely unsafe for pedestrians and traffic . [male] 's pace had become slower , as was only natural , but his score .
they had not gone a quarter of a league . when upon crossing a pathway , they saw six shepherds advancing towards them . clad in jackets of black sheepskin . with garlands of cypress and bitter rosemary on their heads . each of them having in his hand a thick holly club .
when they had gone about half a mile , they avoided the park land and entered a narrow path that led over the next rise of ground . at the highest point of this they paused and turned around , their eyes rested upon the mountainside they had just left . oppressed by some dark sense of tragic impendency , clear against the sky a broken . white haired man was slowly descending the steep slope , followed by two gigantic and emotionless negroes . who carried a burden between them which still flashed and glittered in the sun .
immediately after breakfast the next day , leander went out and paid a visit to miss [female] 's . bringing away with him a hooded cloak of the precise kind he remembered [male] to have described as unlikely to render its owner conspicuous . with this garment he succeeded in disguising the statue to such a degree . that it was far less likely than before that the goddess 's appearance in public would excite any particular curiosity . a result which somewhat relieved his anxiety as to her future proceedings .
an argument arose among a number of british officers during their time of service in the dardanelles . and wagers were made among them , the question at issue was as to which smells the louder . a goat or a turk , the colonel was made arbiter . he sat judicially in his tent , and a goat was brought in . the colonel fainted , after the officer had been revived , and was deemed able to continue his duty as referee .
the grumbling gamblers had to submit at last , and cards in hand they betook themselves to another room . so i was able to mount my first platform -- a collection of tables . now i do not know how it is , but it is a fact that there is nothing more unnerving than to stand on a table . the infantile prodigy who is put up on a table for the first time so as to be better admired by fair visitors . and who has previously struggled manfully from one end of the room to the other on the floor .
she sidled towards them and sat down . self-conscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man . or a man and one woman , [female] did not follow . but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way , her sister was a little disappointed in mr. [male] . having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers .
[female] , the oldest man in [location] . one hundred and four years old -- recently walked a mile and a half in two weeks . he is as cheerful and bright as any of these other old men that charge around so persistently and tiresomely in the newspapers . and in every way as remarkable , last november he walked five blocks in a rainstorm . without any shelter but an umbrella , and cast his vote for grant .
perhaps he had , for he was not in the humour to spare himself trouble in his effort to make the banquet a success . we helped ourselves plentifully to the contents of the tureen . which was much easier to do than to settle the disposition of the soup , [male] was in an ecstasy of delight at things having gone on so well thus far . he positively pervaded the place , nervously changing the napkin from arm to arm . and frantically flicking off imaginary crumbs , at length it happily occurred to him that it would be well to go and see after the cutlets .
personally i can think of no more exciting phase of the night life of the two greatest cities of [location] than the stunt of dodging taxicabs . in [location] the peril that lurks for you at every turning is not the result of carelessness on the part of the drivers . it is due to the rules of the road . afoot , an englishman meeting you on the sidewalk turns . as we do , to the right hand ; but mounted he turns to the left .
as we were dressing for dinner that night i took [male] to task . and tried to stiffen him up , i guess i must have mismanaged it somehow . for he said he would thank me to keep my paws out of his affairs . and then went into the bath room , where he shaved and growled for ten whole minutes . i itched to throw a bootjack at him , but compromised on doing a little growling myself .
they carried him to the hospital . but he never spoke again , and died on the next day but one , my husband would not let me go to see him . as he was not conscious and it could do no good , but after [male] was dead they let me see him in his coffin . lying there he seemed such a pitiful and ghastly lump of clay that it seemed strange that he could . in his old life , have vexed the world as he did .
the drive through the town and out to the galle face by the seashore . what a dream it was of tropical splendors of bloom and blossom . and oriental conflagrations of costume , the walking groups of men . women , boys , girls , babies . each individual was a flame , each group a house afire for color .
it included the chief justice of [organization] . the vicar general , and all the titled personages of both sexes in the city . so great was the desire of all to behold the sun of isabella 's beauty . which had been for so many months eclipsed , and as it is customary for maidens about to take the veil to dress themselves in their very gayest attire on the day when they are to renounce for ever the pomps and vanities of the world . isabella wore the same splendid dress in which she was presented to the queen of england .
with this i got a cut rate ticket home and surprised and horrified my parents by dropping in on them one morning just after prayers . i tried to get there prior to prayers , but was side tracked by my father 's new anti tramp bull dog . strolling through the public garden and the famous [location] common , the untutored savage from the raw and unpolished west is awed and his wild spirit tamed by the magnificent harmony of nature and art . everywhere the eye rests upon all that is beautiful in nature , while art has heightened the pleasing effect without having introduced the artistic jim jams of a lost and undone world . it is a delightful place through which to stroll in the gray morning while the early worm is getting his just desserts .
it seemed to be the present opinion of other waiters on the extra bench that things were never going to pick up on the holden lot nor on any other lot . strongly marked types , ready to add distinction to the screen of painted shadows . freely expressed a view that the motion picture business was on the rocks . unaffected by the optimists who wrote in the picture magazines . they saw no future for it .
he had not got as far as sentiment and emotion at that time . accordingly he started to express himself in action . he stood up and pointed to the empty table where the supper had been . then opened his mouth and pointed down his throat , then he patted that region of his anatomy where . so scientific people tell us , supper goes to , and smiled .
that modesty and chastity , which we now esteem as the chief ornament of the female character . does not appear in times of remote antiquity to have been much regarded by either sex . at babylon , the capital of the assyrian empire . it was so little valued , that a law of the country even obliged every woman once in her life to depart from it . this abominable law , which , it is said , was promulgated by an oracle .
but so was czolgosz , when a husband 's story is believed . he begins to suspect his wife , in the year 1830 the average [location] had six children and one wife . how time transvalues all values , love begins like a triolet and ends like a college yell . a man always blames the woman who fools him . in the same way he blames the door he walks into in the dark .
29 , when sir [male] was fitting up his great room , in york buildings . for publick orations , that very room , which is now so worthily occupied by the learned and eximious mr , professor lacy . he happened at one time to be pretty much behind hand with his workmen . and coming one day among them to see how they went forward . he ordered one of them to get into the rostrum .
i can not see why this particular girl should be held up as an ideal . she kills her mother , according to her own account this was an accident . it is not an original line of defence . and we are not allowed to hear the evidence for the prosecution . she also kills her baby , you are not to blame her for that .
pierre nouquet recovered his senses , and fell into his old comrade 's arms . `` and my son -- and [male] , '' cried [male] . in an accent of the most profound despair , at this moment a man . almost dead , dragged himself out of the hut and along the ice . these two cries were uttered at the same time , and [male] cornbutte fell fainting into the arms of his father and [male] .
round the skirts of the valley ( which is quite level , and paved throughout with flat tiles ) . extends a continuous row of sixty little houses , these , having their backs on the hills . must look , of course , to the centre of the plain . which is just sixty yards from the front door of each dwelling . every house has a small garden before it .
while we still gazed and enjoyed , the ruin was suddenly enveloped in rolling and rumbling volumes of vaporous green fire . then in dazzling purple ones ; then a mixture of many colors followed . then drowned the great fabric in its blended splendors , meantime the nearest bridge had been illuminated . and from several rafts anchored in the river , person showers of rockets . roman candles , bombs , serpents .
he advised that she should be soundly flogged , and the devil whipped out of her . her family , intensely angered at her for the trouble she had made them . or rather had caused them to make for themselves , were only too glad to accept the advice . the old man and two sons carried a sore bruise or two apiece they got from me the night before . and seized the opportunity to pay them off upon her , so they stripped her bare .
when all the crew were out of the vessel , halima with her father and mother . and her two nephews , followed next , all dressed as turks ; and the beautiful leonisa . her face covered with a crimson veil . and escorted on either side by [female] and ricardo . closed the procession , while the eyes of the whole multitude were fixed upon her .
these words produced the same effect upon d'artagnan as the hissing of the first bullet on a day of battle . he let go of both line and conger . which , dragging each other , returned again to the water , d'artagnan perceived , within half a league at most . the blue and marked profile of the rocks of belle isle . dominated by the majestic whiteness of the castle , in the distance .
now that his father was dead and that his uncle jonathan 's money had come to him . his pecuniary cares were comparatively light , and he believed that he could be very happy with [male] and his children . but then to be pointed at daily as a lion , and to be asked by all his acquaintances after the lamb ! it must be owned that he was a coward . but are not most men cowards in such matters as that ?
no matter , it 's sunday -- many orthodox people ... why , mr. [male] wo not even dine out on sunday . we can hardly go out formally because we are already out , you know . aunt [female] , will you sit over there on [female] 's right ? doctor [female] by me ?
the beginning of a big row , one of those rows which turn a school upside down like a volcanic eruption and provide old boys with something to talk about . when they meet , for years , is not unlike the beginning of a thunderstorm . you are walking along one seemingly fine day , when suddenly there is a hush . and there falls on you from space one big drop . the next moment the thing has begun , and you are standing in a shower bath .
to say the truth , as no known inhabitant of this globe is really more than man . so none need be ashamed of submitting to what the necessities of man demand . but when those great personages i have just mentioned condescend to aim at confining such low offices to themselves . as when , by hoarding or destroying , they seem desirous to prevent any others from eating . then they surely become very low and despicable , now , after this short preface .
she promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it . with the intention of finding it a very good scheme . it is remarkable , that emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey . was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew [female] . whose rights as heir expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded , think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy .
for whether towards [location] or [location] . whether by steam or gasoline they run . pedestrians keep getting in their way , chauffeurs are being slaughtered one by one . a new fool 's every minute born , you say . yes , but where speeds the fool of yesterday ? beneath the road he sleeps .
and as they later declared , under fire , anybody that could make out more than three words in five of person 's ole handwriting was welcome to do it . besides , what did it matter if a little bit was left out at the end of one or two of the lines ? they could not be expected to run the lines out over their margin , could they ? and they never knew anything crazier than makin all this fuss . because : well , what if some of it was not printed just exactly right .
such loftiness of soul had earned her an amazing bonus . for it had induced those who sat in the seat of the scoffers before to come hastily off . and join the thin but unwavering ranks of the true believers , who up till then had consisted only of [male] and mr. [male] . frankly , so blest a conclusion had never occurred to miss [male] : it was one of those unexpected rewards that fall like ripe plums into the lap of the upright . by denying a rumour she had got everybody to believe it .
he was not instant in season , but out of season . he could not be persuaded to do a thing while it could do any good . he was iron , he was adamant in his stubbornness then . but as soon as the thing had reached a point where it would be positively harmful to do it . do it he would , and nothing could stop him .
by the time mrs. [female] had pulled herself together sufficiently to feel brave enough to venture into the [female] . [female] 's presence of mind and smith 's gregariousness had combined to restore that part of the house to its normal nocturnal condition of emptiness . [male] 's stagger had carried him almost up to the green baize door leading to the servants staircase , and he proceeded to pass through it without checking his momentum . closely followed by smith who , now convinced that interesting events were in progress which might possibly culminate in cake .
now , i would -- nay , have -- on this very day before yesterday i did the deed . alone and entirely by myself ( as the school boy said in translating the `` bellum gallicum '' ) did i beard a railway refreshment room young lady in her own lair . i rebuked her in terms of mingled bitterness and sorrow for her callousness and want of condescension . i insisted , courteously but firmly , on being accorded that deference and attention that was the right of the traveling briton .
but squinty did not come , the farmer poured the sour milk down the slide . where it ran into the trough , and the little pigs began to eat . but mr. and mrs , [female] began looking for squinty , they turned up the straw . thinking he might be asleep under it , no squinty was to be seen , then mr . [male] saw the hole under the side boards of the pen , ha ! ', exclaimed mr .
it was delightful to rattle along over the moist roads in the early red sunlight that was creeping across the shorn harvest fields . the air was fresh and crisp , and little smoke blue mists curled through the valleys and floated off from the hills . sometimes the road went through woods where maples were beginning to hang out scarlet banners . sometimes it crossed rivers on bridges that made [female] 's flesh cringe with the old , half delightful fear . sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed by a little cluster of weather gray fishing huts .
she looked up suddenly and saw him entering the ball room . he was of commanding height and his face was the face of a man who has been exposed to the forces of nature . the wind , the waves , the sun . the mosquito had set their mark upon him . down one side of his cheek was a newly healed scar .
not in the least , said [female] , i always think the best lunch in the world is a bit of the servants ', dinner . it 's always the best meat , and the best cooked and the hottest served . there was plenty of lunch from whatsoever source it came . and the three young people were very merry , perhaps they were a little noisy . perhaps there was a little innocent [female] in their conversation , ladies do sometimes talk [female] .
around the turn came [male] alcock flaunting his edge in every stride . as they straightened out into the stretch the man behind [location] remarked . [male] alcock will win in a common canter . the [male] was content to do no such thing , although in with second raters he remained a nice horse and he was willing to do nothing common even for the sake of victory . he began to ease up in order to become companionable with the field .
squiffy became absorbed , he had read the story before . but a long time back , and its complications were fresh to him . the tale , it may be remembered , deals with the activities of an ingenious gentleman who kept a snake . and used to loose it into people 's bedrooms as a preliminary to collecting on their insurance . it gave squiffy pleasant thrills .
a chill vapor seemed to arise from the water . there was a melancholy note in the tweet of the low flitting birds . the rustling trees softened their murmur to a continuous whisper . soothing and caressing , the tinkle of the creek became more metallic and pronounced , near by . down the stream , a sudden chorus of frogs burst into croaking .
he replied , to keep himself warm , they told him frankly that they did not believe him . and sent him back to his lodgings in a closed landau . the personal testimony of the english minister was necessary to assure the authorities that the highland garb was the customary dress of many respectable . law abiding british subjects , they accepted the statement . as diplomatically bound , but retain their private opinion to this day , the english tourist they have grown accustomed to .
of the kind dear to domestic servants . and with this in hand he approached the door of the basement back kitchen . where [female] the cook and her assistant . [female] , the housemaid , were having a mid afternoon cup of tea . the windings of the humbler lanes of service .
below that are bare pink legs ending in little silk socks at a dollar an inch and wee slippers clasped with a simple emerald buckle . therein , of course , the child only obeys the reigning fashion . simplicity , -- so i am informed by the last number of la mode parisienne . is the dominant note of parisian dress today . simplicity , plainness , freedom from all display .
as it was never cold in the kingdom of mo there was . of course , no ice for skating , but [location] was composed of sugar syrup . and the sun had candied the surface of the lake . so it had become solid enough to skate on , and was , moreover , as smooth as glass . it was not often the king allowed skating there , for he feared some one might break through the crust .
the neighborhood was in all things a frontier between city and country . the horse cars , the type of such civilization . full of imposture , discomfort , and sublime possibility . as we yet possess , went by the head of our street . and might , perhaps , be available to one skilled in calculating the movements of comets .
they do not play goff at deeside , they bicycle . down the long avenue with spreading elm trees deftly trained to make triumphal arches . the bicycles come and go , whipsroom , [location] , thinks opportunity convenient for acquiring the art of cycling . [male] is got up with consummate art , has had his trousers cut short at knee in order to display ribbed stockings of rainbow hue . loose tweed jacket , blood red necktie , white felt hat with rim turned down all round .
simply that word , spoken quickly ; but not before this [female] had brushed against her so that she was aware that there was something very hard and metallic underneath his gray gown . she betrayed no sign of knowledge or surprise on her face . however , but affected to be absorbed wholly in the fortunes of young geoffrey , whom she saw collared and summarily put into a cage like prison whose front was thick iron bars . and whose depth was in the vast outer wall of the monastery . with a little window at the rear , covered with snow .
all that can be said against the french sublime , in this instance of it . is this : -- that the grandeur is more in the word , and less in the thing . no doubt , the ocean fills the mind with vast ideas . but [location] being so far inland , it was not likely i should run post a hundred miles out of it . to try the experiment ; -- the parisian barber meant nothing .
and as we read the further details of the love scene it seemed to [location] that [male] had made a most fortunate choice when he decided to go to [location] . his football experience stood him in good stead in his love making . for he had been trained with an eleven which tackled around the neck . whatever the reason , [male] dempsey does not read [male] shaw much . but he has heard of him , when some reporter came to dempsey a day or so before the fight and told him that shaw had fixed fifty to one as the proper odds on carpentier .
though she was smiling , there were tears in her voice as well as in her eyes . `` my dear niece , '' said mr. [male] , softly . and [female] put out her arms and drew the baroness toward her . while [male] turned away , with his hands stealing into his pockets . a few days after the baroness [female] had presented herself to her [location] [female] she came .
mrs. raleigh jones , from the west . sends her daughter to a ; mrs. [female] . from the same city , sends her daughter to b , upon consulting the local social register . it is found that mr. raleigh jones is a member of the union . colonial , town and country .
and , as for audiences , for intelligence , for attention . well , if i want to find listeners who can hear and understand about the great spaces of lake huron . let me tell of it , every time face to face with the blue eyes of the infant class . fresh from the infinity of spaces greater still , talk of grown-up people all you like . but for listeners let me have the infant class with their pinafores and their teddy bears and their feet not even touching the floor .
our next illustration shows the birthplace of president garfield . he was born plainly at orange , cuyahoga county , [location] . here he spent his childhood in preparing for the presidency . lying on his stomach for hours by the light of a pine knot . studying all about the tariff , and ascertaining how many would remain if [male] had seven apples and gave three to [male] and two to [male] .
being proud of their wealth and of the gifts they had brought for the pastor . they could scarcely wait for the moment when the deacon passed the contribution box . but at last the time came , and the farmer held his hand high over the box and dropped the gold piece so that all the congregation could see what he had given . the woman did likewise , feeling important and happy at being able to give the good parson so much . the parson , watching from the pulpit , saw the gold drop into the box .
may 3 , sunday , fifteen or twenty africanders who will end their voyage today and strike for their several homes from delagoa bay tomorrow . sat up singing on the afterdeck in the moonlight till three a.m. good fun and wholesome . and the songs were clean songs , and some of them were hallowed by tender associations . finally , in a pause , a man asked , `` have you heard about the fellow that kept a diary crossing the atlantic ? '' it was a discord , a wet blanket .
perhaps he suffered from some muscular weakness of the face which made him smile like that . nevertheless , he certainly wished that he had not allowed himself to be deprived of his sword and armour . at the time it had seemed to him that the earl 's remark that the latter needed polishing and the former stropping betrayed only a kindly consideration for his guest 's well being . now , it had the aspect of being part of a carefully constructed plot . on the other hand -- here philosophy came to his rescue .
`` what do you mean you own the piece ? '' mr goble at length gurgled . he broke off abruptly , not because he had said all that he wished to say . for he had only touched the fringe of his subject . but because at this point wally 's elbow smote him in the parts about the third button of his waistcoat and jarred all the breath out of him .
he started back , the paper falling upon the tiled path that led from the gate to the front door . he looked at the number on the door . back again at the paper , then once more at the number , apparently satisfied that there was no mistake . he knocked again , a feeble , half hearted knock that testified to the tremors within him . he had been graded [organization] ; but he possessed a wife who was .
`` wake up , [female] , you old ass ! '' she cried , in a voice that hit me between the eyebrows and went out at the back of my head . if aunt dahlia has a fault . it is that she is apt to address a vis a vis as if he were somebody half a mile away whom she had observed riding over hounds . a throwback , no doubt , to the time when she counted the day lost that was not spent in chivvying some unfortunate fox over the countryside .
[female] was easily prevailed on to follow the counsel of her friend . which was heartily seconded by her maid , mrs fitzpatrick likewise offered to bear her cousin company . which [female] , with much complacence , accepted , the mistress was no sooner in bed than the maid prepared to follow her example . she began to make many apologies to her sister [female] for leaving her alone in so horrid a place as an inn . but the other stopt her short , being as well inclined to a nap as herself .
well , as an eminent master of fiction frequently observes in his writings . `` that is another story , '' which i shall hope some day to tell for your instruction and my own aggrandizement . it happened last christmas eve . and precisely as i am about to set it forth , it has been said by critics that i am a romancer of the wildest sort . but that is where my critics are wrong , i grant that the experiences through which i have passed .
and he shimmered off to his lair , obstinate devil ! so dashed absurd , do not you know , it was not as if there was anything wrong with that country gentleman hat . it was a remarkably priceless effort , and much admired by the lads . but , just because he preferred the longacre , he left me flat . it was shortly after this that young motty got the idea of bringing pals back in the small hours to continue the gay revels in the home .
for farnsworth , it was more than a surprise . it was a relief , then his betrothed had been right . jim had not fired the shot , he felt a glow of admiration for nancy 's sure intuition and loyalty to her pupil . he rejoiced that jim was cleared for her sake and for the boy 's . insensibly he had grown more and more interested in jim and attached to him .
i never saw a man laugh so much , i quite lost my temper with him at last . and i pointed out to him what a drivelling maniac of an imbecile idiot he was . but he only roared the louder , and then , just as i was landing the shirt . i noticed that it was not my shirt at all . but [male] 's , which i had mistaken for mine ; whereupon the humour of the thing struck me for the first time .
i snuck it from the glass of water she had stuck it in . and tore it up and put it on the floor and smashed it with my foot . when neither him nor her was watchin me -- i would like to rub the stem acrost his nose . and i wish they would never be another rose , it seemed to me like heaven , bein there with only her besides the sheep and birds , and [location] not sayin
mrs. [female] and her husband would no doubt have protested . demanded explanations , insisted upon being put down at once , had they been able . but , whether it was that the car had some peculiarly soporific tendency . or whether it was merely the sudden swift rush through the upper air . a torpor had already fallen on the whole [female] family .
i was touched to the quick with pity . for the rest of the class answered up brightly and handsomely , while he . why , dear me , he did not know anything . so to speak , he was evidently good , and sweet , and lovable , and guileless . and so it was exceedingly painful to see him stand there , as serene as a graven image .
`` thank you , sir , '' said mrs. [female] . withdrawing from the presence , [female] , oh , hang it ! i had not met him for years . and , glad as i am , as a general thing , to see the friends of my youth when they drop in for a chat . i doubted whether i was quite equal to [male] at the moment .
for six weeks , on every week day from three to five p.m . i maintained this schedule religiously -- at least i used a good many religious words while so engaged . and then i went on the scales to find out what progress i had made toward attaining the desired result . i had kept off the scales until then because i was saving up . as it were , to give myself a nice jolly surprise party .
so tense was eustace 's concentration that he did not see [male] . seated in the front row , [male] had watched him enter with a little thrill of embarrassment . she wished that she had been content with one of the seats at the back . but her friend [female] , who accompanied her . had insisted on the front row , in order to avoid recognition for as long as possible .
the bride hystericky in the carriage and at the station wept so that i was fair beside myself . did bethink me to kiss her in the train . but small comfort to either , what will become of my affairs i know not . this place being all without stock reports and i half mad and with naught to pass the time . comes my wife as i write and will have the key to her largest trunk the same it doth appear is lost .
the clerk stooped to pick up his glasses , the magistrate blew his nose violently to gain time . the reporters prepared to take notes , then the storm burst . `` you shall pay for this , all of you , '' shouted the man in the dock . jerking his head forward to emphasise his words , his arms being firmly held straight to his sides . me a burglar -- me ? ', he sobbed .
then there are the old ladies who worship a fat poodle , scant of breath and full of fleas . i knew a couple of elderly spinsters once who had a sort of german sausage on legs which they called a dog between them . they used to wash its face with warm water every morning . it had a mutton cutlet regularly for breakfast . and on sundays , when one of the ladies went to church .
the night before leaving rome person and myself climbed upon the topmost rim of the crumbling coliseum and gazed down upon the sleeping moonlit capital with entranced admiration . after five days of sightseeing we took the public stage for [location] . guarded by soldiers , and arrived safely on board the albion . which sailed away , through [location] , around classic person to negropont and on to [location] . [location] , where we anchored for a load of dates .
what i mean is , if you are absolutely off your rocker . but do not find it convenient to be scooped into the luny bin , you simply explain that . when you said you were a teapot . it was just your artistic temperament , and they apologize and go away . so i stood by to hear just how the [location] had affected person .
fate seemed to fight for him , on one of the pegs in the wall hung a mackintosh . a large , blessed mackintosh , he was inside it in a moment . four minutes later he rushed into his place in chapel . but between his costume and that of the rest there was this subtle distinction . they wore their own mackintoshes , he wore somebody else 's .
at the conclusion of the meal , he drew his pipe from his pocket and proceeded to smoke with a view to inspiration . `` 'oly ointment , she 's fallen out , '' he muttered . as he made for the door and dashed up the stairs two at a time . as he opened the door , he found mrs. [female] sitting up in bed . a red flannel petticoat round her shoulders .
we have deliberately neglected this great heritage of high national sentiment . we have made our public schools the strongest walls against a whisper of the honour of england . and we have had our punishment in this strange and perverted fact that . while a unifying vision of patriotism can ennoble bands of brutal savages or dingy burghers . and be the best thing in their lives , we , who are .
and then , as he stepped through the window , his heart gave a sudden leap . at the corner of the balcony he had just recognised daphne . she was quite alone , and he recognised that the opportunity . half feared , half desired , had come at last , daphne turned and saw prince [male] almost immediately . and , after making the prescribed curtsey , was about to retreat indoors when he stopped her .
on the other hand , why should he not write to his wife on wilkins 's paper ? was he afraid of his wife ? he was not , would not the news ultimately reach bursley that he had stayed at wilkins 's , it would . nevertheless , he could not find the courage to write to nellie on wilkins 's paper . he looked around , he was fearfully alone , he wanted the companionship .
however , he wrote nothing further for the `` post . '' orion printed two of his sketches in the `` journal , '' which was the extent of his efforts at this time . none of this early work has been preserved , files of the `` post '' exist . but the sketches were unsigned and could hardly be identified , the [male] paper dragged along from year to year .
some philosopher , of extraordinary powers of intuition . once informed the world that the best of things come at last to an end . the statement was tested , and is now universally accepted as correct , to apply the general to the particular . the play came to an end amidst uproarious applause . to which [location] contributed an unstinted quotum , about three hours after it had begun .
from the sands of the sea we make sugar for sweetening our coffee . that mysterious beverage , the secret of whose manufacture has never been revealed . from the cotton plant comes the woolen under garment and the soldier 's blanket . from the lowly cabbage springs the havana perfecto . with its gold and crimson band .
we could not speak , but there was no occasion ; he was willing to talk for [location] all . for he had just seen [male] and was in high spirits about it . [male] had told him about our trip to [location] . and he had begged [male] to take him a journey . and [male] had promised , it was to be a far journey .
[female] to await instructions , and [female] was placed in a new quandary . he knew not whether the small bedroom in the suite was for a child . or for his wife 's maid , or for his valet . quite probably it would be a sacrilegious defiance of precedent to put a valet in the small bedroom . quite probably wilkins 's had a floor for private valets in the roof .
and now , o kind hearted reader , i feel myself constrained , in the telling of this little story . to depart altogether from those principles of story telling to which you probably have become accustomed . and to put the horse of my romance before the cart . there is a mystery respecting mr. and mrs. peacocke which . according to all laws recognised in such matters , ought not to be elucidated till .
their journey thenceforward lay in the same direction . and the gentleman accepted [male] as his comrade . they discoursed of various matters , and , in a short time . rodaja gave such proof of his quality as much delighted his fellow traveller . while the latter , on his part , soon proved himself to be a kind and courteous man .
but hedda had to have this trip , auntie ! she really had to . nothing else would have done , no no , i suppose not , a wedding tour seems to be quite indispensable nowadays. . but tell me now -- have you gone thoroughly over the house yet ? yes , you may be sure i have , i have been afoot ever since daylight . i am delighted , quite delighted , only i can not think what we are to do with the two empty rooms between this inner parlour and hedda 's bedroom .
what should he do to the man ? as for answering the letter . that was of course out of the question ; but the reptile would carry out his threat of publishing the letter . and then the whole question of his marriage would be discussed in the public prints . an idea came across him that a free press was bad and rotten from the beginning to the end . this creature was doing him a terrible injury .
he preferred literature to the plaudits of the nobility and the sedentary life on a big white oak throne . on the night before his coronation his pillow was wet with tears . and in the midst of it all here came the danes wearing heavy woollen clothes and introducing their justly celebrated style of honest sweat . [male] fought as many as eight battles with them in one year . they agreed at last to accept such portions of the country as were assigned them .
the scene worked out so well that his mind became a little above itself . it suggested developments of serpentine craftiness . why not get [male] nichols to write him a letter about his uncle [male] and the five millions ? [male] liked doing that sort of thing . he would do it like a shot .
notwithstanding all this he still hankers after her and swears she shall be his , he is not a bad looking fellow . and from what we know of the market , we should say there are plenty of other girls who would jump at him . yet for the sake of settling down with this dismal young female as his wife . he is prepared to go through a laborious and exhaustive course of crime and to be bullied and insulted by every one he meets . his love sustains him under it all .
there are some things of which the world does not like to be reminded , for they are the dead loves of the world . one of these is that great enthusiasm for the arcadian life which , however much it may now lie open to the sneers of realism . did , beyond all question , hold sway for an enormous period of the world 's history . from the times that we describe as ancient down to times that may fairly be called recent . the conception of the innocent and hilarious life of shepherds and shepherdesses certainly covered and absorbed the time of theocritus .
but in the daytime it was a settee and nothing but a settee . there was no space for a great deal of furniture . there was one rocking chair , two ordinary chairs , a table . a book stand , a typewriter -- nobody uses pens in [location] . and on the walls a mixed collection of photographs .
`` that , '' she said , pointing to the picture -- a rather vivid chromo entitled . [female] blessing little children ', and i was just imagining i was one of them -- that i was the little girl in the blue dress . standing off by herself in the corner as if she did not belong to anybody , like me . she looks lonely and sad , do not you think ? i guess she had not any father or mother of her own .
when i reached the university place . i saw two gentlemen talking together , and , as they had portfolios under their arms . i judged they were tutors or elderly students . so i asked them in english to show me the college jail . i had learned to take it for granted that anybody in [location] who knows anything .
from the open windows of the chapel she could hear the college chanting . `` lord , have mercy upon us , and incline our hearts to keep this law . '' she laughed happily to herself ; she was not keeping laws today . they might stay in there in the gloom , if they wanted to . with their commandments and their litanies , she was worshiping under the blue sky .
chauncey worked along these lines until he was twenty-four . and then he made a mistake , most of the girls that he had grown up with had married off . and while he was waiting for a new lot to come along , he began to shine up to the widow sharpless . a powerful , well-preserved woman of forty or thereabouts . who had been born with her eye teeth cut , he found her uncommon sympathetic .
[female] tiptoed away , and hurried back to the castle , never before had she so clearly realized what a handicap an adhesive family can be to a young girl . at the moment of lord [location] 's arrival . [female] was reading a letter from billie dore . which had come by that morning 's post , it dealt mainly with the vicissitudes experienced by miss dore 's friend . miss sinclair , in her relations with the man [male] gray .
at the time when i first made his acquaintance he was the editor and moving spirit of the nation . it was a curious office , and i can recall many whom i first met there who have since come more or less prominently to the front in public life . there was mr. [male] , whom my friend `` toby '' has since christened `` windbag [male] '' in his parliamentary reports , mr. [male] then presided over the scissors and paste department of the journals owned by mr. [male] . and , unlike the posing orator he afterwards became .
but the reality to which he woke was worse still , tipping and coker had been patiently pinching themselves to keep awake until their enemy should be soundly asleep . in order to enjoy the exquisite pleasure of letting down the mattress . and , too dazed and frightened even to swear , paul gathered up his bedclothes and tried to draw them about him as well as he might . and seek sleep , which had lost its security , the garudâ stone had done one grim and cruel piece of work at least in its time . once more mr. [male] rose betimes , dressed noiselessly , and stole down to the cold schoolroom .
to say that [female] traversed this grisly place without any emotion would be putting forth falsehood . on the contrary , he was much affected , and the stout fellow only went up the obscure lanes . where his corporation took up all the width , with the utmost precaution . his eye skinned , and his finger on his revolver trigger . in the same manner as he went to the clubhouse at [location] .
if you hand it to her with the flower pointing upward it means . `` dare i hope ? '' reversed , it signifies . `` your petticoat shows about an inch , or an inch and a half . '' if she receives the plant in her right hand . it means , `` i am '' ; left hand .
`` c'est fini , '' he said ; and print can not convey the pensive scorn of his voice . it [male] , in his exalted mood . like a blow , finished , was it ? all right . now he would show them , they had asked for it . and now they should get it , how much did it come to ?
getting dripping to his feet , with the water up to his knees . the worshipper of force and victory waded disconsolately to the other side and drew himself on to the bank . and [male] sat down on the grass and went off into reverberations of laughter . a second afterwards the most extraordinary grimaces were seen to distort the stiff face of [male] . and unholy sounds came from within , he had never practised laughing .
by that time the real estate agent had fixed the tire . and we drove away , the man with the sampson suspenders was looking rather contemptuously at his flock of sheep . they would never get to [location] , i can not remember now just why we did not buy only nine hundred dollars down but somehow or other the decision of the council went against it . our attention at present is fastened on a place over in [location] called one man farm equipped . this , like so many of the attractive bargains in the advertisements , belongs to a widow .
and if you had looked at the steamer from the shore or from one of the islands . you would have seen the row of lights from the cabin windows shining on the water and the red glare of the burning hemlock from the funnel . and you would have heard the soft [location] of the propeller miles away over the lake . now and then , too , you could have heard them singing on the steamer . the voices of the girls and the men blended into unison by the distance .
argüello , who had seen her new flame in the hands of the officers . ran directly to the prison with some dinner for him . but she was not permitted to see him , this was a great grief to her . but she did not lose her hopes for all that , after the lapse of a fortnight the wounded man was out of danger . and in a week more , the surgeon pronounced him cured .
so the best way would be for [location] to pick out two or three things from the list and say we would not [male] them any more . then he reckoned it would not be no harm to [male] the others . so we talked it over all one night . drifting along down the river , trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons . or the cantelopes , or the mushmelons , or what , but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory .
no , i mean fond of discussing war ; and fond of giving military advice . if i had been with jameson the morning after he started . i should have advised him to turn back , that was monday ; it was then that he received his first warning from a boer source not to violate the friendly soil of the transvaal . it showed that his invasion was known , if i had been with him on tuesday morning and afternoon . when he received further warnings , i should have repeated my advice .
i found him on the veranda of his house . stretched out on a chair and suffering greatly , he received me fairly well . at first he examined me silently , piercing me with his two feline eyes . then a kind of malicious smile spread over his features . which were rather hard , finally he declared to me that all the attendants he had ever engaged in his service had not been worth a button .
considering everything , pop acted quite mild , i met a kid up at the lake in [location] who had skin diving equipment . he let me use it one day when mom and pop were off sight-seeing . boy , this has fishing beat hollow ! i found out there 's a skin diving course at the you . and i am going to begin saving up for the fins and mask and stuff .
all the battle horses agreed on this , a little after that we dispersed . and twenty-four hours later the vote was taken and to my intense surprise the riding was carried by grouch the conservative candidate . i say , to my surprise , but apparently not to anybody else . for it appeared this that grouch was a man of extraordinary magnetism . he had , so they said , `` punch . ''
in this way mr. [male] came definitely and clearly to a conclusion in his own mind . but it was very different with dr. wortle , the story so disturbed him . that during the whole of that afternoon he did not attempt to turn his mind to any other subject . he even went so far as to send over to mr. [male] and asked for some assistance for the afternoon service on the following day . he was too unwell , he said , to preach himself .
since then , everything had gone splendidly with [male] , for he had just accomplished his ambition of the moment by completing the negotiations for the purchase of a site further down town . on which he proposed to erect a new hotel , he liked building hotels . he had the cosmopolis , his first born , a summer hotel in the mountains . purchased in the previous year , and he was toying with the idea of running over to england and putting up another in [location] . that , however , would have to wait , meanwhile , he would concentrate on this new one down town .
[male] pushed his way through the spectators . somebody plucked him by the sleeve . he looked down , it was old mrs. [female] . `` delighted to see you again , mr. [female] , '' she said in her rich , husky voice , she panted a little as she spoke .
we will go round by that gate . my good sir , if you please , i am one of your sportsmen who rides at his ease . and i do not care to trouble my courser to jump , for whenever he does i fall off in a lump . then haste to the meet , the old [male] shall find . if i do not go precisely as fast as the wind , if they will give my bucephalus time to take breath .
they inherited all that the devoted care of that declining band of original ones could leave them . their little country was quite safe , their farms and gardens were all in full production . such industries as they had were in careful order . the records of their past were all preserved , and for years the older women had spent their time in the best teaching they were capable of . that they might leave to the little group of sisters and mothers all they possessed of skill and knowledge .
in this stately chair would he sit , and this magnificent pipe would he smoke . shaking his right knee with a constant motion , and fixing his eye for hours together upon a little print of amsterdam . which hung in a black frame against the opposite wall of the council chamber . nay , it has even been said , that when any deliberation of extraordinary length and intricacy was on the carpet . the renowned wouter would shut his eyes for full two hours at a time .
at ten o'clock the following morning my telephone bell rang and a visitor was announced . i did not catch the name given me . and it was only when i opened the door to him in response to his ring that i recognized mr. cullen . in morning clothes , which consisted in his case of a blue [male] suit that needed brushing and a bowler hat of extinct shape . he seemed to me , if possible , a little more objectionable than i had found him the previous night .
there is no art , no skill , required for that sort of thing . it shows pluck , but that is all , no ; your accomplished angler would scorn to tell a lie , that way . his method is a study in itself . because i about expect anybody would believe me if i did , replies the old fellow calmly , and without even a tinge of bitterness in his tone .
he perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike . emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting . he was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions . less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected . his ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer .
i have never taken much interest in german songs since then . we reached sunbury lock at half past three . the river is sweetly pretty just there before you come to the gates . and the backwater is charming ; but person t attempt to row up it . we sculled up to person , a rather large place for a riverside town .
i intended to mention casually dr. law , of the latter place . who acted as my physician for a few months and coaxed me back from the great hereafter . i had been under the hands of a physician just before , who was also coroner . and who , i found afterward , was trying to treat me professionally as long as the lamp held out to [male] . intending afterward to sit upon me officially , he had treated me professionally until he was about ready to summon his favorite coroner 's jury .
she swept among them , her own intrinsic radiance was not all that flashed from her . she was a moving reflector and refractor of all the rays of all the eyes that mankind had turned on her . her mien told the story of her days . bright eyes , light feet -- she trod erect from a vista whose glare was dazzling to all beholders . she swept among them , a miracle .
mr. [male] was telling the house all about black plaster . and gave three points why it should not be used in public hospitals . with the third point he landed a blow at home rule . and his ingenuity in doing so brought forth a derisive cheer from the irish benches . which roused my neighbour , i looked up at him smiling .
genuine and remarkable cures have been achieved through contact with the relics of a saint . is it not likely that any other bones would have done as well if the substitution had been concealed from the patient ? when i was a boy , a farmer 's wife who lived five miles from our village . had great fame as a faith doctor -- that was what she called herself . sufferers came to her from all around , and she laid her hand upon them and said .
i have called him a villain . i will never cease to call him a genius . for by some marvellous capacity for introspection , by some incredible projection of his own mind into other people 's matters . he was able to tax me to my face with an attempt to win his former fiancee's affections . i tried to choke him off , i used every ounce of bluff i possessed , in vain .
`` what do you mean , [female] ? '' she begged . purposely dense , and with wonderful control of her eyes . there was a gleam in his eyes that made her pose of indifference difficult . the fervor of his half whispered words took possession of her . she had expected sentiment of such a different character that his [female] confession disarmed her completely .
he was too absorbed , before him lay a pile of blue papers with printed headings . from time to time he turned them over in his hands and replaced them on the table with a groan . to the earl they meant ruin . absolute , irretrievable ruin , and with it the loss of his stately home that had been the pride of the oxheads for generations . more than that -- the world would now know the awful secret of his life .
i puts it on his head for him . him not saying a word but just staring about him kind of null and void . and now and then shivering slightly ; and as he goes down the [male] towards the elevator he 's got one hand sort of pressed up against the wall for to support him on his way . if i would been him i should a went right straight on home and laid down for a spell . probably that 's what he did do , i know i ai not seen hair nor hide of him since and i ai not expecting to do so .
archie sighed , and braced himself to the task once more . he wished he had never taken on this binge . in addition to his physical discomfort , he was feeling a most awful chump . the cover on which mr. [male] was engaged was for the august number of the magazine . and it had been necessary for archie to drape his reluctant form in a two piece bathing suit of a vivid lemon colour .
in less than fifteen minutes , the test under preparation had been canceled . all equipment secured and the first assault waves of scientists . soldiers , intelligence and security men were racing north behind white suited and sealed radiation detection teams cradling geiger counters in their arms like submachine guns . telephone lines were jammed with calls from [organization] field officials reporting the phenomena to [location] and calling for aid from [location] and [location] aec bases . jet fighters at nellis air force base near [location] .
now , as this knight one day was pricking wearily along a toilsome road , his heart misgave him and was sore within him because of the trouble of the way . rocks , dark and of a monstrous size . hung high above his head , and like enough it seemed unto the knight that they should fall and he lie low beneath them . chasms there were on either side , and darksome caves wherein fierce robbers lived . and dragons , very terrible , whose jaws dripped blood .
it is an unfortunate fact that , when a powder magazine explodes . the damage is not confined to the person who struck the match . but extends to the innocent bystanders , in the present case it was [female] who sustained the worst injuries . of the others who might have been affected , mrs. [female] was bomb proof , no explosion in her neighbourhood could shake her . she received the news of [organization] 's outbreak with composure .
i kno youll be glad to kno my feet aint hurtin so much , remember me to the hired girl and your mother . when i use french words ill underline them . thatll give you some idea of the languige . when we get voila as the french say for over there itll come handy to be able to sit down and have a dosy dos with them poilus . ( that means chew the rag in english , ) a poilus mable is a french peasant girl an they say that they are very belle .
i picketed the great embankments thrown up around our lines by the dynamite explosion . merely a lookout of a couple of boys to announce the enemy when he should appear again . next , i sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond our lines on the south . to turn a mountain brook that was there , and bring it within our lines and under our command . arranging it in such a way that i could make instant use of it in an emergency .
up there we found a fairly comfortable hotel , the property of an indiscriminate and incoherent landlord . who looks after nothing , but leaves everything to his army of indian servants . no , he does look after the bill -- to be just to him . and the tourist can not do better than follow his example , i was told by a resident that the summit of kinchinjunga is often hidden in the clouds . and that sometimes a tourist has waited twenty two days and then been obliged to go away without a sight of it .
in the crown of his cap were the furies and fates . and an elegant map of the dorian states : and we found in his palms . which were hollow , what are common in palms -- that is dates . but he is a rare bird , the confirmed cribber . with his algebraical formula written on his finger nails , and history notes attached to unreliable elastic arrangements which shoot up his sleeve out of reach at critical moments .
i noticed that my glass was again filled , and bowing an acknowledgment of his compliment . i indulged in another sip of the delicious wine . i sighed , for i began to realise it was going to be very difficult for me . in spite of my disclaimer , to tell this man 's friend he had stolen the money . all this time he had been sitting on the edge of the table .
`` oh , let me think , '' she said , half turning from him and pressing her hand to her brow . she hesitated , demanded a definition of the truce . and at last agreed , they mounted , and rode on in silence . through the sunlight and the heather , both were extremely uncomfortable and disappointed , she was pale . divided between fear and anger , she perceived she was in a scrape .
16 , while the chess player was in possession of baron kempelen . it was more than once observed , first , that an italian in the suite of the baron was never visible during the playing of a game at chess by the turk . and , secondly , that the italian being taken seriously ill , the exhibition was suspended until his recovery . this italian professed a total ignorance of the game of chess . although all others of the suite played well , similar observations have been made since the automaton has been purchased by maelzel .
in view of this painful possibility , i will not appeal indignantly to my other writings as a proof that i am incapable of such a deed . i will not point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself . to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it , or to its noble teachings in natural history . i will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened . the bellman , who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances , used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished .
you are a very fine fellow , sir . [female] . i am generally admired , queen , i can quite understand it . now here is a man whose physical attributes are simply godlike , that man has a most extraordinary effect upon me . if i yielded to a natural impulse , i should fall down and worship that man . but i mortify this inclination ; i wrestle with it , and it lies beneath my feet !
[male] was feeling embarrassed , he looked at mr sheppherd . and with difficulty restrained himself from standing on one leg and twiddling his fingers . at one period of his career , before the influence of his uncle [male] had placed him in the [location] and suburban bank . owen had been an actor , on the strength of a batting average of thirty three point nought seven for middlesex . he had been engaged by the astute musical comedy impresario to whom the idea first occurred that .
as a matter of fact the strike collapsed peacefully without any outside intervention . the majority of the keepers had become so attached to their charges that they returned to work of their own accord . and then the nation and the newspapers turned with a sense of relief to happier things . it seemed as if a new era of contentment was about to dawn . everybody had struck who could possibly want to strike or who could possibly be cajoled or bullied into striking .
this was too much my dear [male] , for i am certain that he had the impudence by that look . of pretending to suspect the reality of mine , but you i am sure will vindicate my character whenever you may hear it so cruelly aspersed . for you can witness how often i have protested against wearing rouge , and how much i always told you i disliked it . and i assure you that my opinions are still the same. . well , not bearing to be so suspected by my brother , i left the room immediately .
the efficient baxter returned to the museum without a word . ashe , standing in the middle of the room . was impressing the topography of the place on his memory . he was unaware of the piercing stare of suspicion that was being directed at him from behind . he did not see baxter , he was not even thinking of baxter .
also , we had with [location] the elderly gentleman of impaired disposition . who had crossed thirty times before and was now completing his thirty first trip , and getting madder and madder about it every minute . i saw him only with his clothes on . but i should say , speaking offhand , that he had at least fourteen rattles and a button . his poison sacs hung way down .
the fare was thirty centimes -- or , say , three cents . after paying my fare and finding that i still had money left . i lunched at st , cloud in the open air at a trifling expense . i then took a bottle of milk from my pocket and quenched my thirst . traveling through person one finds that the water is especially bad , tasting of the dauphin at times .
so they spent a good deal of their time around the rusty stove in the dilapidated tavern at angel 's camp . it seemed a profitless thing to do , but few experiences were profitless to mark twain . and certainly this one was not , at this barren mining hotel there happened to be a former illinois river pilot named [male] . a solemn , sleepy person , who dozed by the stove or told slow . pointless stories to any one who would listen , not many would stay to hear him .
ladies and gentlemen in evening dress were already entering . they looked inquiringly about and chose tables , those next to the dancing space were quickly filled . many of the ladies permitted costly wraps of fur or brocade to spill across the backs of their chairs . many of the gentlemen lighted cigarettes from gleaming metal cases . there was a lively interchange of talk , `` we better light up , too , ''
mr [male] , purple in the face . made a last effort , the young man tottered back to his gentlemanly colleagues . running a finger in an agitated manner round the inside of his collar . he was not used to this sort of thing . in a large experience of amateur theatricals he had never encountered anything like it .
the great deeps of a boundless forest have a beguiling and impressive charm in any country . but german legends and fairy tales have given these an added charm . they have peopled all that region with gnomes . and dwarfs , and all sorts of mysterious and uncanny creatures . at the time i am writing of , i had been reading so much of this literature that sometimes i was not sure but i was beginning to believe in the gnomes and fairies as realities .
five minutes later they come running back ; the one has forgotten her parasol . the other her purse , and speaking of purses . reminds one of another essential difference between the male and female human animal . a man carries his money in his pocket . when he wants to use it , he takes it out and lays it down .
his friend comes with him , also the dog of his friend . the dog is welcomed with enthusiasm ; all balls are returned to the dog . until the dog is tired you do not get a look in . but all this will no doubt soon be changed , there are some excellent french and belgian players . from them their compatriots will gradually learn higher ideals .
this effort had cost him his job and a thrashing from his father . but it had been worth it , it was . however , merely the crude attempt of a child . it was one of the chambermaids , a rosy cheeked girl recently up from the country . who gave bindle the idea he had been seeking , as he was unscrewing the numbers with all the elaborate caution of a burglar .
their mysteries were of a somewhat unpleasant character , as far as we know them . the candidate had to pass a long time almost starved , and without any enjoyment whatever . was then let into a dark temple , crowned with olive , tied round with a purple girdle . and frightened almost to death with horrid noises , terrible sights of some kind . great flashes of light and deep darkness between .
there was considerable jawing back , so i slid out , thinking maybe there was going to be trouble . the streets was full , and everybody was excited , everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened . and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows , stretching their necks and listening . one long , lanky man , with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head . and a crooked handled cane , marked out the places on the ground where boggs stood and where sherburn stood .
he was too shadowy a mark , besides , he was dead . the whole current of her wrath turned upon the supplanter , this lord [female] . she pictured him as a crafty adventurer . a wretched fortune hunter , for some reason or other she imagined him a sinister person with a black moustache . a face thin and hawk like , and unpleasant eyes , that was the sort of man who would be likely to fasten his talons into poor uncle ira .
there was an old man of corfu , who never knew what he should do . so he rushed up and down , till the sun made him brown . that bewildered old man of corfu , there was an old man of vesuvius . who studied the works of [male] ; when the flames burnt his book . to drinking he took , that morbid old man of vesuvius .
a coal mine is a dreadful thing at a dinner table . it humbles one so before one 's guests , it would not have been so bad . this mrs. [organization] herself admitted . if mr. [organization] did anything , this phrase should be clearly understood . it meant if there was any one thing that he did .
so presently we came back home , and i spent many busy days in fixing and arranging our new house . i had the drawing room done in blue . and the dining room all in dark panelled wood . and a boudoir upstairs done in pink and white enamel to match my bedroom and dressing room . there was a very nice little room in the basement next to the coal cellar that i turned into a `` den '' for [male] .
it rose again , with a jubilant ring . and mingled itself with the country songs and dances of the peasants assembled in the convent [male] to cheer up the rescued huntsman while he ate his supper . the instruments imitated all these sounds with a marvelous exactness . more than one man started to raise his umbrella when the storm burst forth and the sheets of mimic rain came driving by . it was hardly possible to keep from putting your hand to your hat when the fierce wind began to rage and shriek .
ye winds that have made me your sport . convey to this desolate shore some cordial endearing report of a land i shall visit no more ! how fleet is a glance of the mind ! compared with the speed of its flight , the tempest itself lags behind . and the swift winged arrows of light , when i think of my own native land .
that was a mistake of large dimensions , the old masters were still unpleasing to me . but they were truly divine contrasted with the copies , the copy is to the original as the pallid . smart , inane new wax work group is to the vigorous , earnest , dignified group of living men and women whom it professes to duplicate . there is a mellow richness , a subdued color , in the old pictures . which is to the eye what muffled and mellowed sound is to the ear .
can you do me a coat ? what cloth will you do to ? from a stuff what be of season . how much wants the ells for coat , waist coat , and breeches , six ells . what will you to double the coat ? from some thing of duration . i believe to you that when do you bring me my coat ?
he put the key into the lock . and turned it , the door resisted for a while . but soon came stiffly open ; mingling with the sense of fever in his mouth . a taste of rust , and dust . and earth , and rotting wood , he looked out , passed out .
during the game of duck pins , a juvenile form of bowling . paul was silent , as they came down the steps of the club . not more than half an hour after the time at which babbitt had sternly told miss [male] he would be back . paul sighed , look here , old man . ought not to talked about zilla way i did .
`` i do not know , i shall have to think about it , '' gombauld loosened his embrace . his hand dropped from her shoulder , `` be careful going down the ladder , '' he added solicitously , [male] looked round , startled . they were in front of the open door . she remained standing there for a moment in bewilderment .
lord [female] recalls another familiar figure i caricatured . lord iddesleigh , a statesman who will always be remembered with respect . no statue has ever been erected in the buildings of [organization] to any member who better deserves it . and , strange to say , the white marble took the character and style of the man . chilliness , pure , and firm .
she was delighted to hear this , and bestowed a kind glance upon mark . which he brought his eyes down from the fog to encounter and received with immense satisfaction . she said in his hearing , too , that he was a good soul and a merry creature . and would be faithful , she was certain ; commendations which mr tapley inwardly resolved to deserve . from such lips , if he died for it .
i hardly know how to advise you , adelbert , you have got yourself into a place where you can not do much but remain and take your medicine . unfortunately , there are too many such young men as you are , adelbert , you are young . and handsome , and smart , you casually admit this in your letter , i see . you have a social nature , and would shine in society . you also reluctantly confess this , that does not help you in my estimation , adelbert .
examination of the correspondence between these two men shows wiglaf to have been simply a great . big hearted , overgrown boy in the whole affair , all claims of his having had an eye on the throne of [location] fade away under the delightful ingenuousness of his attitude as expressed in these letters . shortly after this letter was written , wiglaf ascended the throne of mercia . his father having disappeared saturday night without trace . a peasant some years after said that he met the old king walking along a road near what is now the scottish border .
there are many affairs of great moment which i have not enumerated in this brief letter . because i felt some little delicacy and timidity about appearing to be at all dictatorial or officious about a matter wherein the public might charge me with interference . i hope you will receive the foregoing in a friendly spirit . and whatever your convictions may be upon great questions of national interest . either foreign or domestic , that you will not undertake to blow out the gas on retiring .
the ladies had left the room and the port was circulating . mr. [male] filled his glass , passed on the decanter . and , leaning back in his chair , looked about him for a moment in silence . the conversation rippled idly round him , but he disregarded it . he was smiling at some private joke , gombauld noticed his smile .
a severe looking old lady then enters the room , you rise and bow . `` i am miss doe 's grandmother , some one has been smoking in here , '' she says , and sits down opposite you , her remark is not . however , a hint for a cigaret and you should not make the mistake of saying . `` i have only got fatimas , but if you care to try one -- '' it should be your aim to seek to impress yourself favorably upon every member of the young lady 's family .
after leaving [location] , and for a far-reaching run , the railway skirts the riverlawrence . of which we get glimpses near and far as we pass . the time is not far distant when this mighty river will be frozen to the distance of fully a mile out . and men may skate where atlantic steamers sail , at present the river is free . but the frost comes like a thief in the night , and the wary shipmasters have already gone into winter quarters .
to say the truth , this behaviour of partridge was a little inexcusable . but he had not slept off the effect of the dose which he swallowed the evening before . which had , in the morning , received the addition of above a pint of wine . or indeed rather of malt spirits ; for the perry was by no means pure . now , that part of his head which nature designed for the reservoir of drink being very shallow .
when i do , he 's not in sight . and the janitor tells me he jumped up on the wall and probably down into one of the other yards . i look around a while and call , but he 's not in sight . and i go up to lunch , along toward evening cat scratches at the door and comes in . as if he would done it all his life .
[female] possessed that extraordinary facility for vivid acting which is the great native gift of his race . and he enchained his listeners , they sat fascinated and spellbound . [male] , tell that again , said penrod , breathlessly , [male] , nothing loath . accepted the encore and repeated the miltonic episode , expanding it somewhat . and dwelling with a fine art upon those portions of the narrative which he perceived to be most exciting to his audience .
but the shouts and shrieks were disregarded , the wailings moved no pity . the clawing and scratching was of no avail . for all was lost upon the loneliness of the spot , the silence of the night . and the cruel hearts of the ravishers . finally , the one party went off exulting , and the other was left in desolation and woe .
he was about to go away south , into [location] , with the view of pushing his fortune there with certain desperadoes . who were maintaining a perpetual war against the authorities of [location] on the borders of [location] . and he demanded that his wife should accompany him . this she refused to do , and violence was used to force her . then it came to pass that certain persons inlouis interfered on her behalf .
georgie 's christmas party had just taken its seats at his round rosewood table without a cloth . and he hoped that foljambe would be quick with the champagne . because there had been rather a long wait before dinner , owing to [male] and peppino being late . and conversation had been a little jerky , [female] , as usual . had sailed into the room , without a word of apology .
what i wrote attracted some attention , so the german government -- feeling , perhaps . that the prestige of their own spy system was at stake . published a white paper , -- or a green paper , -- i forget which . in denial of all my adventures and disclosures . in this they proved that all entry into [location] by dreams had been expressly forbidden of the high general command .
he now limped away into the back garden , where he picked a new pair of boots that would not hurt his feet . and while he was gone the dog began to fall down again , of course he fell faster than he went up . and finally landed with a crash exactly on the king 's door step . but so great was the force of the fall and so hard the door step that the poor dog was flattened out like a pancake . and could not move a bit , `` hullo , some kind friend has brought me a new door mat as a present , ''
she is a dear old lady and not a bit prudish . but we are sure she would never approve of whooping the pot on a king and an ace and a seven spot . then take the debatable question of two pairs , personally we have always believed in raising on them before the draw . such a procedure is dangerous , perhaps , but profitable in the long run , under the [male] system it might be difficult to take the larger viewpoint . it is more than possible that we would grow timorous if cousin susie 's hope of a comfortable old age rested upon eights and deuces .
indeed diff are nt is essentially a reflection of the other play . in which [male] states again in other terms his theory that man is invariably overthrown by the very factor in life which he seeks to escape . emma of diff are nt , like the emperor [female] . completes a great circle in her frantic efforts to escape and , after refusing a young man . because of a single fall from grace , comes thirty years after to be an eager and unhappy spinster who throws herself at the head of a young rascal .
either [location] is healthier than [location] , notwithstanding her `` deadly '' indulgence in ice water . or she does not keep the run of her death rate as sharply as [location] does . i think we do keep up the death statistics accurately . and if we do , our cities are healthier than the cities of [location] . every month the german government tabulates the death rate of the world and publishes it .
old gabe shook hands with philo and went out . when the door was closed behind him he chuckled . and all the way home his face was creased in a grin . he felt that he had done a good bit of business and saved himself a good sum of money . philo gubb , in the meantime .
he had again tried to pull himself together and approach the doctor with his protest . but no sooner did he find himself near his presence than his heart began to leap wildly and then retired down towards his boots . leaving him hoarse , palpitating , and utterly blank of ideas . it was no use -- and he resigned himself for yet another day of unwelcome instruction . the class was in a little room on the basement floor .
he bit a large piece out of the apple . which he still held , [male] uttered a piercing scream as he saw the mouthful disappear . up till now he had shown no signs of dismay . in spite of the peril which he had had to face . but when he watched [male] eating the apple .
when swift was a year old , an event happened to him that seems very unusual . for his nurse , who was a woman of whitehaven . being under the absolute necessity of seeing one of her relations , who was then extremely sick . and from whom she expected a legacy ; and being extremely fond of the infant . she stole him on shipboard unknown to his mother and uncle .
the sailor hastened with rapid steps to his house . which stood on the quay , whence could be seen the northern ocean . of which he seemed so proud , [male] had amassed a comfortable sum at his calling . after having long commanded the vessels of a rich shipowner of havre . he had settled down in his native town , where he had caused the brig `` jeune hardie '' to be constructed at his own expense .
from these and other sources , penrod found no difficulty in compiling material for what came to be known as the `` rixual '' . and it was the rixual he was reading to the members when mrs. [female] happened to observe the ceremonial raising of the emblem of the order . the rixual contained the oath , a key to the secret language . or code ( devised by penrod for use in uncertain emergencies ) . and passwords for admission to the shack .
the boy is materially inclined -- the mourning [location] professor has discovered it . i did not want to be an idealist living up a back street , i wanted to live in the biggest house in the best street of the town . i wanted to ride a horse , wear a fur coat . and have as much to eat and drink as ever i liked , i wanted to marry the most beautiful woman in the world . to have my name in the newspaper , and to know that everybody was envying me .
i tells him the onlyest [male] of color i remembers is an old man which he does janiting for the first national bank . and he speaks up very prompt and says that 's his uncle which he is named for him and used to live with him out by the [location] central shops . he says he really do not blame me so much for not placing him . because he left there it 's going on eight or nine years ago just before the big high water . but he claims he used to meet me frequent .
after eating it , pepperleigh had the common sense to realize that it was sheer madness to destroy a hotel that could cook a thing like that . in the same way , the secretary of [organization] was silenced with a stuffed duck a la ossawippi . three members of [organization] were converted with a dindon farci a la josh [male] . and then , finally , mr. [male] persuaded dean drone to come . and as soon as mr. [male] and [male] saw him they landed him with a fried flounder that even the apostles would have appreciated .
thus the future of which we spoke at the beginning has always been the ally of tyranny . the ordinary englishman has been duped out of his old possessions , such as they were . and always in the name of progress , the destroyers of the abbeys took away his bread and gave him a stone . assuring him that it was a precious stone . the white pebble of the lord 's elect .
she is the wife of the other man . just what there is , for the reader , about other men 's wives . i do not understand , i know tons of them that i would not walk round a block for . but the reading public goes wild over them . the old-fashioned heroine was unmarried , that spoiled the whole story , you could see the end from the beginning .
it was the custom of the ladies at mrs. [female] 's to stroll about the lovely rural walks after dinner and until twilight . and on this particular evening they departed in twos and threes . leaving me to make my apology without witnesses . i was rather sorry they went ; it was not pleasant to feel that i was principally responsible for my nephews blunder , and to have no opportunity to allay my conscience pangs by conversation .
the glass blower was much distressed at this , but said he would see what he could do . for a man should always try to please his wife , and miss mydas has promised to marry him within a week . on his way home he purchased a heavy sack . and when he passed the wizard 's door and the pink glass dog ran out to bark at him he threw the sack over the dog . tied the opening with a piece of twine .
hereupon the burgomaster himself came forward , and in a sublime harangue made short work of those pusillanimous people who disguise their fear under a veil of prudence . which veil he tore off with a patriotic hand , at this sally it seemed as if the [male] would fall in under the applause . the vote was eagerly demanded , and was taken amid acclamations , the cries of to virgamen , to virgamen ! ', redoubled . the burgomaster then took it upon himself to put the armies in motion . and in the name of the town he promised the honours of a triumph .
the woodcutter found the bear lying in the forest . at first he was much frightened , but the bear lay remarkably still , so the woodman crept nearer . ventured to kick the bear -- very gently , ready to run if need be . surely the bear was dead , and parts of a bear are good to eat . and [male] to poor woodfolk on cold winter nights is grateful .
paul was too overcome at this unexpected favour to speak his thanks . he got away as soon as he could , his path was smoothed at last ! that afternoon the boys , or all of them who had disposed of the work set them for the day . were sitting in the schoolroom , after a somewhat chilly dinner of cold beef . cold tarts , and cold water , passing the time with that description of literature known as `` sunday reading . ''
wyatt took out his handkerchief and wiped his face , over which the succulent vegetable had spread itself . for the first five minutes it was as even a fight as one could have wished to see . it raged up and down the road without a pause . now in a solid mass , now splitting up into little groups , the science was on the side of the school . most wrykynians knew how to box to a certain extent , but , at any rate at first .
so i had to wipe myself with a newspaper which i happened to have in my pocket . and a more unsatisfactory thing to dry oneself upon i can not conceive . i woke up b. when i got back to the carriage . and persuaded him to go and have a wash ; and in listening to the distant sound of his remarks when he likewise discovered that there was no towel . the recollection of my own discomfiture passed gently away , ah ! how true it is .
takegeorge , for instance , do you imagine for a minute that his victory was honestly and fairly earned ? british pluck and all the rest of it had nothing to do with it . the dragon could have finished him off in a second , but the huge and kindly animal was afflicted with an acute sense of humor . between paroxysms it is known to have remarked : `` i shall certainly die laughing . '' it could not resist the sight ofgeorge swaggering up to the attack in full armor like an infuriated ford charging the woolworth building .
or as when two gentlemen , strangers to the wondrous wit of the place . are cracking a bottle together at some inn or tavern at salisbury . if the great dowdy , who acts the part of a madman as well as some of his setters on do that of a fool . should rattle his chains , and dreadfully hum forth the grumbling catch along the gallery . the frighted strangers stand aghast ; scared at the horrid sound , they seek some place of shelter from the approaching danger .
the annals of the game are studded with the names of those who have made rapid progress in their first season . [female] , we read in our vardon . took up golf at the age of fifty six . and by devising an ingenious machine consisting of a fishing line and a sawn down bedpost was enabled to keep his head so still that he became a scratch player before the end of the year . but no one , i imagine , except [male] .
that beautiful young lady will be here to claim you in half an hour . and i congratulate that one with all my heart , [female] , married when a baby , giu . but we were married three months ago , [female] one of you , only one . the other is an unintentional bigamist , gia , and tess . well , upon my word , [female] eh ?
she also carried a green parasol , she went with him to the edge of the lake . where a couple of boats were always moored ; they got into one of them . and [male] , with gentle strokes , propelled it to the opposite shore . the day was the perfection of summer weather . the little lake was the color of sunshine .
so it is always best to deal gently with the erring , especially if you think it will be fatal to them . the reformed lecturer also spoke of a discovery he made . which i had never heard of before , he began , during the closing years of his tour . to notice mysterious marks on his trunk , made with chalk generally . and so , during his leisure hours , he investigated them and their cause and effect .
an observant philosopher once pointed out that in every man there are embedded three men . first , the man as he appears to himself . second , the man as he appears to others . third , the man as he really is , this classification of points of view is particularly applicable to the scholastic world . listen , for instance , to master smith , describing to an admiring circle of sisters and young brothers a scene from school life as it is lived in the junior remove .
and so mr. [male] mounted his horse , and accompanied the old woman home . she lived rather over a mile from the meeting house . and the way was past the comfortable residence of mr. [male] . the latter did not feel altogether satisfied with himself as he rode home . he was not certain that the preacher had stayed at sister [male] 's the night before .
`` they are late , ai not they ? '' inquired her landlord . when she had conducted them downstairs into the kitchen . `` well , sir , considern '' the wings of love . they are , said mrs gamp . mr bailey inquired whether the wings of love had ever won a plate .
`` whew , '' cried [male] , slapping a little cloud of pipe clay out of his left leg . `` then he 's been and married the merry one , '' as these words were mysterious . mrs gamp called upon him to explain , which [male] proceeded to do . that lady listening greedily to everything he said , he was yet in the fullness of his narrative when the sound of wheels . and a double knock at the street door .
one day as she sat upon a low headland . looking earnestly out over the sparkling blue-green water before her , and hoping to discover the peak of some far-off sail on the hazy sea line . she was startled by a sound she had never heard before . the grating of a boat 's keel on the pebbles in the little creek at her side . she had been too much absorbed in watching for distant ships to notice that a small bark had been gliding round the other side of her island .
being a tidy man , he had acquired some skill with a needle in his bachelor days . with the intention of administering a rebuke to his wife . he set to work on the skirt during her absence and sewed it up neatly . when , on her return home , he showed her what he had done . she was touched and kissed him tenderly , soon she left the room .
so we shuddered there in silence , -- for the stoutest held his breath . while the hungry sea was roaring and the breakers talked with death . as thus we sat in darkness , each one busy with his prayers . `` we are lost , '' the [male] shouted as he staggered down the stairs . but his little daughter whispered , as she took his icy hand .
these could cease from their functions without affecting him , when he is well enough , he works . when he is incapacitated , his own people take care of him . and not in a poor and stingy way , but with a fine and large benevolence . his race is entitled to be called the most benevolent of all the races of men . a jewish beggar is not impossible , perhaps ; such a thing may exist , but there are few men that can say they have seen that spectacle .
he yawned now , thinking , instead of the anger expressions he should have been practising . of the sordid things he must do tomorrow . he must be up at five , sprinkle the floor , sweep it . take down the dust curtains from the shelves of dry goods . clean and fill the lamps , then station outside the dummies in their raiment .
but it made you seem sorrowfully trivial , and the creature of a day . and such a short and paltry day , too , and he did not say anything to raise up your drooping pride . no , not a word , he always spoke of men in the same old indifferent way . just as one speaks of bricks and manure piles and such things . you could see that they were of no consequence to him .
suddenly [female] had an inspiration , it was hopeless . she knew , to try to convince this poor demented creature , obsessed with his idee fixe . that she was not miss milliken , denial would be a waste of time . and might even infuriate him into precipitating the tragedy , it was imperative that she should humour him . and , while she was humouring him , it suddenly occurred to her .
when he is three inches off the bridge . he pulls himself up straight , and the brickwork . as the train dashes through , kills a fly that was trespassing on the upper part of his right ear . then , when the bridge is passed , and the train is skirting the very edge of a precipice . so that a stone dropped just outside the window would tumble straight down 300 feet .
madam , the slighted [male] is metamorphosed into [male] dennison . only son and heir of a gentleman . whose character is second to none in [location] . as you may understand upon inquiry , my guardian , my brother and i . are now in his house ; and an immediate union of the two families is to take place in the persons of the young gentleman and your poor lydia melford .
yet i purposely mixed that up with other things , hoping to make it obscure . and i did , i would describe the position of one foot . and then say his right thumb was against the side of his nose . then talk about his other foot , and presently come back and say the fingers of his right hand were spread apart . then talk about the back of his head a little , and return and say the left thumb was hooked into the right little finger .
and what is that ? asked his daughter , to becoming a leader in the busy world of leisure . my child , said [male] , falling back to his pillow once more . and again losing consciousness in sleep , this time fortunately the sleep was that of one who had fought a good fight . had lost , but whose conscience was clear ; and to whom , after many days . had been restored a sound mind in a body sound enough to last through many years of unremitting rest .
he found , in this curious series of imaginings . during the lesson in arithmetic , that the atmosphere may be navigated as by a swimmer under water . but with infinitely greater ease and with perfect comfort in breathing , in his mind he extended his arms gracefully . at a level with his shoulders , and delicately paddled the air with his hands . which at once caused him to be drawn up out of his seat and elevated gently to a position about midway between the floor and the ceiling .
before the end of that week mrs. [female] . who stood staunchly by ruth , and would not hear of her going alone , ruth herself . and a keen eyed maid -- not the one who had accompanied the young heiress home from [location] . but another supplied by mr. [male] -- all arrived at glenville . and took quarters at the glenville house .
it was at a charming little place between esher and cobham . where a bridge crosses a stream , that mr. [male] came across the other cyclist in brown . it is well to notice the fact here , although the interview was of the slightest . because it happened that subsequently [male] saw a great deal more of this other man in brown . the other cyclist in brown had a machine of dazzling newness .
`` long stalks , please , '' who , being commanded by his lady to bring in flowers for the house . has not received this warning ? and was there ever a stalk to equal the daffodil 's for length and firmness and beauty ? other flowers must have foliage to set them off . but daffodils can stand by themselves in a bowl . and their green and yellow dress brings all spring into the room .
he was shaken , and the clamlike stolidity which he had assumed as protection gave way . night had descended upon brookport , eustace , the monkey . was in his little bed ; lord wetherby in the smoking room , it was sunday . the day of rest , dinner was over . and the remainder of the party were gathered in the drawing room .
`` eustace is returning to england on saturday , '' said mrs. [female] . she spoke a little wistfully , she had not been parted from her son since he had come down from oxford . and she would have liked to keep him with her till the end of her lecturing tour . that , however , was out of the question , it was imperative that , while she was away . he should be at windles , nothing would have induced her to leave the place at the mercy of servants who might trample over the flowerbeds .
the acquaintance thus begun was continued , and the photographer found it very profitable to oblige his spiritual friend . by the reproduction of ghost like pictures , ad infinitum . at the rate of five dollar each , mothers came to the room of the artist . and gratefully retired with ghostly representations of departed little ones , widows came to purchase the shades of their departed husbands . husbands visited the photographer and procured the spectral pictures of their dead wives .
the observation was characteristic of [male] 's creed of life . he never emphasized the exceptions but always the big , fine , elemental good in everything . even the name by which he went had been bestowed on him by the community as a term of endearment . there were , to be sure , other men in the hamlet whose names had passed into diminutives . there was , for example , seth crocker , whose wife explained that she called him [organization] `` for short . ''
man , in a state of barbarity . equally cruel and indolent , active by necessity , but naturally inclined to repose , is acquainted with little more than the physical effects of love . and having none of those moral ideas which only can soften the empire of force . he is led to consider it as his supreme law . subjecting to his despotism those whom reason had made his equals .
there is a law throughout [location] -- an excellent law it is . i would we had it in england . that nobody may scatter paper about the street . an english military friend told me that , one day in dresden . unacquainted with this rule , he tore a long letter he had been reading into some fifty fragments and threw them behind him .
`` good god , '' cried freddie , he followed him . protesting weakly , but the other gave no sign that he had heard . freddie saw him disappear into the stage box , and , turning , found jill at his elbow . [male] had observed this for himself , and it had not helped him to face his task . lovely woman loses something of her queenly dignity when she puffs .
i put on my white trousers and wished to heaven that the sun would go under a cloud till i got used to [location] people without words just where my linen began and i left off . the rest o my outfit was white shoes that hurt . and white sox , and a two dollar silk shirt that showed up a zebra . and a red tie and a soft collar and a blue coat .
all of them have appealed to the imaginations of their patients . and no person acquainted with mental philosophy is ignorant that many a sick man has been cured either by medicine and imagination together . or by imagination alone , therefore , even if this [male] should really be the cause of the recovery of some persons from their ailments . it would be no more a miracle than if dr. [male] should do it . nor would [male] be any the less a quack and a humbug .
by ormsby i was never again molested ; in word and deed . he was true to the promise exacted from him during that last strange scene . at first , he avoided me as being too painfully connected with the past . but by degrees , as he recognised that his secret was safe in my keeping . we grew to understand one another better , although it would be too much to say that we ever became intimate .
[male] , after the first surprise , seemed to grasp the situation . ejaculating at intervals the words , `` who is that ? stop ! who is that , stop ! '' he dashed after the much enduring wrykynian at an extremely creditable rate of speed , mr . [male] was by way of being a sprinter . he had won handicap events at college sports at oxford .
for several weeks i had been culling all the information i could about [location] , from tourists . the tourists were all agreed upon one thing -- one must expect to be cheated at every turn by the italians . i took an evening walk in turin . and presently came across a little punch and judy show in one of the great squares . twelve or fifteen people constituted the audience .
he feels convinced every minute that the whole concern is going over . a conviction which becomes especially lively whenever a ditch or a stretch of newly macadamized road comes in sight . every vehicle that passes he expects is going to run into him . and he never finds himself ascending or descending a hill without immediately beginning to speculate upon his chances . supposing -- as seems extremely probable -- that the weak kneed controller of his destiny should let go .
-- and , oh , said [female] with an effort -- yet her voice was still gentle and her lips were smiling -- i think it 's argile 's where you can get those rompers , good by . it was not until she had reached the station and bought her ticket to [female] that [female] realized it was the first five minutes in six months that her mind had been off jeffrey . a week later [female] appeared at [female] . arrived unexpectedly at five o'clock , and coming up the walk sank into a porch chair in a state of exhaustion .
it is a thing of purely ceremonial swagger . one can not express the emotion in any way except by saying that a man feels more like a man with a stick in his hand . just as he feels more like a man with a sword at his side . but nobody ever had any swelling sentiments about an umbrella ; it is a convenience . like a door scraper , an umbrella is a necessary evil .
it was their ill fortune , at about the time of dawn and in the last stage of their journey . to have a restive pair of horses , these animals had been greatly terrified in their stable by the tempest . and coming out into the dreary interval between night and morning . when the glare of the lightning was yet unsubdued by day . and the various objects in their view were presented in indistinct and exaggerated shapes which they would not have worn by night .
i felt the excitement of it throbbing in my pulses . the gloomy , half lit auditorium seemed full of strange suggestions , i felt in real and actual touch with the great things that throbbed beneath . i was no longer an auditor -- a looker on , i had become a participator . as usual there was a block outside , and the few yards between [location] and the door seemed interminable . i had none of the optimism of those others .
at first he laughed in a good natured way at his awkwardness . and hung it up again carefully ; but at last he became irritated about it . and almost forgot himself enough to swear , but controlled himself , finding , however . that it refused to hang up , and that it seemed rather restless , anyhow , he put it in the corner of the [male] with the crown up . pinned it to the floor with his umbrella .
there are in [location] a number of merchants . bankers , brokers , and other persons eminent in the business world . and respectable in all social relations , who never make an important business move in any direction . until after consultation with one or another of the witches of [location] . there are many who are regular periodical customers , and who visit the shrine of the oracle once a month .
mr. [male] 's reply was not inaudible . for just at that moment he swallowed his coffee the wrong way . and in the effort to bring him to , the thread of the argument snapped . and up to the hour of going to press had not been tied together again . the idiot was very late at breakfast -- so extremely late , in fact .
it is the saddest spectacle in the world . that of the crowd collected by a wanted advertisement , they are so palpably not wanted by anyone for any purpose whatsoever . yet every time they gather together with a sort of hopeful hopelessness . what they were originally -- the units of these collections , heaven knows . fate has battered out of them every trace of individuality .
drake , [male] , an english admiral who did not have a public square named after him . d. also introduced the spud into [location] . dreamer , [male] , castle builder . lived long ago , and intended doing something today , spent much time thinking about the best girl in the world . a great friend of procrastinator , went through life waiting for tomorrow .
inch by inch , creaking and swaying , the room glided downward . the door seemed to glide upward beyond the ceiling , giving place to a solid wall . he turned and beat on the side of the room . and it gave forth a hollow sound . as he moved , the room swayed under his feet .
the overture died down ; a bell tinkled , and the curtain parted in the middle . discovering cynthia sitting on a garden seat in the castle park . as the curtain fell at the end of the act . and the applause gave way to an excited buzz in the audience . patty hugged georgie gleefully , `` it 's fifty times better than last year ! ''
[male] himself , and looked gloomily across the room to where he stood . warming his legs at the blaze , [organization] found a difficulty in selecting words . a ticklish business , this , one that might well have disconcerted a diplomat , [organization] was no diplomat . and the fact enabled him to find a way in the present crisis . equipped by nature with an amiable tactlessness and a happy gift of blundering .
the huge steamer seems to act as a sort of magnet on the small fry of the harbour . for they rush out to her from the land in all their sorts and sizes . in a desperate race for supremacy , prominent among this fleet is a long . ungainly rowing boat propelled by a tough hibernian , and seated in the stern are his women folk . surrounded by baskets , who , in strong milesian vernacular , urge the rower on in his endeavours to reach the ship first .
`` i wo not do it again , and i am very sorry , '' pleaded [male] . but the clown would not be friends with him for ever so long . and was only appeased at last by being allowed to put [male] upside down in a tall wicker basket which stood in a corner . then he helped [male] to dress by buttoning all his clothes the wrong way . and hiding his stockings and necktie , while he was doing this .
he began to understand , a horrible suspicion of the state of affairs came into mr. [male] 's head . surely it had not come to that , he was a detective , -- he would find out . how was it to be done ? he began to submit sketches on approval to himself . it required an effort before he could walk into the angel bar . `` a lemonade and bitter , please , ''
you can ride almost any sort of horse with the west wessex as long as it is an animal that knows the country . the brogue knew the country intimately , having personally created most of the gaps that were to be met with in banks and hedges for many miles round . his manners and characteristics were not ideal in the hunting field . but he was probably rather safer to ride to hounds than he was as a hack on country roads . according to the mullet family , he was not really road shy .
satan to new comer , the trouble with you [location] people is . that you think you are the best people down here . whereas you are merely the most numerous , -- pudd'nhead [female] 's new calendar . we wandered contentedly around here and there in [location] ; to lahore , among other places . where the lieutenant governor lent me an elephant .
some for the glories of the sole , and some mew for the proper bowl of milk to come . ah , take the fish and let your credit go . and plead the rumble of an empty tum , one thing is certain , tho this stolen bite should be my last and wrath consume me quite . one taste of it within the area caught better than at the table lost outright .
planchet put away his money , and made up his accounts . amidst civilities addressed to his former master , planchet had with his equals the short speech and haughty familiarity of the rich shopkeeper who serves everybody and waits for nobody . d'artagnan observed this habit with a pleasure which we shall analyze presently . he saw night come on by degrees . and at length planchet conducted him to a chamber on the first story .
just beyond -- separated by the almost invisible wire fencing -- a group of peasants were working in the field . an old woman and a young girl , with ropes about their shoulders . were drawing a harrow , guided by a withered old scarecrow of a man . they paused for a moment at the wire fencing . and looked through , it was an odd contrast ; the two worlds divided by that wire fencing .
after this pleasant experience it was with a light heart i accepted a similar invitation when shortly afterwards i visited another city . again i was to be entertained at a ladies club , but to my surprise i found it . not as i did the [location] club . modestly accommodated in a large flat , but a club having its own imposing building . as important as any in the west end of [location] , carriages lined the street .
in any case he is going to refuse to take anything more than a modest price for his pictures . beyond that , he says , not one pfennig , so this morning uncle rolled up his three canvasses under his arm and has gone away to sell them . so we talked for quite a little time , and i told him about uncle trying to get work and how hard it was and how at last he had got work . or at least had gone out to get it , as a painter , mr. [male] said that that was fine . he said that painters do well here : he has a lot of friends who are painters and they get all the way from sixty to seventy five cents an hour .
as the years went by they failed to please , [female] was a great improvement upon madeline . but she would not do , the truth was , if one may state it openly . [female] was not tough enough , in fact she was not tough at all . she turned out to be in reality just as proper and just as virtuous as madeline . so , too , with the air and grass hero , for all of his tempered muscles and his lariat and his winchester rifle .
all was stir and activity , meanwhile , those who look after [location] 's public amusements were busy with telephone and telegraph . the quarrel had taken place on friday night . it was probable that , unless steps were taken , the battle would begin early on saturday . which , it did not require a man of unusual intelligence to see . would mean a heavy financial loss to those who supplied [location] with its saturday afternoon amusements .
a delicate question : whether [female] really had any intention of going . and one which the historian of [female] would be highly embarrassed to answer , in plain words . [female] 's menagerie had left [location] over three months . and still the lion slayer had not started , after all , blinded by a new mirage . our candid hero may have imagined in perfectly good faith that he had gone to [location] .
`` not in this case , '' sez i . and then , at my request , she told me what they had paid out for doctors and medicines . and it come to five dollar and 63 cents more than josiah and i had paid for our board . and gate fees , and everything . and that did not count in the cost of their two dyspeptic boards , or their agony in sickness and sufferin ' .
their faces were in plain sight , as i looked at that of the woman i felt my heart cease beating and the colour leave my face . i looked into edith 's face . it was as pale as mine , what does it mean ? ', she whispered . edith put out her arms with a low cry and clasped me about the neck . harold , she murmured , my harold , have i done wrong ? ', i whispered .
perhaps it was a pity [male] had talked so profusely . he had driven miss abbott half demented . but he had given himself no time to concert a plan . the end came so suddenly , they emerged from the trees on to the terrace before the walk . with the vision of half tuscany radiant in the sun behind them .
the army under bragg was routed , and bragg resigned his command . burnside , who had been relieved of the command of the army of the potomac . was sent to east tennessee , where the brave but frost bitten troops of longstreet shut him up at knoxville and compelled him to board at the railroad eating house there . sherman 's worn and weary boys were now ordered at once to the relief of burnside . and longstreet , getting word of it .
that night he took his waterbury . prised open the face with a pocket knife as if he were opening an [male] . put the minute hand on exactly half an hour . and retired to bed satisfied , there was going to be no nonsense about it this time . i am sorry to disappoint the reader , but facts are facts .
his slippered feet stretched out luxuriously to the fire , dr. [male] . of mudford , lay back in his arm chair and gave himself up to the delights of his flor di cabajo , no . 2 , a box of which had been presented to him by an apparently grateful patient . it had been a busy day , he had prescribed more than half a dozen hot milk puddings and a dozen changes of air . he had promised a score of times to look in again tomorrow .
he was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees . and with a sort of a bib that went half way up his breast . upon the top of this , but a little below the hem , hung his croix . his basket of little pates was covered over with a white damask napkin . another of the same kind was spread at the bottom ; and there was a look of proprete and neatness throughout .
the comic man always rows with his wife if he is married or with his sweetheart if he is not married . they quarrel all day long , it must be a trying life . you would think , but they appear to like it . how the comic man lives and supports his wife ( she looks as if it wanted something to support her . too ) and family is always a mystery to us .
199 , two brothers coming to be executed once for some enormous crime ; the eldest was first turn would off . without saying one word : the other mounting the ladder , began to harangue the crowd . whose ears were attentively open to hear him , expecting some confession from him . good people , says he , my brother hangs before my face . and you see what a lamentable spectacle he makes .
the wisdom of our ancestors ( which i admire more and more every day ) . seemed to have determined that education of youth was so paltry and unimportant a matter . that almost any man , armed with a birch and regulation cassock and degree . might undertake the charge : and many an honest country gentleman may be found to the present day . who takes very good care to have a character with his butler when he engages him and will not purchase a horse without the warranty and the closest inspection .
there are woolly little puffs of smoke rising in places to show that the artillery is at its dreamy work on a hill side . near the foreground is a small group of generals standing about a tree and gazing through glasses at the dim purple of the background . there are sheep and cattle grazing in all the unused parts of the battle . the whole thing has a touch of quiet , rural feeling that goes right to the heart . i have seen people from the ranching district of [location] stand before these pictures in tears .
he exhibited a small piece of paper . the head examined it gravely , and admitted that the subject of the picture did not appear to be ostentatiously sober . the sunlight beat full on his face , which wore the intensely solemn expression of the man who . knowing his own condition , hopes , by means of exemplary conduct . to conceal it from the world , the head handed the photograph back without further comment .
seeing how the sentiment ran , i resolved to start a petition for [female] 's pardon . i got the signatures of the court . the court officers , the jury and the leading men of business in the country . just as i was about to take it to gov , thayer , there was an incident at the penitentiary . [male] had won the hearts of the warden and the guards to that extent that he was sent out one afternoon to assist one of the guards in overseeing the labor of a squad working in a stone quarry near by .
mrs. [female] died within the week . roxy remained in charge of the children . she had her own way . for mr. [male] soon absorbed himself in his speculations and left her to her own devices . in that same month of february , dawson 's landing gained a new citizen .
the grand seignior , to whom i was introduced by the imperial , russian , and french ambassadors . employed me to negotiate a matter of great importance at grand [location] . and which was of such a nature that it must ever remain a secret , during the late siege of gibraltar i went with a provision fleet . under lord rodney 's command . to see my old friend general elliot , who has , by his distinguished defence of that place .
the challenger faded quickly in the third round , and in the fourth the end came . we all suffered when he went down the first time . but he was up again , and the second time was much worse , it was in this knockdown that his head sagged suddenly . after he struck the floor , and fell back upon the canvas . he was conscious and his legs moved a little , but they would not obey him .
[female] could by no means divine what had incensed mr allworthy , for of master blifil he had not the least suspicion . however , as his friendship was to be tired out by no disappointments , he now determined to try another method of preserving the poor gamekeeper from ruin . by such kind of talents he had so ingratiated himself with the squire . that he was a most welcome guest at his table . and a favourite companion in his sport : everything which the squire held most dear .
the news which he had heard did afflict lord [male] very much . a day or two after the dinner party in [male] square he found mr. [male] . his brother 's agent , and learned from him that miss [female] 's story was substantially true . the marquis had informed his man of business that an heir had been born to him . but had not communicated the fact to any one of the family , this omission .
do not be alarmed -- it 's not serious , it is arranged that , until it is decided which of [location] two is the actual king . we are to act as one person , giorgio . exactly , giu . now , although we act as one person , we are . in point of fact , two persons , annibale . ah , i do not think we can go into that , it is a legal fiction .
i thanked my mother effusively , i think i cried a little , she said affectionately that the hour had been one of great interest to her . and she added that she would be glad to be consulted with regard to the steps i contemplated taking in my literary future . i went to my room and re read the last letter i had had from [female] . my darling margie , -- i am writing this line simply and solely for the selfish pleasure i gain from the act of writing to you . i know everything will come right some time or other , but at present i am suffering from a bad attack of the blues .
when the good man had ended his speech , [male] was the last who deserted the room . thence he retired to his own apartment . to give vent to his concern ; but the restlessness of his mind would not suffer him to remain long there . he slipped softly therefore to allworthy 's chamber door , where he listened a considerable time without hearing any kind of motion within . unless a violent snoring , which at last his fears misrepresented as groans .
my old friend peggotty tells me . in a quiet , matter of fact manner , a story much more weird than this , he says that after we watchers had left the scene . the divers got fairly to work and attained a fair run of the ship . they found she lay broadside on to a bank of sand . by the edge of which she had sunk till it overtopped her decks .
i slam the record player shut . grab a stick and ball , and run down the three flights of stairs to the street . this is not the first time pop and i have played this scene . and there gets to be a pattern : when i slam out of our house mad . i go along over to my aunt kate 's .
and so , presently we took to the hand car and went flying down the mountain again . flying and stopping , flying and stopping , till at last we were in the plain once more and stowed for calcutta in the regular train . that was the most enjoyable day i have spent in the earth . for rousing , tingling , rapturous pleasure there is no holiday trip that approaches the bird flight down the himalayas in a hand car . it has no fault , no blemish .
but i shall wait till you have received your appointment . will you wait ? yes but -- yes but -- are you not going to compete with me , eh , no . it is only the moral victory i care for . why , bless me -- then aunt [female] was right after all ! oh yes -- i knew it , hedda , just fancy -- eilert lovborg is not going to stand in our way !
we resented at once the law of gravity . the malthusian theory and the fact that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points . everything scientific , exact , and inevitable was distasteful , we wanted the man with the curves to win . it seemed impossible throughout the first round , carpentier was first out of his corner and landed the first blow . a light but stinging left to the face , then dempsey closed in and even the people who paid only thirty dollar for their seats could hear the thump .
[female] dieu , cried the count . rising out of his chair , mais vous plaisantez , said he . correcting his exclamation. -- i laid my hand upon my breast . and with earnest gravity assured him it was my most settled opinion . the count said he was mortified he could not stay to hear my reasons .
he tugged away furiously , with an eye on the now rapidly advancing and loudly shouting figure of the housemaster . and from the darkened house beyond there came a gradually swelling hum , as if a vast hive of bees had been disturbed . psmith leaned against the mantelpiece in the senior day room at outwood 's . since [male] 's innings against downing 's the lost lambs had been received as brothers by the center of disorder . so that even spiller was compelled to look on the hatchet as buried -- and gave his views on the events of the preceding night .
he was also , on his part , able , with a little trouble . to understand what the collector said , which was that he must pay eighteen marks . and he had to , as for the other three , two at all events of whom were excellent german scholars . they did not understand anything , and nobody could make them understand anything . the collector roared at them for about ten minutes .
toward morning gawaine seemed resigned to his career . at daybreak the headmaster saw him to the edge of the forest and pointed him to the direction in which he should proceed . about a mile away to the southwest a cloud of steam hovered over an open meadow in the woods and the headmaster assured gawaine that under the steam he would find a dragon . gawaine went forward slowly , he wondered whether it would be best to approach the dragon on the run as he did in his practice in the south meadow or to walk slowly toward him . shouting `` rumplesnitz '' all the way , the problem was decided for him .
you will ask me why it was that during all this time i had said nothing of that which was nearest my heart . the need for guarding the emperor , as a fact . i had tried to speak of it both to soult and to lobau . but their minds were so overwhelmed with the disaster and so distracted by the pressing needs of the moment that it was impossible to make them understand how urgent was my message . besides , during this long flight we had always had numbers of french fugitives beside [location] on the road .
at heart he ached for romance . but romance passed him by , the ladies of the court ignored his existence . while , as for those wandering damsels who came periodically to camelot to complain of the behaviour of dragons . giants , and the like , and to ask permission of the king to take a knight back with them to fight their cause ( just as . nowadays , one goes out and calls a policeman ) , he simply had no chance .
he would neither join a temperance society . nor omit his glass of wine when he felt inclined to take it . it is only fair to say , however , that such spirituous indulgences were not of frequent occurrence . it was more the principle of the thing . as he said , that he stood upon , than any thing else .
he snatched the bag from the rack and hurled it out of the window . ( porter robinson , who happened to be in the line of fire . escaped with a flesh wound , ) then he sat down again with the inward glow of satisfaction which comes to one when one has risen successfully to a sudden emergency . the glow lasted till the next stoppage , which did not occur for a good many miles . then it ceased abruptly , for the train had scarcely come to a standstill when the opening above the door was darkened by a head and shoulders .
mithoo and all the crowd have been dust and ashes and forgotten . oh , so many , many , many lagging years , and then comes a sense of injury . you do not know whether mithoo got the swag . along with the sin , or had to divide up the swag and keep all the sin himself . there is no literary art about a government report .
i was interrupted during my reflections by the bursting of rain upon the house roofs . and the stream which rose from the streets as the large drops came faster and faster down . i went to the door to look for my old friend , but not a dog was to be seen . i was surprised at the sight of the sky where i had observed the clouds rising a little while before . for now those same clouds looked like big rocks piled one above another , with patches of light shining through great caverns .
he was a mere kinglet and of little or no consequence at the time of [male] 's arrival in 1788 . but about four years afterward he conceived the idea of enlarging his sphere of influence . that is a courteous modern phrase which means robbing your neighbor -- for your neighbor 's benefit . and the great theater of its benevolences is [location] . kamehameha went to war , and in the course of ten years he whipped out all the other kings and made himself master of every one of the nine or ten islands that form the group .
but the pale face can not tickle [location] with a barley straw on the fourth of july and make [location] laugh . you can kill the red man , but you can not make him hilarious over his own funeral . these are the words of truth , and my warriors will do well to paste them in their plug hats for future reference . while in new england trying in my poor , weak way to represent the `` rowdy west , '' i met a sad young man who asked me if i lived in chi eene .
carlton met miss [female] that afternoon in a state of great excitement . it 's come , he cried -- it 's come ! i am to meet her this week , i have met her brother . and he has asked me to dine with them on thursday night . that 's the day before they leave for athens .
now there rattled out a challenge of drums ; loud music struck upon the air . starting instantly to go to [male] , noble 's left leg first received the electric impulse and crossed his laggard right . but he was no pacer , and thus stumbled upon himself and plunged . still convulsive , he came headlong before her , and was the only person near who remained unaware that his dispersal of an intervening group had the appearance of extreme unconventionality . noble knew nothing except that this was his dance with her .
`` yes , '' said [female] eagerly , `` do you know anyone ? '' [female] 's head throbbed , this thing was too much . the human brain could not be expected to cope with it , here was a youth who had borrowed a pound from one friend the day before . and three pounds from another friend that very afternoon . already looking about him for further loans , was it a hobby .
there might , when mr. [male] stood up , have been some doubt whether his voice could be heard throughout the vast throng gathered in front of the tree . but the first tones of the speaker 's voice dispelled uncertainty . and the congregation settled quietly down , whilst mr. [male] . with uplifted hands , besought the spirit of god to be with them . even as in their accustomed places of worship , a hymn was sung .
the toil of the day over , they wandered out towards the seashore . taking the path which led through the olive road by the garden of the villa . at times the youth would steal away a moment from his companion . and enter the little park , with every avenue of which he was familiar . and although billy noticed his absence , he strictly abstained from the slightest allusion to it .
i really prefer my coffee with three lumps in it . but i noticed that his printed form was now completely filled in , and i hated to call for a third lump and put him to the trouble of starting his literary labors all over again . besides , by that time the coffee would be cold . so i took it as it was -- with two lumps only . and it was pretty fair coffee for european coffee .
thus rallying , they begin to get the bibbing bottle , and guess at the same time . as if it had been told them , that the doctor in his last receipt had ordered rhenish wine . and just as the women in the eighth pleasure of the first part produce abundance of remedies . the assembly of men do here in like manner cast up a hundred receits which makes peggy the maid blush and be most cruelly ashamed at . but behind the window she listens most sharply to hear what 's told and confessed by those that be in the chamber .
if agony had not caused mr [male] to clutch for support at the back of a chair . he would undoubtedly have wrung his hands , `` rotten , '' said freddie . and returned to his [organization] , otis [male] tottered into his cab . he was shattered by what he had heard , they had massacred his beautiful play . and , doing so , had not even made a success of it by their own sordid commercial lights .
[female] was physically a sleepy young woman . and might easily have been supposed to be morally a lazy one , it is . however , certain that the work of her house was done somehow , and it is even more rapidly ascertainable that nobody else did it . the logician is , therefore , driven back upon the assumption that she did it . and that lends a sort of mysterious interest to her personality at the beginning .
i think the trust will be handed down like the other papacy . and will always know how to handle its limitless cash , it will press the button . the zeal , the energy , the sincerity . the enthusiasm of its countless vassals will do the rest . the power which a man 's imagination has over his body to heal it or make it sick is a force which none of [location] is born without .
so when they got the news that the king had lost confidence in [male] . the sitting member , they never questioned it a bit , lost confidence ? all right , they would elect him another right away . they would elect him half a dozen if he needed them . they do not mind ; they would elect the whole town man after man rather than have the king worried about it .
there is no case anywhere of aristocracy having established a universal and applicable order . as despots and democracies have often done ; as the last caesars created the roman law . as the last jacobins created the code napoleon . with the first of these elementary forms of government , that of the king or chieftain . we are not in this matter of the sexes immediately concerned .
`` the two last waltzes , '' i murmured , when parting with her , she nodded . i roamed the gunton cresswells 's rooms awaiting them . the thing was utterly beyond me at the time . looking back , i am still amazed to what lengths deliberate coquetry can go , she actually took pains to elude me . and gave those waltzes to strangers , from being comfortably rocked in the dark blue waters of a grecian sea .
`` good morning , sir , '' said violet . from my list of contributory causes i find that i have omitted one item . viz. , that there did not appear to be anybody else about , [male] looked meditatively at violet . violet looked smilingly at [male] , the morning was just as ripping as it had been a moment before . [male] was still twenty two , and the editor 's letter had not ceased to crackle in his breast pocket .
breaking out at night , however , was a different thing altogether , it was on another plane . there are times when a master must waive sentiment . and remember that he is in a position of trust . and owes a duty directly to his headmaster , and indirectly , through the headmaster . to the parents , he receives a salary for doing this duty .
`` thank you , '' answered [female] . `` you are very kind , '' and he began to smoke in the cab . the duellists had from their own point of view escaped or conquered the chief powers of the modern world . they had satisfied the magistrate , they had tied the tradesman neck and heels . and they had left the police behind , as far as their own feelings went they had melted into a monstrous sea .
[male] realised that a new life had opened for him . he was no longer a despised outcast , he had entered the [location] criminal class . at the police station the chief showed [male] to his room . he said good night and shut the door . in a moment he reappeared , next morning .
it was nearly the end of october when miss mackenzie left the cedars and at that time of the year there is not much difficulty in getting lodgings in [location] . the house which her brother walter occupied in arundel street had . at his death , remained in the hands of an old servant of his . who had bought her late master 's furniture with her savings . and had continued to live there , letting out the house in lodgings , her former mistress had gone to see her once or twice during the past year .
but now the word `` future '' had been written in front of that word . there were other additions , in red ink -- many cities . with great populations set down , scattered over the vast country at points where neither cities nor populations exist today . one of these cities , with population placed at 1,500,000 , bore the name `` libertyorloffskoizalinski , '' and there was a still more populous one , centrally located and marked `` capital , ''
there needed no more than these words to complete her revival ; and doña estafania having no further need of stratagem . requested the priest to marry her son to [location] on the spot . this was done ; for the event took place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of a marriage . without any of the preliminary formalities which are now so properly required , i leave it to a more ingenious pen than mine to describe the gladness of all present . the embraces bestowed on [location] by [location] 's parents .
the rest of the party were now returning , and all were soon collected , with some there was great joy at the sight of [female] churchill . others took it very composedly ; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on miss [female] 's disappearance being explained . that it was time for every body to go . concluded the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for the next day 's scheme , they parted . [male] little inclination to exclude himself increased so much .
many contending passions were raised in our heroe 's mind by this letter . but the tender prevailed at last over the indignant and irascible , and a flood of tears came seasonably to his assistance . and possibly prevented his misfortunes from either turning his head , or bursting his heart . and now having taken a resolution to leave the country , he began to debate with himself whither he should go . the world , as [male] phrases it .
after half an hour i read through my list . and could not help smiling , i had indeed a mixed lot of acquaintances . first came [male] and malim , the two pillars of my world . i scratched them out , [male] had been asked and had refused . and , as for malim , i shrank from exposing my absurd compositions to his critical eye .
he sprang from the train , i saw him through the window . moving toward the waiting room , he did not seem going very fast , the porters were calling . `` all abawd , all abawd , '' there was the clang of a bell . a hiss of steam , and in a second the train was off . i waited , looking out of the window and wondering who the man was , anyway .
the lady interviewer , miss [female] blivens . had gone trembling into the presence of [female] , to be instantly put at her ease by the young artist 's simple , unaffected manner . he chatted of his early struggles when he was only too glad to accept the few paltry hundreds of dollar a week that were offered him in minor parts . of his quick rise to eminence ; of his unceasing effort to give the public something better and finer . of his love for the great out of doors ; and of his daily flight to the little nest that sheltered his pal wife and the kiddies .
accordingly , he did so , and he flew through the small town like a red dragon pursuing his prey . unheeding all obstacles in his mad career , his automobile ran into a wall of rock . and was dashed to pieces , also , the young man was killed , a soldier of the russians lay japanned at tschrtzvkjskivitch . there was lack of woman 's nursing and other comforts which might add to his last moments and smooth the final way . but a comrade stood beside him to hear what he might say .
she deposed , that upon her going to mr. [male] 's house to demand payment of some money he owed her . he took her round the waist with one arm . whilst he gave her a violent blow on her shoulder with the other . and then turned her out of door , the magistrate expressed some doubt whether so small a man as mr. [male] could encircle her waist with one arm . but she assured him it was the fact .
secrets of the green pathways that lead up through the blue silent fields of space - shall we float from star to star ? secrets of holiness ! shall earthly faces wear the pure light of the immortals , but oh ! who shall be the happy soul that shall be listening when the time has fully come and he shall reveal his great secret ? the happy soul listening so intently that it shall catch the low , clear whisper .
you have travelled , i know you have ; in the empire state express . and the new limited and the maritime express that holds the record of six hundred whirling miles from [location] to marseilles . but what are they to this , this mad career , this breakneck speed . this thundering roar of the mariposa local driving hard to its home ! do not tell me that the speed is only twenty five miles an hour .
a boy of adair 's type is always a force in a school . in a big public school or six or seven hundred , his influence is felt less . but in a small school like sedleigh he is like a tidal wave . sweeping all before him , there were two hundred boys at sedleigh , and there was not one of them in all probability who had not . directly or indirectly , been influenced by adair , as a small boy his sphere was not large .
no man ever developed his mind by neglecting his body . and if the memory of a coarse and ruthless school tradition can persuade the super intellectual to play hockey or go down to the river after lunch . instead of sitting indoors drinking liqueurs and discussing maupassant with a coterie of the elect . then the can-can in the lower dormitory has not been danced altogether in vain , then come the rank and file . there are many types , there is the precocious type , marked out for favourable notice by aptitude at games and attractive manners .
he talks very little , perhaps it is because he is not bright . and is sensitive about it and wishes to conceal it , it is such a pity that he should feel so . for brightness is nothing ; it is in the heart that the values lie . i wish i could make him understand that a loving good heart is riches . and riches enough , and that without it intellect is poverty .
we never had the strength of character to get any good out of it . it 's a fallacy , of course . to think of a chronic drunkard or a chronic anything as a person of weak will . indeed , as a matter of fact , his will is so strong that he has been able to marshal all his energies into one channel and to make himself thereby a specialist . in all our life we have never met but two determined men .
i am enclosing a visitor 's card to the city club here . which i wish you would use during your stay , i am sure that you will find there several bon vivants who will be glad to join you in a game of vingt et [organization] . and in the large room on the second floor is a victrola with splendid instrumental and vocal records of `` la marseillaise . '' au revoir until i see you this afternoon , [female] . and above all , in writing to strangers or comparative strangers , seek to avoid the mention of subjects which might be distasteful to the recipient of the letter .
`` i will make them understand , '' said [male] . he drew her hand into his arm . and they wandered about in the garden , talking , for an hour . [male] allowed [male] time to plead his cause . and then , on the third day , he sought an interview with his uncle .
the sound of this bell caused a door to be opened in the offices on the left hand of the court . from which filed two maitres d'hotel followed by eight scullions bearing a kind of hand barrow loaded with dishes under silver covers . one of the maitres d'hotel , the first in rank . touched one of the guards , who was snoring on his bench , slightly with his wand . he even carried his kindness so far as to place the halbert which stood against the wall in the hands of the man stupid with sleep .
in half an hour [male] came out again ; his collar was gone . and in his mouth he trailed a long piece of chewed ribbon . which he dropped with the queerest mixture of penitence and reproach at daisy 's feet . after that , of course , it was impossible to do anything but take him into favour at once . and he was generous enough to let daisy see that he bore her no malice for the trick she had played him .
miss charity , who knew he had a secret pleasure in the contemplation of the proposed change . suppressed her own , and went on to negotiate the terms , his views upon this subject were at first so very limited that another difference . involving possibly another shaking , threatened to ensue ; but by degrees they came to something like an understanding . and the storm blew over , indeed , miss charity 's idea was so agreeable to both . that it would have been strange if they had not come to an amicable agreement .
the stoutness of mr pickering . the orderliness of mr pickering . the dullness of mr pickering . all these things he perceived , and illumination broke upon him . for [male] pickering , in the first moment of their meeting .
of course , my action will be against him . against the bishop , i shall be bound to expose his conduct , what else can i do ? there are things which a man can not bear and live , were i to put up with this i must leave the school . leave the parish ; -- nay , leave the country . there is a stain upon me which i must wash out , or i can not remain here .
the idea that surroundings will mold a man is always mixed up with the totally different idea that they will mold him in one particular way . to take the broadest case , landscape no doubt affects the soul . but how it affects it is quite another matter . to be born among pine trees might mean loving pine trees , it might mean loathing pine trees . it might quite seriously mean never having seen a pine tree , or it might mean any mixture of these or any degree of any of them .
it struck a kind of panic into them . and , although no one answered him , many began to violently accuse one another . saying , `` you said he did not throw , '' and getting for reply . `` it is a lie , and i will make you eat it ! '' and so in a moment they were in a raging and noisy turmoil .
`` but i did not , you will find it on a chair in the [male] in a brown paper parcel . '' the information that his low manoeuvres had been rendered null and void and that the thing was on the strength after all . must have been the nastiest of jars , but there was no play of expression on his finely chiselled to indicate it . there very seldom is on [male] 's f c , in moments of discomfort . as i had told tuppy , he wears a mask .
truth holds every decision , but the trouble is that he still keeps his cap down over his eyes . and he still mumbles his words , and nobody knows him until he is at least fifty years away and moving fast . at that distance he seems to grow bigger , and he invariably reaches into his back pocket and puts on his halo so that people can recognize him . still , when he comes along the next time and is face to face with any man of this world . the mortal is pretty sure to say , `` your face is familiar but i can not seem to place you . ''
some such system should be devised for censorship to make it practical . even with the weight of authority behind him no bland person . with virtue obviously unruffled , is altogether convincing when he announces that the book he has just read or the moving picture he has seen is so hideously immoral that it constitutes a danger to the community . for my part i always feel that if he can stand it so can i . to the best of my knowledge and belief , mr. [male] was not swayed from his usual course of life by so much as a single peccadillo for all of jurgen .
the remainder of the game does not call for detailed description . dacre 's pressed nearly the whole of the last half hour . but twice more the ball came out and went down merevale 's three quarter line . once it was the babe who scored with a run from his own goal line . and once charteris , who got in from half-way , dodging through the whole team .
mainly the round table talk was monologues . narrative accounts of the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their friends and backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor . as a general thing -- as far as i could make out -- these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries . nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out ; no , as a rule they were simply duels between strangers . duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other , and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever .
[female] eyed him inscrutably , he could look inscrutable at times , `` ah ! '' he said , and left quickly , with the feeling that , however poorly he had shown up during the actual interview . his exit had been good , he might have been a failure in the matter of disguise . but nobody could have put more quiet sinister ness into that `` ah ! '' it did much to soothe him and ensure a peaceful night 's rest .
this gentleman , whom mr [male] now visited , was what they call a man of the world . that is to say , a man who directs his conduct in this world as one who . being fully persuaded there is no other , is resolved to make the most of this . in his early years he had been bred to trade ; but , having acquired a very good fortune . he had lately declined his business ; or , to speak more properly , had changed it from dealing in goods .
mr [male] and his fair companion no sooner entered the town . than they went directly to that inn which in their eyes presented the fairest appearance to the street . here [male] , having ordered a servant to show a room above stairs . was ascending , when the dishevelled fair , hastily following , was laid hold on by the master of the house . who cried , heyday , where is that beggar wench going ?
poor little cinderella , perhaps it would have been better had god mamma been less ambitious for you , dear . had you married some good , honest yeoman , who would never have known that you were not brilliant . who would have loved you because you were just amiable and pretty ; had your kingdom been only a farmhouse . where your knowledge of domestic economy , gained so hardly , would have been useful . where you would have shone instead of being overshadowed ; where papa would have dropped in of an evening to smoke his pipe and escape from his domestic wrangles .
mr. [male] , looming over the table like a thundercloud . regarded archie with more than his customary hostility , life was no pleasant thing for the proprietor of the cosmopolis just now . once a man starts building hotels . the thing becomes like dram drinking , any hitch . any sudden cutting off of the daily dose , has the worst effects .
and he does , what the gardener says , i will leave you to imagine . judged from its structure , the rook family is supposed to come next in intelligence to man himself . judging from the intelligence displayed by members of certain human families with whom i have come in contact . i can quite believe it , that rooks talk i am positive . no one can spend half an hour watching a rookery without being convinced of this , whether the talk be always wise and witty .
dr. [female] is a liberal man and a pleasant . entertaining , and edifying companion , he deserves all the success he has ever received . `` long may he wave , '' the boys produced the manifestations by grasping the neck of the instrument . swinging it around , and thrusting it into different parts of the open space of the room . at the same time vibrating the strings with the fore finger .
the game which was to decide the fate of [female] and [female] belonged to the latter variety . a pitch had been mown in the middle of a meadow ( kindly lent by farmer rollitt on condition that he should be allowed to umpire . and his eldest son ted put on to bowl first ) , the team consisted of certain horny handed sons of toil . with terrific golf shots in the direction of square leg . and the enemy 's ranks were composed of the same material .
now , the reader says , `` here comes that same old plea of insanity again . '' but the reader has deceived himself this time . no such plea was offered in her defense , the judge sentenced her . nobody persecuted the governor with petitions for her pardon . and she was promptly hanged , insanity certainly is on the increase in the world .
then how am i to brighten others lives ? i asked . more than a little disappointed , for several humans hurrying past had turned upon me looks indicating moods receptive of all the brightening i could give . i might have amused myself indefinitely , studying the rapid succession of varying faces . had not bloomer cautioned me not to stare , she said people would think me from the country . which is considered discreditable , and as this reminded me that i had as yet seen nothing growing .
through that peaceful spring afternoon the life wave ebbed lower and lower . it was about half past six , and the sun lay just on the horizon . when dr. person noticed that the breathing . which had gradually become more subdued , broke a little , there was no suggestion of any struggle . the noble head turned a little to one side , there was a fluttering sigh .
of course you are in no position yet to think of being engaged even . and that 's why i am a little afraid that you may be planning to get married . but a twelve dollar clerk , who owes fifty two dollar for roses . needs a keeper more than a wife , i want to say right here that there always comes a time to the fellow who blows fifty two dollar at a lick on roses when he thinks how many staple groceries he could have bought with the money . after all , there 's no fool like a young fool , because in the nature of things he 's got a long time to live .
he sat down at his table and pressed the bell . harold , [male] 's brother and co messenger . entered with the air of one ready to duck if any missile should be thrown at him . the reports of the manager 's frame of mind had been circulated in the office . and harold felt somewhat apprehensive , it was on an occasion very similar to this that [male] barstead .
yesterday i saw him off to his new home . and when we meet again it will be on a different footing . `` is that your dog ? '' i shall say to his master . what is he ? a cocker ? jolly little fellows . are not they ? i had one myself once .
i tried to buy a diploma for an invalid friend at home who had never traveled . and whose desire all his life has been to ascend mont blanc . but the guide in chief rather insolently refused to sell me one , i was very much offended . i said i did not propose to be discriminated against on the account of my nationality . that he had just sold a diploma to this german gentleman .
we went down on to the sands this morning . we had not been walking up and down for more than half an hour before we came across the distinct imprint of a human foot . someone must have been there this very day , we were a good deal alarmed . we could not imagine how he came there , the weather is too fine for shipwrecks . and it was not a part of the coast where any passing trader would be likely to land .
those who disliked the book did not speak of mr. [male] passos as either a realist or a romanticist . they simply called him a traitor and let it go at that . the enthusiasts on the other side neglected to say anything about his style because they needed the space to suggest that he ought to be the next candidate for president from [organization] . speaking as a native born [location] who once voted for a socialist for membership in the board of aldermen . the writer must admit that he has found the radical solidarity of critical approval or dissent more trying than that of the conservatives .
when a bachelor sniffs through his letters before opening them in the morning . it is not a sign that he is looking for dynamite . but that he is looking for a note bearing a brand of sachet which he has mistaken for some girl 's `` sweet personality . '' a man falls in love through his eyes . a woman through her imagination , and then they both speak of it as an affair of `` the heart . ''
he had not seen him for some years . but , going by his recollections of him at the university . he had expected something cheerier than this , in fact . he had rather been relying on eustace to be the life and soul of the party . the man sitting on the bag before him could hardly have filled that role at a gathering of russian novelists .
i got it out of the nineteenth century where they know how . they had such headway that they were nearly to the king before they could check up . then , frantic with rage , they stood up their horses on their hind hoofs and whirled them around . and the next moment here they came , breast to breast . i was seventy yards off , then , and scrambling up a great bowlder at the roadside .
so there it was , a straight contest between me and [female] and mrs [female] and her man . every nerve in my system was tingling with suspense and excitement . was it not ? it was not , [male] , as i have already hinted . was not a dancer who took much of his attention off his feet while in action . he was there to do his durnedest , not to inspect objects of interest by the wayside .
they were still in the saloon ; he heard them trampling about . moving the furniture with unnecessary violence , and addressing one another in tones that were not caressing . now they were carrying the statue to the window . he heard their labouring breath and groans of exertion under the burden , another pause . he stole lower down the staircase , until he was outside his sitting room .
he separated two heated youths who were just beginning a fourth round . the rest of the warriors , seeing silver and the others . called a truce , and silver , having read a sort of riot act , moved on . the juniors of the beaten house . deciding that it would be better not to resume hostilities , consoled themselves by giving three groans for mr [male] .
schoolgirls we , eighteen and under , from scholastic trammels free . and we wonder -- how we wonder , -- what on earth the world can be , [female] . at last , my bride that is to be , you are not going to kiss me before all these people ? i am so glad , i have not seen you for ever so long , and i am right at the top of the school . and i have got three prizes , and i have come home for good .
the gentlemen and ladies were presented to their majesties and monsieur le cardinal . the study of the young king , which had begun a long time before . without anybody suspecting it , was continued then , and he looked around him attentively to endeavor to make out something in the physiognomies which had at first appeared the most insignificant and trivial . a collation was served , the king , without daring to call upon the hospitality of his uncle . had waited for it impatiently , this time , therefore , he had all the honors due .
she had on one occasion threatened to strike lecturing unless she were allowed a certain very large percentage on the sum taken at the doors . and the stewards and directors of the institute had found themselves compelled to give way to her demands . she had consequently lodged herself magnificently at the langham hotel . had set up her brougham , in which she always had herself driven to the institute . and was asked out to dinner three or four times a week ; whereas the baroness was in a very poor condition .
in short , so strangely entertaining were both manner and matter of his narratives . that `` munchausen 's stories '' became a by word among a host of appreciative acquaintance . among these was raspe , who years afterwards . when he was starving in [location] , bethought himself of the incomparable baron . he half remembered some of his sporting stories , and supplemented these by gleanings from his own commonplace book .
`` hush , '' answered harriet , and dandled the bundle laboriously , like some bony prophetess . judith , or [male] , or jael . he had last seen the baby sprawling on the knees of miss abbott . shining and naked , with twenty miles of view behind him . and his father kneeling by his feet .
when [male] 's will was read such was found to be the case , there was no doubt . or room for doubt , in the matter . the will was dated but two months before his death , and left everything to [male] . expressing a conviction on the part of the testator that it was his duty to do so . because of his sister 's unremitting attention to himself .
as a bailiff , when well authorized by his writ , having possessed himself of the person of some unhappy debtor . views all his tears without concern ; in vain the wretched captive attempts to raise compassion . in vain the tender wife bereft of her companion . the little prattling boy , or frighted girl . are mentioned as inducements to reluctance , the noble bumtrap , blind and deaf to every circumstance of distress .
the ball soared over the wicket keep 's head and went to the boundary . the bowler grinned pleasantly , and said he was just getting his arm in . the second ball landed full pitch on the batsman 's right thigh . the third was another full pitch , this time on the top of the middle stump . which it smashed , with profound satisfaction the batsman hobbled to the trees .
One Third Off by [female] at [organization] the way i look at this thing is this way . if something happens to you and by writing about it you can make a bit of money and at the same time be a benefactor to the race . then why not ? does not the philanthropic aspect of the proposition more than balance off the mercenary side ? i hold that it does , or at least that it should . in the estimation of all fair minded persons , it is to this class that i particularly address myself .
evidently he had felt unduly conspicuous so far in front , winning in a common canter was not cricket to his mind . he wanted to make a race of it while there was still time . and as the speed and the lead of [female] alcock abated . down the stretch from far in the rear dashed the black mare bellsolar . suddenly i remembered the ominous words of hindoo , `` may be heard from if up to her last race . ''
it had reached an almost caressing softness . when a knock at the door caused her to stop suddenly . a moment later , the iron was banged upon the rest . and she glanced down at her apron , to use her own phrase . she was the `` pink of neatness . ''
with the coming of january , it was mortimer 's practice to leave england and go to the south of [male] . where there was sunshine and crisp dry turf . he pursued his usual custom this year . with his suit case and his ninety four clubs he went off to saint brule . staying as he always did at the hotel superbe .
he paused to allow those wishing to do so to refresh themselves with another look at uncle [male] . and i found myself musing in some little perplexity . long association with the members of the drones has put me pretty well in touch with the various ways in which an overdose of the blushful hippocrene can take the individual . but i had never seen anyone react quite as gussie was doing . there was a snap about his work which i had never witnessed before .
sill , well mercury , my boy . you have had a year 's experience of [location] here . how do we do it ? i think we are rather an improvement on the original gods . do not you ? mer , well , you see . there 's a good deal to be said on both sides of the question .
he struck the bag of pistoles with his clenched hand as he spoke . and it fell heavily to the ground , he resumed that dismal laugh that had so alarmed parry . and whilst the whole household was screaming , singing , and preparing to install the travelers who had been preceded by their lackeys . he glided out by the principal entrance into the street . where the old man , who had gone to the window , lost sight of him in a moment .
he stopped , but only for an instant , the next he had darted across the room . and , before the horrified eyes of mr warden . was holding ruth in his arms , she clung to him . bill , the fox terrier , over whom mr vince had happened to stumble . was the first to speak , almost simultaneously mr warden joined in , and there was a striking similarity between the two voices .
george 's heart was thundering against his ribs . he could scarcely speak , he contrived to emit a no , i did not think at first i could get away . i had to , , , she broke off with a cry . the rat , fond of exercise like all rats . had made another of its excitable sprints across the floor , a hand clutched nervously at [male] 's arm .
raoul followed him , hat in hand . and a little disconcerted at the noise made by his spurs in these immense salons . as soon as he had disappeared in the interior of the palace . the window of the court was repeopled , and an animated whispering betrayed the emotion of the two girls . they soon appeared to have formed a resolution , for one of the two faces disappeared from the window .
others say that he fell into the sea off the coast of wales and became what is now known as king 's rocks . this last has never been authenticated , at any rate , the son , on ascending the throne , became king . his first official act was to order dinner . `` a nice , juicy steak , '' he is said to have called for . `` french fries , apple pie and a cup of coffee . ''
here was a second heavy surprise for marjorie : they were not looking at her . they were looking with beaming approval at a girl she had never seen . a dark and modish stranger of singularly composed and yet modest aspect . her downcast eyes , becoming in one thus entering a crowded room , were all that produced the effect of modesty . counteracting something about her which might have seemed too assured , she was very slender .
in this expectant hush , a man in a check tweed suit walks on the stage . only one man , one single man , because if he had been accompanied by a chorus . that would have been a burlesque ; if four citizens in togas had been with him . that would have been [male] ; if two russian soldiers had walked after him . that would have been melodrama , but this is none of these , this is a problem play .
dropsy , indeed , sure i have not lived to the age of fifty five . and had such experience of my own disorder , and consulted you and other eminent physicians . so often , and so long , to be undeceived by such a -- but , without all doubt . the man is mad ; and , therefore , what he says is of no consequence . i had , yesterday , a visit from higgins .
`` please do not , it 's absolutely all right , '' his eye wandered to the mantelpiece . as it had done once or twice during the conversation , in her hurry jill had replaced the snapshot with its back to the room . and wally had the fidgety air of a man whose most cherished possession is maltreated . he got up now and , walking across , turned the photograph round . he stood for a moment , looking at it .
and the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer . and everybody joined in with all their might , and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out . music is a good thing ; and after all that soul butter and hogwash i never see it freshen up things so . and sound so honest and bully , then the king begins to work his jaw again . and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening .
the hours of the morning between breakfast and lunch were the time which the inhabitants of riseholme chiefly devoted to spying on each other . they went about from shop to shop on household businesses . occasionally making purchases which they carried away with them in little paper parcels with convenient loops of string . but the real object of these excursions was to see what everybody else was doing . and learn what fresh interests had sprung up like mushrooms during the night .
the football fifteen had been hopeless , and had lost both the ripton matches . the return by over sixty points , sheen 's victory in the light weights at aldershot had been their one success . and now , on top of all this , the [male] of cricket was removed during the easter holidays . [male] 's heart bled for [male] . and he found himself loathing sedleigh and all its works with a great loathing .
through the curtained windows of the furnished flat which mrs. [female] had rented for her stay in [location] . rays of golden sunlight peeped in like the foremost spies of some advancing army . it was a fine summer morning . the hands of the dutch clock in the [female] pointed to thirteen minutes past nine . those of the ormolu clock in the sitting room to eleven minutes past ten .
he communicated to his uncle what the reader hath been just before acquainted with . he now enquired for the messenger ; but blifil told him it had been impossible to detain him a moment . for he appeared by the great hurry he was in to have some business of importance on his hands . that he complained of being hurried and driven and torn out of his life , and repeated many times . that if he could divide himself into four quarters .
none of these forms of getting away with money appeal to araminta and myself . as soon as it was ascertained that the automobile was practicable and would not cost a king 's ransom . i determined to devote my savings to the purchase of one . araminta and i lived in a suburban town . she because she loves nature and i because i love araminta .
but the chaplain 's morals were sterner than those of brotherton at large . and he was still of opinion that the dean was a child of wrath . and poor [male] , therefore , a grandchild , now , when he saw the dean and his son in law apparently on friendly terms . the spirit of righteousness was vexed within him as he acknowledged this to be another sign that the dean was escaping from that punishment which alone could be of service to him in this world . his lordship is better this morning , i hope .
i picked up such members of the family as fell in my vicinity . and subordinates of my corps collected the rest . none of these poor people were injured , happily , but they were much annoyed . i explained to the head chaleteer just how the thing happened . and that i was only searching for the road , and would certainly have given him timely notice if i had known he was up there .
there is a picture in the [location] gallery at [location] . the decadence of the romans , which made the fame and fortune of couture , the painter . it represents an orgie in the court of a temple . during the last days of rome , a swarm of revellers occupy the middle of the picture . wreathed in elaborate intricacy of luxurious posture , men and women intermingled .
but this new cloudy political cowardice has rendered useless the old english compromise . people have begun to be terrified of an improvement merely because it is complete . they call it utopian and revolutionary that anyone should really have his own way . or anything be really done , and done with , compromise used to mean that half a loaf was better than no bread . among modern statesmen it really seems to mean that half a loaf is better than a whole loaf .
it was not till she was out driving in a hired car with gerald one afternoon on [location] isle that enlightenment came . gerald , since the departure of miss [female] . had been at his best , like fillmore , he was a man who responded to the sunshine of prosperity . his moodiness had vanished , and all his old charm had returned , and yet ... it seemed to sally , as the car slid smoothly through the pleasant woods and fields by the river .
it might be true in her case -- it must be . or why had she let him go that afternoon ? but , for himself , the separation had taught him that he loved her as much as ever . more than ever , absence had purified him of that dull anger which had been his so short a while before . he looked back and marvelled that he could ever have imagined for a moment that he had ceased to love her .
she was now remaining there without divulging her circumstances , under the advice and by the authority of her cousin . and she had resolved to be guided by him in all things as long as he would be at the trouble to guide her . on whom else could she depend ? but , nevertheless , her position was very grievous to her . and the more so now that her aunt had twitted her with ingratitude , when the servant came to her . she felt that she had no right to the girl 's services .
babbitt tearfully said that good old fult was a prince . and yes , he certainly would cut it out , and thereafter he lighted a cigarette and took a drink and had a terrific quarrel with tanis when she caught him being affectionate with carrie nork . next morning he hated himself that he should have sunk into a position where a fifteenth rater like [location] bemis could rebuke him . he perceived that , since he was making love to every woman possible . tanis was no longer his one pure star .
examine your heart , my good reader , and resolve whether you do believe these matters with me . if you do , you may now proceed to their exemplification in the following pages . if you do not , you have , i assure you . already read more than you have understood ; and it would be wiser to pursue your business . or your pleasures , than to throw away any more of your time in reading what you can neither taste nor comprehend .
what mattered a fly or so in the dawn of these delights ? perhaps he had been dashed a minute by the shameful episode of the young lady in grey . and perhaps the memory of it was making itself a little lair in a corner of his brain from which it could distress him in the retrospect by suggesting that he looked like a fool . but for the present that trouble was altogether in abeyance , the man in drab . evidently a swell -- had spoken to him as his equal , and the knees of his brown suit and the chequered stockings were ever before his eyes .
it was when i was still quite a boy that my first great chance came . being in [location] , i was asked one day by my friend the late mr. [male] to make some illustrations for a paper called zozimus . of which he was the editor and founder . as a matter of fact , zozimus was the irish punch . mr. [male] , who was a nationalist .
jones now returned in order to dress himself . while his dinner was preparing , and was , according to his orders , attended by the barber . he had a great many other particularities in his character . which i shall not mention , as the reader will himself very easily perceive them . on his farther acquaintance with this extraordinary person .
ladies near her looked like children . and the men about her looked mean , they looked like failures . and they looked as if they felt so , too , she sat with her back to us . i never saw such a back in my life , i would have so liked to see the moon rise over it . the whole congregation waited , under one pretext or another , till she finished her dinner and went out .
he had made his fortune , bought his house . and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence . with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through , he had never been an unhappy man . his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage . but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly amiable woman could be .
i have never found any difficulty in getting these gentry to accept money . they are eternally in need , but i usually find the information they give in return to be either unimportant or inaccurate . there remains , then , the third method , which is to place a spy among them . the spy battalion is the forlorn hope of the detective service . in one year i lost three men on anarchist duty .
my one idea was to get out , and to get out quickly , the window of the tower room was some twenty five feet above the ground . i sprang out through the casement in one leap and landed on the grass below . i jumped over the shrubbery in one bound and cleared the moat in one jump . i went down the avenue in about six strides and ran five miles along the road through the fens in three minutes . this at least is an accurate transcription of my sensations , it may have taken longer .
this bar of the uncle being now removed ( though young nightingale knew not as yet in what manner ) . and all parties being quickly ready , the mother , mr [male] . mr nightingale , and his love , stept into a hackney coach . which conveyed them to doctors commons ; where miss nancy was . in vulgar language , soon made an honest woman , and the poor mother became .
the team listened , but were not comforted , [male] might be below their usual strength . but then [male] cricket , as a rule . reached such a high standard that this probably meant little , however weak [male] might be . for them -- there was a very firm impression among the members of the sedleigh first eleven that the other school was quite strong enough to knock the cover off them . experience counts enormously in school matches .
`` now , '' said i , when he returned the bill to me receipted . `` the carpet looks firstrate ; i never saw a handsomer one in my life . '' `` well , you are an odd chap , any how , '' said the carpet dealer . laughing , and shaking me by the hand . almost from that moment we were more than mere acquaintances .
mr , [male] , of course . in the days that immediately followed , was not the only impatient spirit . but it may be said that of all the young spirits interested in the event none rose more eagerly to the level of the occasion . [female] left her father 's house with [female] young . they were imperturbably happy and they went far away , [male] and his young wife sought their felicity in a narrower circle .
these documents were sent , after which there was a lull of about three months . then the swelling in mr. [male] 's head had gone down a little . but there was still a seal brown taste in his mouth , so he wrote the claimant that it would be necessary to jog the memory of the department about dollar 3 dollar worth . and to file collateral testimony setting forth that claimant was a native born [location] or that he had declared his intention to become a citizen of [location] . that he had not formed nor expressed an opinion for or against the accused , which the testimony would not eradicate .
-- yes , i remember , and you shall hear all about it before i describe an evening at the settlement . but it do not amount to much. -- i told you how cross and over bearing tuck was at the astoria tower . and of the mean way in which he restricted my observations . well , of all the people in the grove that day there was only one whom i could see without being criticized . and he sat all alone and facing me , just behind tuck 's back .
lady ball had in truth mistaken her niece 's character . she had found her to be unobtrusive , gentle , and unselfish ; and had conceived that she must therefore be weak and compliant . as to many things she was compliant , and as to some things she was weak . but there was in her composition a power of resistance and self sustenance on which lady ball had not counted . when conscious of absolute ill usage , she could fight well , and would not bow her neck to any mrs stumfold or to any lady ball .
and [location] , with the comfortable feeling that he had managed to combine duty and pleasure after all . wrote a note to [male] at [organization] . telling him to be ready to start with the team for geddington by the 8.54 next morning . [male] 's uncle [male] was a wanderer on the face of the earth . he had been an army surgeon in the days of his youth .
he declined to run the risk , quietly and by degrees he had sold out the stocks and shares in which his fortune was invested . and deposited the money in his [location] bank . six piles of large notes , dividing the total into six equal parts . six letters couched in a strain of reminiscent pathos and manly resignation . six envelopes , legibly addressed ; six postage stamps ; and that part of his preparations was complete .
i can tell you the people of mariposa are proud of the trains . even if they do not stop , the joy of being on the main line lifts the mariposa people above the level of their neighbours in such places as tecumseh and nichols corners into the cosmopolitan atmosphere of through traffic and the larger life . of course , they have their own train . too -- the mariposa local , made up right there in the station yard , and running south to the city a hundred miles away . that , of course , is a real train , with a box stove on end in the passenger car .
it was during that evening that there flitted across his mind the first suspicion he had ever had that his uncle [male] 's mental outlook was a little limited . and now , as he paced the promenade , watching the stir and bustle of the crowd . he definitely condemned his absent relative as a narrow-minded chump . if the brown boots which he had [male] so assiduously in his bedroom that morning with the inside of a banana skin . and which now gleamed for the first time on his feet , had a fault .
it is a time for casting up and readjusting , likewise it is a good time for going over . in the calm , reflective light of second judgment . the purchases he has made for personal use and gift making purposes . these things seemed highly attractive when he bought them . and when displayed against a background of home surroundings will .
just here i want to say that while it 's all right for the other fellow to be influenced by appearances . it 's all wrong for you to go on them . back up good looks by good character yourself . and make sure that the other fellow does the same , a suspicious man makes trouble for himself . but a cautious one saves it , because there ai not any rotten apples in the top layer .
and when , on monday evening , [female] , on receipt of no fewer than four blows in a single round . a record , shook him by the hand and said that if ever he happened to want a leetle darg that was a perfect bag of tricks and had got a pedigree . mind you , he , [male] . would be proud to supply that animal , sheen felt that the moment had come to approach drummond on the subject of the house boxing . it would be a little awkward at first , and conversation would probably run somewhat stiffly .
can you beat it ? his features stained with a greenish hue ! now look at that , he might have put on high grade prepared paint or clear white lead . he 's rich enough , -- but , no , just a quiet shingle stain is enough for him . i can not resist adding from the same source the list of the chief guests . anybody desiring a set of names for a burlesque show to run three hundred nights on the circuit may have them free of charge or without infringement of copyright .
the young men separated , to mingle with the company , [female] could not help noticing miss [female] more particularly than before . and perceived that she was coldly polite to all the young men who ventured to approach her . but warm and smiling as a june morning to an individual named glover who had been abroad and returned home rich in hairy honours . if in nothing else , the manners of this glover distinguished him as much as his appearance . `` to think that a woman could be attracted by a thing like that , '' he said to himself a little pettishly .
and at this he brought up a fistful of loose silver and gold from one of his trouser pockets . and spread it deliberately out on the table in front of him in shining rows . it would ensure him surreptitious luxuries and open friendships as long as it lasted . even tipping , the head boy of the school . who had gone into tails , brought back no more , and besides , the money would bring him handsomely out of certain pecuniary difficulties to which an unexpected act of parental authority had exposed him .
our former correspondence was forthwith renewed , with the most hearty expressions of mutual good-will . and as we had met so unexpectedly , we agreed to dine together that very day at the tavern . my friend quin , being luckily unengaged , obliged [location] with his company . and , truly , this the most happy day i have passed these twenty years . you and i , [male] , having been always together , never tasted friendship in this high gout .
i felt i must deal with this person alone , for i feared the worst . and , asking them to excuse me , i went to the hedge and faced the frenchman with the frightful calm of despair . he was a short , stout little man , with blue cheeks . sparkling black eyes , and a vivacious walnut coloured countenance ; he wore a short black alpaca coat . and a large white cravat with an immense oval malachite brooch in the centre of it .
she never ties herself up to a tree . or hooks the dog , she never comes home . soaked and disagreeable , to tell you that she caught six , but put them all back again . because they were merely two or three pounders , and not worth the trouble of carrying . the pretty girl of art plays croquet with one hand .
he lay there on aunt eunice 's bed on the ground floor . where they had brought him in , he was not dead . and he did not die , he is making cotton in [location] now . but he looked mighty near it then , `` the deep cut in his head '' was the worst i then had ever seen , and the blow confused everything .
`` great heavens , '' he said to himself , and shot a glance at his wife from the corners of his eyes . `` lord , i am in for it . '' he then read the article through to see if there was any loop hole , but found that the explosion had occurred . perhaps , before he was five squares away -- about a quarter of ten , in fact . and he had admitted to his wife that he had stayed there until late at night !
we had originally intended to go on to magna charta island . a sweetly pretty part of the river , where it winds through a soft . [location] , and to camp in one of the many picturesque inlets to be found round that tiny shore . but , somehow , we did not feel that we yearned for the picturesque nearly so much now as we had earlier in the day . a bit of water between a coal barge and a gas works would have quite satisfied [location] for that night .
the girl in brown was quite close now , and [female] was enabled to get a clearer glimpse of her . she more than fulfilled the promise she had given at a distance . had she been constructed to his own specifications , she would not have been more acceptable in [female] 's sight . and now she was going out of his life for ever , with an overwhelming sense of pathos . for there is no pathos more bitter than that of parting from someone we have never met .
but it was the recollection that on previous occasions of wakefulness hot whisky and water had done the trick . which had now brought him from his bed and downstairs . his objective was the decanter on the table of the smoking room . which was one of the rooms opening on the gallery that looked down on the [male] . hot water he could achieve in his bedroom by means of his stove .
think of those days when the sergeant at arms of [organization] could not turn back the clock in order to assist an appropriation at the close of the session . but when the light went out the session closed , [location] succeeded his father . [male] the presiding elder , and resembled him a good deal by defeating the welsh . scots , and danes , in those days agriculture . trade , and manufacturing were diversions during the summer months .
but [male] , in this matter , would not follow his mother 's advice . and declared that he would take no further steps , `` he was inclined , '' he said , `` to think that [female] was right , why should any woman burden herself with nine children ? '' then lady ball said a great deal more about the ball money . giving it as her decided opinion that [female] owed herself and her money to the balls .
gold was so plentiful that it made people liberal like that . ballarat was a swarming city of tents in the early days . everybody was happy , for a time , and apparently prosperous , then came trouble . the government swooped down with a mining tax . and in its worst form , too ; for it was not a tax upon what the miner had taken out .
on sundays , his favorite locality was the place [male] la bourse . [male] was a well formed , stately looking individual , with a most self satisfied countenance . which seemed to say : i am master here ; and all that my auditors have to do is . to listen and obey , arriving at his destined stopping place , his carriage halted . his servant handed him a case from which he took several large portraits of himself .
i did not in the least know who [male] was . but it struck me with a thrill of indescribable terror that [male] had seen [male] . in my own quiet and measured existence such a thing had never happened , [male] seated himself in a chair on the other side of the fire from me . lighted a pipe and continued , my senses were now fully alert , that z should have followed [male] out of x . i could readily understand , but that he should first have followed him in seemed to pass the bounds of comprehension .
it was pugsy maloney who , on the fourth morning . brought to the office the inner history of the truce . his version was brief and unadorned , as was the way with his narratives . such things as first causes and piquant details he avoided . as tending to prolong the telling excessively , thus keeping him from the perusal of his cowboy stories .
why the boys should drive away , little sweet maidens from the play . or love to banter and fight so well , that 's the thing i never could tell . but this i know , i love to play , through the meadow , among the hay . up the water and o'er the lea , that 's the way for billy and me . buttercups and daisies , oh , the pretty flowers .
with a really genuine interest in the records before him . mr. [male] fell to work then , the bible had been in the blaisdell family for generations . and it was full of valuable names and dates . he began at once to copy them , mr. [male] . on the other side of the table , was arranging into piles the papers before him .
for half a century but a single marriage was known to have taken place after the lapse of two years only of courtship . and that turned out badly , frantz niklausse , then , loved suzel van tricasse . but quietly , as a man would love when he has ten years before him in which to obtain the beloved object . once every week , at an hour agreed upon , frantz went to fetch suzel . and took a walk with her along the banks of the vaar .
this , again , will not hold water ; for in the purely terrestrial and even sensual departments of life . such as love and lust , the medieval princes show the same mad promises and performances . the same misshapen imagination and the same monstrous self sacrifice , here we have a contradiction . to explain which it is necessary to think of the whole nature of vows from the beginning . and if we consider seriously and correctly the nature of vows .
the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by [female] 's calling at mrs. [female] 's a few days afterwards . harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her . written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach . with a great deal of kindness ; and till mr. [male] himself appeared . she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return .
at this point the little jew 's oration was interrupted by the hostile impact of a fist upon the point of his bearded chin and he toppled backward to a sprawl on the pavement . `` god damn bolsheviki , '' cried the big soldier blacksmith . who had delivered the blow , there was a rumble of approval , the crowd closed in nearer . the jew staggered to his feet , and immediately went down again before a half dozen reaching in fists . this time he stayed down , breathing heavily , blood oozing from his lip where it was cut within and without .
at sixteen he , the youngest of one hundred and fifty candidates . passed his examination for admission to the army . and at the mature age of seventeen found himself a cornet in the royal horse guards . at this time his breast seems to have been fired by the noble ambition to become the strongest man in the world . how far he succeeded is told in well authenticated traditions that linger round various spots in windsor and [location] .
if it is indigestion , you will find it a most excellent remedy . the ghost glared at her in fury , and began at once to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog . an accomplishment for which he was justly renowned , and to which the family doctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of lord [organization] 's uncle , the hon , [male] . the sound of approaching footsteps , however , made him hesitate in his fell purpose . so he contented himself with becoming faintly phosphorescent , and vanished with a deep churchyard groan .
you and i , gentle reader , could teach these young folks a truer lesson . an we would , we know , alas , that the road of all the virtues does not lead to wealth . rather the contrary ; else how explain our limited incomes ? but would it be well . think you , to tell them bluntly the truth . that honesty is the most expensive luxury a man can indulge in .
little i ask ; my wants are few ; i only wish a hut of stone . ( a very plain brownstone will do , ) that i may call my own . and close at hand is such a one , in yonder street that fronts the sun . plain food is quite enough for me . three courses are as good as ten ; -- if nature can subsist on three .
sally looked at him with exasperation , ginger , i would like to slap you , ', she said . it was maddening , this intrusion of sentiment into business affairs . why , simply because he was a man and she was a woman . should she be restrained from investing money in a sound commercial undertaking ? if [location] had taken up this bone headed stand towards queen isabella .
about a minute before the clock struck , a hundred and fifty students swarmed in . rushed to their seats , immediately spread open their notebooks and dipped their pens in ink . when the clock began to strike , a burly professor entered . was received with a round of applause , moved swiftly down the center aisle . said `` gentlemen , '' and began to talk as he climbed his pulpit steps .
if counsellors , and other learned men , that are in love , do thus . what can the unlearned notary 's do less ? even nothing else . but when they are writing , scribble up a multiplicity of several words . unnecessary clauses , and make long periods ; not so much as touching or mentioning the principal business . and if he does , writes it clear contrary to the intent of the party concern would .
she is perfectly well bred , indeed , and has the air of a woman of fashion . but her manners are not such as can persuade me of her being prepossessed in my favour . i wanted her to be delighted at seeing me . i was as amiable as possible on the occasion , but all in vain . she does not like me , to be sure when we consider that i did take some pains to prevent my brother in law 's marrying her .
the swing was on the piazza under cover from the rain . so i obeyed , both boys fought for the right to swing first . and when i decided in favor of budge . toddie went off weeping , and declaring that he would look at his dear whay al anyhow . a moment later his wail changed to a piercing shriek .
the last hole had given [male] the honour again . he drove even more deliberately than before , for quite half a minute he stood over his ball . pawing at it with his driving iron like a cat investigating a tortoise . finally he despatched it to one of the few safe spots on the hillside . the drive from this tee has to be carefully calculated , for , if it be too straight .
i felt the same , i picked up the candle and lit it . and then a most fearful thing happened , the old man picked himself up . and suddenly collapsed into a chair and began to cry like a child , of course . i could see it was only the artistic temperament . but still , believe me , it was devilish unpleasant , i looked at old bill .
i received the news of your marriage with infinite delight . and hope that the sincerity with which i wish you happiness . may excuse the liberty i take in giving you a few rules . whereby more certainly to obtain it , i see you smile at my wrong headed kindness . and , reflecting on the charms of your bride , cry out in a rapture .
[female] , and appeared inclined to reply , but seeing it was useless , he left the office in silence . wondering more than ever ; and his bob wigg would friend slowly followed him , a jocund little [male] . with dark sparkling eyes and black glossy well curled poll , dressed in a carter 's frock . and heavy travel stained shoes , was brought in by some of the patrol , who had found him strolling about long acre . in the dusk of the evening , apparently without either aim or object .
we now go to the breakfast room . where the children are taught to set aside the daintiest bits for papa . because he might die some time and then it would be a life-long regret to those who are spared that they did not give him the tender part of the steer or the second joint of the hen . after breakfast , which consists of chops , hashed brown potatoes . muffins and coffee , preceded by canteloupe or baked beans .
in vain you surround yourself with newspaper and brown paper . and useless rubbish , tumbling your whole drawer into confusion . in vain you relinquish your nicely packed parcel . and see its contents scattered in all directions , in vain you grumble and scold . the ball is not forthcoming , your little brother has seized it to fly his kite .
and at last sir [male] ; and as he laughed he came and stood near [male] . and once he got his arm round her waist . and [female] was very happy , at the present moment she was quite indifferent to mr maguire and any mode of fighting that he might adopt . but some further annoyance he did give to [male] . he managed to induce mrs [female] to take him in as a lodger in gower street .
we took a turn around the town . after dinner , and found it fully as interesting in the moonlight as it had been in the daytime . the streets were narrow and roughly paved , and there was not a sidewalk or a street lamp anywhere . the dwellings were centuries old , and vast enough for hotels . they widened all the way up ; the stories projected further and further forward and aside as they ascended .
harrow house was a grim mansion on the outskirts of dover . it is better , of course , to be on the outskirts of dover than actually in it . but when you have said that you have said everything . [male] 's impressions of that portion of his life were made up almost entirely of chalk . chalk in the school room , chalk all over the country-side , chalk in the milk .
[location] has many names , and they are correctly descriptive . it is the land of contradictions . the land of subtlety and superstition . the land of wealth and poverty . the land of splendor and desolation .
after more months and months , in which first shame died and then fear . hope was born , and then came happiness , the old hunted look faded from the eyes of elsie . she seemed a superbly normal woman , save in one respect . during the political campaign of 1920 , when practically every visitor who came to the house would remark . at one time or other during the course of the evening .
mrs. [female] had always remembered affectionately their winter in [female] of ten years before . and she now expressed the feeling that if she were in [female] again she would be better . the doctors approved , and it was decided that she should be taken there as soon as she was strong enough to travel . she had so far improved by june that they journeyed to elmira . where in the quiet rest of quarry farm her strength returned somewhat and the hope of her recovery was strong .
ghosts of the finicking , `` high life '' sort are growing a trifle cheap . but here is a spook of another stamp , no thin , theatrical sham . but a spectre who fears not dirt nor damp : he rides on a [location] tram . by the curious glance of a mortal eye he is not seen . he 's heard , his steps go a creeping .
it lay as it had fallen , upon its side . and with one arm thrown out and one limb , the left , drawn up . not far from the outstretched right arm and hand lay the pistol . a six shooter , which the brother at once recognised , with two of the six chambers empty . a fact which mr. [male] had just discovered .
orion could pay nothing on the mortgage . financial matters becoming always worse , he could barely supply the plainest food and clothing for the family . [male] and [male] got no wages , of course . then real disaster came , a cow got into the office one night . upset a type case , and ate up two composition rollers .
major [female] had a short fit of aphasia . he opened and shut his mouth and foamed , then he took a half crown from his pocket . `` give that to the [male] , '' he said to his caddie . and without looking round , walked away in the direction of the tram . he had not gone a hundred yards when the whistle sounded .
at first the other juniors of the house were inclined to resent this extending of the right hand of fellowship to owners of studies and second eleven men . and attempted to make farnie see the sin and folly of his ways , but nature had endowed that youth with a fund of vitriolic repartee . when [male] , one of leicester 's juniors . evolved some laborious sarcasm on the subject of farnie 's swell friends . farnie , in a series of three remarks .
the scotsman 's flashed back a precisely similar message , men had fought for zuleika . but never in her presence , her eyes dilated , she had not the slightest impulse to throw herself between the two antagonists . indeed , she stepped back , so as not to be in the way , a short sharp fight . how much better that is than bad blood , she hoped the better man would win . and she rather hoped this man was the duke .
perhaps he kept her even closer than convention demanded . but he was very young , and he could not bear it to be said of him that he did not know how to treat a lady . or to manage a wife , and his own social position was uncertain , even in england a dentist is a troublesome creature . whom careful people find difficult to class , he hovers between the professions and the trades . he may be only a little lower than the doctors , or he may be down among the chemists .
their faces , in which the old roman fire scarcely flickers . brutalized with excess of every kind ; their heads of dishevelled hair bound with coronals of leaves . while , from goblets of an antique grace , they drain the fiery torrent which is destroying them . around the bacchanalian feast stand , lofty upon pedestals . the statues of old rome , looking , with marble calmness and the severity of a rebuke beyond words .
they done it , and soon as they was aboard i lit out for our towhead . and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off , shouting . we heard them come along towards the crick . but could not see them ; they seemed to stop and fool around a while . then , as we got further and further away all the time , we could not hardly hear them at all .
he also discovered the isochronism of the pendulum . he saw that the pendulum at certain seasons of the year looked yellow under the eyes . and that it drooped and did not enter into its work with the old zest . he began to study the case with the aid of his new bamboo telescope and wicker covered microscope . as a result , in ten days he had the pendulum on its feet again .
i had in the few words of introduction caught the name of sir [male] and others who had stood where i did at that moment . yes , -- but they were doubtless warned beforehand of what was expected of them . and therefore came prepared , i , on the other hand , stood there `` flabbergasted '' ! i confess i never felt so cornered . no , if i had been cornered -- but there on a platform to face the music !
hither and thither it swung . parting in swift haste the curious throng that encompassed it . and dragging the men about as if they were ounce weights . the wind seemed to be rising and the faces of the experienced aeronauts grew graver and graver . answers to the constantly repeated question , `` where is it likely to come down ? ''
i do not affirm that this is the whole truth , but i do affirm that we have too little comprehension of the souls of savages to know how far it is untrue . it is the same with the relations of our hasty and surface science . with the problem of sexual dignity and modesty . professors find all over the world fragmentary ceremonies in which the bride affects some sort of reluctance . hides from her husband , or runs away from him .
in 1880 we went still further , we went into the work of construing pronouns . there had been women in the quarterly conferences previously to that date . but there was a mist in the air with regard to their legality there . the general conference by its action did not propose to admit women to the quarterly conferences . it simply proposed to clear away the mist and recognize their legal right to sit in the quarterly conference .
a most dreadful chapter indeed ; and which few readers ought to venture upon in an evening . especially when alone , [male] swallowed a large mess of chicken . or rather cock , broth , with a very good appetite , as indeed he would have done the cock it was made of . with a pound of bacon into the bargain . and now , finding in himself no deficiency of either health or spirit .
our logical mikado , seeing no moral difference between the dignified judge who condemns a criminal to die . and the industrious mechanic who carries out the sentence , has rolled the two offices into one . and every judge is now his own executioner , nank . but how good of you ( for i see that you are a nobleman of the highest rank ) . to condescend to tell all this to me , a mere strolling minstrel , , do not mention it . i am , in point of fact , a particularly haughty and exclusive person .
there was a general and very ungallant burst of laughter at the broad guess . and poor mrs. [female] seemed a good deal confused . but at length the gentle [female] took upon her fair self to say that mrs. [female] 's mother was seventy eight . to her own certain knowledge , at last it was ordered that the young ladies . miss eliza pritchard and miss [female] , should find bail to keep the peace towards mrs. [male] .
they always put the pillows at the opposite end of the bed from the gas burner . so that while you read and smoke before sleeping ( as is the ancient and honored custom of bachelors ) . you have to hold your book aloft , in an uncomfortable position . to keep the light from dazzling your eyes , when they find the pillows removed to the other end of the bed in the morning . they receive not the suggestion in a friendly spirit .
it rejoiceth all mankind to behold in the sky the innumerable multitude of glittering stars . but it is a far surpassinger pleasure , that the new married couple receive . when they see vast heaps of silver and gold ly dazling their eys . and they lording over it , you , o lately married couple . possess this pleasure to the utmost .
yes , it would be even more unfair , for the alleged gay life of [location] touches at some point of contact or other the lives of most new yorkers . whereas in [location] there are numbers of sane and decent folks who seem to know nothing except by hearsay of what goes on after dark in the montmartre district . besides , no man in the course of a short and crowded stay may hope to get under the skin of any community . great or small , he merely skims its surface cuticle . he sees no deeper than the pores and the hair roots .
behind them was a curtain of dust rising sluggishly in the hot sky . marking the long convoy of other official vehicles pressing hard on the trail of the emergency truck . when the range road cut across the county highway . the driver paused long enough to see that the heaviest smoke concentrations from the unknown blast lay to the west . he swung left onto the oiled road and barreled westward .
this somewhat may be indeed resembled to the famous trunk maker in the playhouse ; for , whenever the person who is possessed of it doth what is right . no ravished or friendly spectator is so eager or so loud in his applause : on the contrary . when he doth wrong , no critic is so apt to hiss and explode him . to give a higher idea of the principle i mean . as well as one more familiar to the present age ; it may be considered as sitting on its throne in the mind .
[female] was now preparing to drive off from the first tee , he did this with great care . everyone who has seen [male] mealing play golf knows that his teeing off is one of the most impressive sights ever witnessed on the links . he tilted his cap over his eyes . waggled his club a little , shifted his feet , waggled his club some more . gazed keenly towards the horizon for a moment , waggled his club again .
if archer is a little overcautious in taking human life in the green goddess , the law of averages still prevails . for [male] has made up the deficit in diff are nt by rounding off his little play with a double hanging . this tragedy , described on the hoardings as `` a daring study of a sex starved woman , '' has much of [female] 's characteristic skill in stage idiom . but it is much less convincing than the same author 's the emperor [male] .
what 's that ? did i want to buy anything ? well , no , i had not exactly . i was just -- oh , i see , they are on sale . all right , yes , give me this one -- fifty cents -- all right . and this and these others , that 's all right , miss , i am not stingy . they always say of me up in our town that when i .
where he was deputy town clerk . a position which was as high as the town clerk of london—in fact , higher . he added that he was staying for a few days in [location] . with his uncle , mr. edgar paul [male] . he said he was sure his uncle would be only too pleased to see me .
there are still a good many of [location] left who go through life without doing anything much for our hands but with our feet it is different . they thrust themselves upon [location] so to speak . demanding care and attention , this goes for all sizes and all ages of feet . from the time you are a small boy and suffer from stone bruises in the summer and chilblains in the winter . on through life you are beset with corns and callouses and falling of the instep and all the other ills that feet are heir to .
this gentleman was an industrious prophet and did a good business in his line . he attracted much notice , and had all he could do at his trade for several weeks . many [location] people were frightened , especially as wiggins . the great intellectual sahara of the prophet industry . also prophesied a high wave which would rise at least above the bills at the palace hotel in [location] .
not that i really wanted the world to come to a end that day . no , i kinder wanted to live along for some time , for several reasons . my pardner , the babe , the children , etc , . and then i kinder like to live for the sake of livin ' , i enjoy it . wall , as the pinter approached the hour .
it amuses me now to think that it was a good half hour before i took the trouble to cut the string . fortune and happiness were waiting for me in that parcel . and i would not bother to open it , i sat in my chair . smoking and thinking , and occasionally cast a gloomy eye at the parcel . but i did not open it , then my pipe went out , and i found that i had no matches in my pocket .
his opening words , as he came on . were , `` ah , [male] , i have a note for you somewhere , '' which gave the audience an interval in which to welcome him . while he felt in all his pockets for the letter . one can bow quite easily while feeling in one 's pockets , and it is much more natural than stopping in the middle of an important speech in order to acknowledge any cheers .
i will bet [location] would have been glad to had such paths to walk on when he wuz foot sore . and tired out , they are made of a compound of granite and cement . and are as smooth as a board , and as durable as adamant , what a [male] sech roads would be in the spring and the fall ! how it would lessen profanity , and broken wagons . and broken backed horses , folks say that they will be used throughout the world .
the mournfulness of death was everywhere , i could not understand it . at last , in the further edge of that town i saw a small funeral procession . just a family and a few friends following a coffin , no priest . a funeral without bell , book , or candle . there was a church there close at hand , but they passed it by weeping .
the seventh day after the date of the telegram [location] came dreaming down to breakfast and was set wide awake by an electrical spasm of pleasure . here was the most beautiful young creature he had ever seen in his life . it was sally sellers lady gwendolen ; she had come in the night . and it seemed to him that her clothes were the prettiest and the daintiest he had ever looked upon . and the most exquisitely contrived and fashioned and combined , as to decorative trimmings , and fixings .
somebody has figured out that there are 2.983 more rapes in the average english 47 play than in the usual non collegiate specimen of commercial drama . we feel comparatively certain that there is nothing in the personality of professor [female] to account for this or in the traditions of harvard , either . we must admit that nowhere in the world is a woman quite so unsafe as in an english 47 play . but the faculty gives no official encouragement to this undergraduate enthusiasm for sex problems . one must look beyond the dean and the faculty for an explanation .
the dinner menu is changed on fridays . sundays and thursdays , on which days you get the soup first and the bread afterward . in this way the bread is saved , i asked for kumiss and a pony of benedictine . as my stone boudoir made me feel rocky . but it has not yet been sent up , somehow , while here , i can not forget poor old man dorrit .
in his efforts to run down a friend from the suburbs . [male] had consulted a hotel register . and seeing the name of the english lawyer , written by its owner just under his eye . he had first looked at the man , and then at the name . and , upon learning that he was an utter stranger to the city .
it is the unwritten law among travellers that a man 's luggage deposited upon a seat . shall secure that seat to him until he comes to sit upon it himself . this is a good law and a just law , and one that , in my normal state . i myself would die to uphold and maintain . but at three o'clock on a chilly morning one 's moral sensibilities are not properly developed .
[male] was nineteen and rather pitying with those of his friends who had not gone east to college . but , like most boys , he bragged tremendously about the girls of his city when he was away from it . there was genevieve ormonde , who regularly made the rounds of dances . house parties , and football games at [location] . [organization] , [female] , and cornell .
luckily , he had not set out to seek his fortune , but only to see something of the world . he lingered in [location] through the summer of 1853 . never expecting to remain long , his letters of that period were few , in october he said . in a letter to [male] , that he did not write to the family because he did not know their whereabouts . orion having sold the paper and left [male] .
for a dreadful moment or two it seemed as if no effect was to be produced . the animal simply stood and shivered , and ventimore began to feel an agonising suspicion that the jinnee really had . as he had first asserted , forgotten how to perform this particular incantation , all at once the mule reared . and began to beat the air frantically with his fore hoofs ; after which he fell heavily backward into the nearest armchair ( which was . fortunately , a solid and capacious piece of furniture ) with his fore legs hanging limply at his side .
some instants after , a damp warmth revived me . i was in the midst of clouds on fire . the balloon turned over with dizzy velocity , taken by the wind . it made a hundred leagues an hour in a horizontal course . the lightning flashing around it , meanwhile my fall was not a very rapid one .
and [organization] , meanwhile ? she , poor child . stared down the years into a bleak future , in which she saw herself parted for ever from the man she loved . and the golf widow of another for whom -- even when he won a medal for lowest net at a weekly handicap with a score of a hundred and three minus twenty-four . she could feel nothing warmer than respect . those were dreary days for [organization] , we three .
gros , exactly -- until i came here , that 's my grievance . i cut everybody out , i assure you . if you could only suggest some means whereby , consistently with my duty to society . i could escape these inconvenient attentions , you would earn my everlasting gratitude , bun . i will do so at once , however popular it may be with the world at large .
) [male] could scarcely sleep , so intense was his longing for sunday night . his desire to be safe in [location] with [male] joy ! nay , he could not properly eat ! and then the doubt entered his mind whether after all he would get to [location] on sunday night . for the [location] was lagging , she might have been doing it on purpose to ruin him .
still , there ai not nobody telling me to roust myself out from there and after a while i gets more used to being where i now is . also i gets acquainted with two of the porters , the one on our car and the one on the car which is hitched on next to us . when they ai not busy , we all three gets out in the little porches betwixt the cars and confabs together . course i do not let on to them . but all the time i studies them two boys .
the school revived , bowlers and field were infused with a new life . another wicket -- two stumps knocked out of the ground by [location] . helped the thing on , when the bell rang for the end of morning school . five wickets were down for a hundred and thirteen , but from the end of school till lunch things went very wrong indeed . [female] was still in at one end , invincible ; and at the other was the great wicket keeper .
does he live on turnips , tea , or tripe ? does he like his shawl to be marked with a stripe . or a dot , the akond of swat ? does he like to lie on his back in a boat like the lady who lived in that isle remote . shallott , the akond of swat ?
everything human is pathetic , the secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrow . there is no humor in heaven , -- pudd'nhead [female] 's new calendar . english law was hard hearted in those days , for trifling offenses which in our day would be punished by a small fine or a few days confinement , men , women , and boys were sent to this other end of the earth to serve terms of seven and fourteen years . and for serious crimes they were transported for life .
mistris lookabout was going to begin again ; but they heard such rapping and knocking at the dore . that one of them said i beleeve there are our husbands ; and indeed she guest very well . this augmented their mirth mightily , and especially of the nurse ; for now she was sure that . if the good cully her master treated his gossips nobly and liberally , her presents would be doubled . but nurse do not cheat your self , for fear it might happen otherwise .
then the bustle and confusion of the liner . the calm monotony of the journey . when one came on deck each morning to find the vessel so manifestly in the same spot where it had been the morning before that it was impossible to realize how many hundred miles of ocean had really been placed behind one . and finally the ambrose channel lightship and the great bulk of [location] rising into the sky like a city of fairyland . heartening yet sinister , at once a welcome and a menace .
now the full moon came masquerading among the branches of the shade trees . it came in the likeness of an enormous football , gloriously orange . gorgeously it rose higher , cleared the trees , and resumed its wonted impersonation of a silver disk . here was another mockery : what was the use of a moon now ? in direct coincidence with that rising moon , there came from a little distance down the street the sound of a young male voice , singing .
there was not even a bell or a speaking tube in the castle , i had a great many servants . and those that were on duty lolled in the anteroom ; and when i wanted one of them i had to go and call for him . there was no gas , there were no candles ; a bronze dish half full of boarding house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light . a lot of these hung along the walls and modified the dark . just toned it down enough to make it dismal , if you went out at night .
`` gentlemen , '' said the man in the chair . a howl of execration went up , and simultaneously the door was flung open . a double file of white robed druids came , chanting , into the room . the druids carried in with them a small portable tree which they proceeded to set upright . the chant now became extremely topical , each druid sang a verse in turn .
romeo must be gone before the first crowing of the cock and ere the rosy fingers of the dawn light up the bridal chamber . else death would be his portion , after the banishment of romeo . old capulet and his wife insisted that juliet marry young [location] . a kinsman of prince escalus . and sorrows unnumbered crowded on the new made secret bride , to escape marriage with [location] .
of the blaisdells mr. [female] saw a good deal that winter . they often came to miss [male] 's , and occasionally he called at their homes . mr. [male] was on excellent terms with them all . they seemed to regard him , indeed , as quite one of the family . and they asked his advice , and discussed their affairs before him with as much freedom as if he were .
the expression on her face changed suddenly , she was smiling a sad . gentle little smile , lady [male] , who had looked up at the approach of sir [male] and his entourage . relaxed again , but her eyes remained on [male] . `` you may approach , my lords , '' said the queen . sir [female] led the procession .
diamonds are not imbedded in rock ledges fifty miles long . like the johannesburg gold , but are distributed through the rubbish of a filled up well . so to speak , the well is rich , its walls are sharply defined ; outside of the walls are no diamonds . the well is a crater , and a large one , before it had been meddled with . its surface was even with the level plain .
the gentleman who had been all night tippling at the alehouse . was prevailed on by some arguments which a corporal had put into his hands . to undertake the same expedition , and now the portmanteau belonging to mr [male] being put up in the baggage cart . the forces were about to move forwards ; when the guide . stepping up to [male] , said , sir , i hope you will consider that the horses have been kept out all night .
now the gooseberry garden had two doors by which it might be entered . and once a small person like [male] could slip in there he could effectually disappear from view amid the masking growth of artichokes . raspberry canes , and fruit bushes . the aunt had many other things to do that afternoon . but she spent an hour or two in trivial gardening operations among flower beds and shrubberies .
nick goes in first , then the blonde , then the redhead and me . the minute things start getting scary , she tries to grab me . but i stick my hands in my pockets and say , `` aw , it 's just a picture . '' she looks disgusted , the next scary bit , she tries to hang onto her girl friend . but the blonde is already glued onto [location] , redhead lets out a loud sigh .
but all that apart , you want to get it firmly fixed in your mind that you are going to have a milligan over you all your life . and if it is not a milligan it will be a person or a smith . and the chances are that you will find them both harder to get along with than this old fellow . and if it is not milligan or person or smith . and you ai not a butcher , but a parson or a doctor .
5 , when the machine is rolled round to allow the spectators an examination of the back of the turk . and when his drapery is lifted up and the doors in the trunk and thigh thrown open . the interior of the trunk is seen to be crowded with machinery . in scrutinizing this machinery while the automaton was in motion . that is to say while the whole machine was moving on the castors , it appeared to [location] that certain portions of the mechanism changed their shape and position in a degree too great to be accounted for by the simple laws of perspective .
then there was the [female] and little red riding hood , the general impression seems to be that the child 's grandmother was a saintly old lady and that the [female] was a beast . let [location] dismiss this sentimental conception and consider the facts squarely . before meeting the [female] red riding hood was the usual empty headed flapper . she knew nothing of the world . so flagrant was her innocence that it constituted a positive menace to the community .
i felt my self very sensibly affected by the idea of our past intimacy . as we approached the place where we had spent so many happy days together . but when we arrived at the house , i could not recognize any one of those objects . which had been so deeply impressed upon my remembrance -- the tall oaks that shaded the avenue . had been cut down , and the iron gates at the end of it removed .
towards evening the sailors came to the same place where they had encamped over night . there had been no snow during the day , and they could recognize the imprint of their bodies on the ice . they again disposed themselves to sleep with their furs . penellan , much disturbed by the bad success of the expedition . was sleeping restlessly , when , at a waking moment , his attention was attracted by a dull rumbling .
he had looked for something tougher , something flashy and bloated . [male] , for his part , had taken an instant liking to the financier . he , too , had been misled by imagination , he had always supposed that these millionaires down wall street way were keen . aggressive fellows , with gimlet eyes and sharp tongues . on the boat he had only seen mr. [male] from afar .
so light was the touch of the coy little hand , that he glanced down to assure himself he had it on his arm . but his glance , stopping for an instant at the bright eyes . forgot its first design , and went no farther , they walked up and down three or four times . speaking about [male] and his mysterious employment , now that was a very natural and innocent subject , surely . then why , whenever ruth lifted up her eyes , did she let them fall again immediately .
it was now , also for the first time , that [male] touched upon future prospects in a practical manner . on the voyage he had been eloquent but sketchy , with the land of promise within biscuit throw and the tugs bustling about the great liner 's skirts like little dogs about their mistress . he descended to details , jill removed her gaze from the sky line with a start . jill listened to this programme with dismay . [location] was calling to her , and brookport held out no attractions at all , she looked down over the side at the tugs puffing their way through the broken blocks of ice that reminded her of a cocoanut candy familiar to her childhood .
if i remember rightly it only occupied a couple of hours . therefore i judge that the distance was very little , if any , over fifty miles . we quitted the train at oos . and walked the entire remaining distance to [location] , with the exception of a lift of less than an hour which we got on a passing wagon . the weather being exhaustingly warm , we came into town on foot .
we are now thrown into the maelstrom of contradictory historical data . some of which credits wiglaf with being the greatest ruler [male] ever had and some of which indicates that he was nothing but a royal bum . it is not the purpose of this biography to try to settle the dispute . all we know for a fact is that he was a very human man who had faults like the rest of [location] and that shortly after becoming king he disappears from view . his reign began at four p.m. one wednesday afternoon and early the next morning [male] was overrun by the west saxons .
we no longer lock a man up for doing something . we lock him up in the hope of his doing nothing . given this principle , it is evidently possible to make the mere conditions of punishment more moderate . or -- more secret , there may really be more mercy in the prison , on condition that there is less justice in the court . i should not be surprised if , before we are done with all this , a man was allowed to smoke in prison .
yet there was some alleviation to the first overwhelming paroxysm of my sorrow . i found , upon trial , that the powers of utterance which . upon my inability to proceed in the conversation with my wife . i then concluded to be totally destroyed , were in fact only partially impeded , and i discovered that had i . at that interesting crisis , dropped my voice to a singularly deep guttural .
[female] bent low over a rose bush . his face was hidden , but the brown of his neck seemed to take on a richer hue . and his ears were undeniably crimson , his feet moved restlessly , and from his unseen mouth there proceeded the first gallant speech his lips had ever framed . merely considered as a speech , it was , perhaps , nothing wonderful . but from [male] it was a miracle of chivalry and polish .
it was a glorious spring afternoon . the courts were crowded , the red earth and the green grass formed a background against which the women . in their new parisian toilets , under their bright parasols , stood out like wondrous bouquets of moving flowers . the whole atmosphere was a delightful mingling of idle gaiety . flirtation , and graceful sensuousness , a modern watteau would have seized upon the scene with avidity .
built me a shelter against the rain . but could not have it to myself in peace , the new creature intruded . when i tried to put it out it shed water out of the holes it looks with . and wiped it away with the back of its paws . and made a noise such as some of the other animals make when they are in distress .
he wondered if mrs. [female] had been in time to cash the cheque . if not , of course his executors would pay the amount . but there would be delays , long delays , mrs. [female] in meshes of red tape . red tape for her , green weeds for him . he smiled at this poor conceit , classifying it as a fair sample of merman 's wit .
always counteracting the good impulses , ever prompting the bad ones of his beast ? and have you not , while heartily wishing yourself in the saddle . felt the utter inutility of administering any counsels to the rider ? you saw , and rightly saw , that even if he attempted to follow your suggestions . he would do so awkwardly and inaptly , acting at wrong moments and without that continuity of purpose which must ever accompany an act of address .
i am not very certain of the secret doctrine of this sect in the matter . but , as far as i can make out , `` efficiency '' means that we ought to discover everything about a machine except what it is for . there has arisen in our time a most singular fancy : the fancy that when things go very wrong we need a practical man . it would be far truer to say , that when things go very wrong we need an unpractical man . certainly , at least , we need a theorist , a practical man means a man accustomed to mere daily practice .
owen plunged on with his story , he started from its dim beginning . from the days when he had bought the novel on his journey from bath to cheltenham . he described his methods of work . his registering of the package , his suspense . his growing resignation , he sketched the progress of his life .
food itself has been the subject of change both in the matter of material and preparation . this must affect the consumer in such a way as to some day bring about great differences . take , for instance , the [male] , one of our comparatively modern food and game fishes . and watch the effects of science upon him . at one time the [male] browsed around and ate what he could find in [male] 's back yard .
she hesitated , she stood still , fighting herself . but the grain of dust had done its work . for an instant she ceased to be a smoothly working machine and became a woman subject to the dictates of impulse . intuition had not deceived her , ruth had gone over to the enemy . she was in kirk 's arms .
no doubt it can be justified as clearly as fox hunting . if the fox eats chickens , the butterfly 's child eats vegetables . if fox hunting improves the breed of horses , butterfly hunting improves the health of boys . but at least , we never told ourselves that butterflies liked being pursued , as foxes like being hunted . we were moderately honest about it , and we comforted ourselves in the end with the assurance of many eminent naturalists that `` insects do not feel pain . ''
but we know what a mad creature you are anyway . so we simply suspected some deep laid twit , now i come to the queerest thing of all ! [female] went out last night , for her usual saturday evening off , and has not returned ! in all the years she 's been with us . mother says , it 's the first time such a thing ever happened .
though tilling with all its perspicacity could not have known it , the intuitive reader will certainly have perceived that miss [female] 's party for wednesday night had . so to speak , further irons in its fire , it had originally been a bribe to [female] . in order to induce her to spread broadcast that that ridiculous rumour had been promptly denied by the person whom it most immediately concerned . it served a second purpose in showing that miss [female] was too high above the mire of scandal . however interesting , to know or care who might happen to be wallowing in it .
unconscious that mrs. [male] , like nemesis . was dogging his steps , [male] continued his way until finally he turned into arloes road . on reaching the second lamp post he gave vent to a peculiarly shrill whistle . as he opened the gate that led to a neat little house . the front door opened , and a young girl ran down the path and clasped his arm .
i changed the conversation by asking where the goblin was , although they all talked a great deal about the amusing time they had had . i could not gather that they had really accomplished much , [male] claimed to have seen fred . and said he looked like a rotter , we drank kathleen 's health a couple of times . and then the other three sat down to dummy bridge , i slipped away to the public library . partly to get some more of my antiquarian information about wolverhampton , and partly because i knew my absence would disquiet them .
he dropped cautiously into [male] 's garden . ran lightly across it , and was in the lane within a minute . there he paused , dusted his trousers , which had suffered on the two walls . and strolled meditatively in the direction of the town , half past ten had just chimed from the school clock . he was in plenty of time .
it exists , it continues to sparkle , and is well taken care of . it is exhibit a in the church 's assets . and we pull it out every sunday and give it an airing . but you are not permitted to try to smuggle it into this discussion . where it is irrelevant and would not feel at home , it is strictly religious furniture .
the tourists in the highlands will find no more beautiful spot than the glen of aucherlocherty . nor is there any spot which can more justly claim to be historic ground . it was here in the glen that [male] prince [male] had lain and hidden after the defeat of culloden . almost in the same spot the great boulder still stands behind which the bruce had laid hidden after bannockburn . while behind a number of lesser stones the covenanters had concealed themselves during the height of the stuart persecution .
there was a sudden shuffle of feet on the pavement . a quick movement on the part of the kid . a chunky sound as of wood striking wood . and the man smith had been addressing fell to the ground in a heap . as he fell , something dropped from his hand on to the pavement with a bump and a rattle .
there is another point i wish to notice , the general conference of 1880 did not see the effect that legislation would have by admitting women to certain offices . certain affirmative legislation is also negative legislation , when saloons are permitted to sell in quantities of one gallon . it forbids to sell in quantities of less than one gallon . when it says you can sell in quantities of one barrel . it forbids them to sell in quantities of two .
[male] knew that he was not the other one referred to , and he reluctantly followed . grumbling about long distances and various veins , although upon the high road . both mrs. [female] and mr. [male] were what [male] regarded as `` a bit jumpy . '' from time to time they looked about them with obvious apprehension . as if anticipating that from every point of the compass a bull was preparing to charge down upon them .
[male] , his son , carried on the [male] works . and emily kept house for [female] , she with her own hand had made this pudding . but for her this pudding would not have been , fantastic , utterly incredible , and yet so it was . she was grown-up , she was mistress of the house . she could make or unmake puddings at will , and yet she was emily [male] .
even with regard to the parts of the figure which are more exposed to observation by the closer adaptation of dress . much deception occurs , it is , therefore , necessary to understand the arts employed for this purpose . at least by skilful women , a person having a narrow face . wears a bonnet with wide front , exposing the lower part of the cheeks. . one having a broad face , wears a closer front .
this was something definite , something that had to be attended to quick , i was up with a jump , yelling . [male] rolled off my back and woke up , and he sat there listening . while i stood with my front paws on him and shouted at the men . i was bristling all over , i did not know who they were or what they wanted . but the way i looked at it was that anything could happen in those woods at that time of night .
everybody remembers the tale of dorkins of the welsh fusileers and his appointment to the department of the poloese . how his term of office was to be six years . and how by the time his credentials reached him his term of office had expired . so with findlayson , on the very date of the expiration of his desired leave he received permission to go . and of course could not then do so , because it was too late , fortunately for findlayson .
the room being furnished , and the club ready to commence operations . it was deemed expedient to select an individual of superior physical strength to attend to the door . lest some intruding outsider might sometime interrupt the deliberations of the honorable quadrupedal order . mr. [male] elected himself to this dignified and honorable office . and , under the belief that his brawny arms were eminently suited to do duty in case of the irruption of sacrilegious outsiders upon the sanctified premises .
the pessimist is commonly spoken of as the man in revolt . he is not , firstly , because it requires some cheerfulness to continue in revolt . and secondly , because pessimism appeals to the weaker side of everybody . and the pessimist , therefore , drives as roaring a trade as the publican . the person who is really in revolt is the optimist .
i go around to twenty first street and case forty six . which is a pretty fair looking building with a striped awning and a doorman who saunters out front and looks around every few minutes . while i am watching , a grocery boy comes along pushing his cart and goes down some stairs into the basement with his carton of groceries . this gives me an idea , i will give the boy time to get started up in the elevator . and then i will go down in the basement and hunt for cat .
never had mr pecksniff been beheld in a more pleasant humour , but when he walked into the parlour where the old man was engaged as [male] had said . with pen and ink and paper on a table close at hand ( for mr pecksniff was always very particular to have him well supplied with writing materials ) . he became less cheerful , he was not angry , he was not vindictive . he was not cross , he was not moody , but he was grieved . he was sorely grieved , as he sat down by the old man 's side .
while the band approached , penrod marked the time with his feet . then he fell into step and accompanied the musicians down the street . keeping as near as possible to the little man with the big horn , there were four or five other boys . strangers , also marching with the band , but these were light spirits . their flushed faces and prancing legs proving that they were merely in a state of emotional reaction to music .
from the standpoint of the historian it spoiled the whole affair . but for the postponement , readers of this history might . nay , would -- have been able to absorb a vivid and masterly account of the great struggle . with a careful description of the tactics by which victory was achieved . they would have been told the disposition of the various regiments .
regarding the sun 's temperature , sir [male] says that it is sufficient to melt a shell of ice covering its entire surface to a depth of 40 feet . i do not know whether he made this experiment personally or hired a man to do it for him . the sun is like the star spangled banner . as it is `` still there. '' you get up tomorrow morning just before sunrise and look away toward the east . and keep on looking in that direction , and at last you will see a fine sight .
at this moment the door opened and [female] stood before the [female] . gwendoline never forgot what happened , through her life the picture of it haunted her . her lover upright at the door , his fine [male] gaze fixed inquiringly on the diamond pin in her father 's necktie . and he , her father , raising from the mantelpiece a face of agonized amazement , you , you ! ', he gasped . for a moment he stood to his full height .
some of the magazines upon the very library table at home were sprinkled with pictures of people pointing pistols at other people . nay , the library board of the town had emitted a `` selected list of fifteen books for boys , '' and penrod had read fourteen of them with pleasure . but as the fifteenth contained no weapons in the earlier chapters and held forth little prospect of any shooting at all . he abandoned it halfway , and read the most sanguinary of the other fourteen over again .
brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking . of private understanding even , between [male] churchill and [male] . he had walked up one day after dinner . as he very often did , to spend his evening at hartfield . emma and harriet were going to walk ; he joined them .
it has been well said that in this world there is always something . a moment before , lady wetherby had been feeling completely contented , without a care on her horizon . it was foolish of her to have expected such a state of things to last . for what is life but a series of sharp corners . round each of which fate lies in wait for [location] with a stuffed eel skin ?
`` passage , passage , '' cried the companions of [organization] . at first terrified , but soon recovering , when they found they had only to do with two men . but those two men were hundred armed giants ; the swords flew about in their hands like the burning glaive of the archangel . they pierce with its point , strike with the flat . cut with the edge ; every stroke brings down a man .
for an instant his hopes rose high , surely the impostor had been found out at last . and the envelope would contain an urgent invitation to him to come back and resume his rights . an invitation which he might show to the doctor as his best apology . but when he looked at the address , which was `` master [male] bultitude , '' he felt a misgiving , it was unlikely that [male] would address him thus if she knew the truth .
`` now the point about the wasp , '' he writes . `` is that he does not want to sting you , '' of still less moment to the world than the wrongs of the wasp are his motives and intentions . any wasp who stings me will be wasting his time if he lingers around after the deed to explain . `` i did not want to do it , '' still , the whole trick of the essayist is to pick side alley subjects . selecting at random from windfalls , there are on a hansom cab .
from my readings of works of fiction describing the daily life of the english upper classes i know full well that the picture gallery is lined with family portraits . that each canvased countenance there shows the haughtily aquiline but slightly catarrhal nose . which is a heritage of this house ; that each pair of dark and brooding eyes hide in their depths the shadow of that dread nemesis which . through all the fateful centuries , has dogged this brave but ill starred race until now , alas ! the place must be let , furnished , to some beastly creature in trade .
again the look of affright in the dull eyes . the arm lifted as in self protection , and the only word they could coax from his lips was , `` ghost ! '' uttered in evident fear and trembling , and this was repeated at the inquest . this , and no more , from [female] , mrs. [female] . [female] landlady , told how the dead man had appeared at breakfast .
very clever , my dear , but some day you will be sorry , no man . [male] , likes a woman to have independent views . [female] can afford to have independent views ; she has an independent income . she earns it , all the same , i wish i had gone to college . i wish i had learned a profession , what have these new women accomplished ?
each little pig dug a hole for himself . just as a hen does when she wants to take a dust bath . squinty dug his hole near the lower edge of the boards . on one side of the pen , and , as squinty dug down . he noticed that he could see under the bottom of the boards .
lupin is discharged , we are in great trouble . lupin gets engaged elsewhere at a handsome salary , this morning i receive a letter from [female] . informing me that lupin 's services are no longer required . and an interview with me is desired at eleven o clock . i went down to the office with an aching heart . dreading an interview with mr. [male] .
the baron allowed him time to put on a pair of breeches wrong side out . the cook came , and you could hear her panting all the way down from the attic . out came the nine house maids with hair in curl papers . the seven footmen followed , [male] and welsby had forgotten their wigs . the coachman and grooms and stable boys came in horse blankets and boots .
`` call up police headquarters , '' he said . still holding his stomach as if fearful that it might become detached , `` and tell them there 's a riot here . '' meanwhile [male] had decided that , as victory perched on his banners . it was time to state the terms on which he would permit the enemy to surrender . but he was too wise to put himself in the enemy 's power before these terms were settled .
`` nothing ever happens to me , '' she reflected . as she entered the piazza signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels . now fairly familiar to her , the great square was in shadow ; the sunshine had come too late to strike it . [male] was already unsubstantial in the twilight , half god . half ghost , and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge .
they stood for an instant , listening apparently , the man no longer carried the sack . they exchanged a few inaudible words , then they crossed the clearing and entered the wood a few yards to his right . he could hear the crackling of their footsteps diminishing in the direction of the road . a devouring curiosity seized upon mr pickering . he wanted , more than he had wanted almost anything before in his life .
they have been voting sixteen years , and only now , when the logical result of the right of suffrage that the general conference gave to women appears and confronts [location] by women coming here to vote as delegates . do we rise up and protest , i believe that it is at the wrong time that the protest comes . it should have come when the right to vote was granted to women in the church . it is sixteen years too late , and as was very wisely said by dr. potts . the objection comes not so much from the constitution of the church as from the `` constitution of the men , ''
he longed for moral courage to stand out boldly and refuse to leave town . but , as we have seen , it was beyond his powers . and he temporised , very soon the whistle had sounded and the train had begun to glide slowly out beyond the platform and arch . past the signal boxes and long low sheds and offices which are the suburbs of a large terminus . and then it was too late , for some time after they were fairly started the doctor read his evening paper with an air of impartial but severe criticism .
the servants said they would follow the fashion . a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance . they would scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls . and then the evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible , it was a kind of satire on nature . it was the scientific method , the geologic method .
this stupendous blank is hot , not to say torrid ; a part of it is fertile . the rest is desert ; it is not liberally watered ; it has no towns . one has only to cross the mountains of new south wales and descend into the westward lying regions to find that he has left the choice climate behind him . and found a new one of a quite different character , in fact , he would not know by the thermometer that he was not in the blistering plains of [location] . [male] , the great explorer , gives [location] a sample of the heat .
a correct letter to the lost and found department of a periodical , inquiring for a missing relative . this should be referred to the persons mentioned in the letter who will probably take prompt and vigorous action . i have been very much interested in the clever work of nancy and [female] which has been appearing in your magazine . and i wonder if you could take the time to give me a little piece of information about them . you see there was a nancy [female] ( her mother was nancy kroomen of beaver dam ) .
its arrowy star recalled the car then winding round the wood . and lime rock gray threw back the ray across the rapid flood . though cold each form , their love , still warm , from hearth and lattice glows . hearts kind and dear yet linger here . and bid [location] to repose , the skies are dark !
there is no doubt of the superiority of this parisian simplicity . to me , when it broke upon me in reading la mode parisienne . it came as a kind of inspiration . i took away the stuffy black ribbon with its stupidly elaborate knot from my canadian christie hat and wound a single black ostrich feather about it fastened with just the plainest silver aigrette . when i had put that on and pinned a piece of old lace to the tail of my coat with just one safety pin .
she went to judge driscoll 's kitchen first of all . she was received there in great form and with vast enthusiasm . her wonderful travels , and the strange countries she had seen . and the adventures she had had , made her a marvel and a heroine of romance . the negros hung enchanted upon a great story of her experiences .
fenn seemed to be able to do what he pleased with the bowling . [male] he played with a shade more respect than the others . but he never failed to score a three or a single off the last ball of each of his overs . the figures on the telegraph board rose from twenty to thirty . from thirty to forty , from forty to fifty , [male] went on at the lower end instead of challis .
and he knows , no doubt , all about you and my sister in law . how you came and married her when she was another man 's wife . and took her away when you knew as that other man was alive and kicking ? mr. [male] , when these questions were put to him . remained silent , because literally he did not know how to answer them , he was quite prepared to take his position as he found it .
but they did at last touch the heart of a woman . that woman believed him , while the rest of [location] sneered at him . had she lived , [location] would not have been sent to prison in chains . no , indeed , but she passed away , and [location] misused him . but now they send their royalties to meet with all the kings and queens of the earth to bow down to his memory .
in the height of the tourist season it is not always possible for one who wishes to leave [location] to spring on to the next boat . a long morning 's telephoning to the offices of the cunard and the white star brought mrs. [female] the depressing information that it would be a full week before she could sail for england . that meant that the inflammable eustace would have over two weeks to conduct an uninterrupted wooing . and mrs. [female] 's heart sank . till suddenly she remembered that so poor a sailor as her son was not likely to have had leisure for any strolling on the deck during the voyage of the atlantic .
and then [female] threw both rudder lines over board . and burst into tears , how they got back [female] never knew . but it took them just forty minutes . a dense crowd watched the entertainment from kew bridge with much interest . and everybody shouted out to them different directions .
was finally voted out and down , robinson , [male] , brother of [male] . he claimed distinction simply because some people were sufficiently clever to do things before his name could be pronounced . rockefeller , [male] , an [location] who endeavored to drive his camel through the eye of a needle by giving advice . building churches and colleges . and squeezing competitors , like all millionaires , he was born penniless .
after lunch his mother and his sister [female] . a pretty girl of nineteen , dressed him for the sacrifice . they stood him near his mother 's bedroom window and did what they would to him . during the earlier anguishes of the process he was mute . exceeding the pathos of the stricken calf in the shambles .
i never saw anybody look so happy and pleased with herself , her eyes were like lamps . and her cheeks all pink , and she was going at it like a champion . i knew what had made a hit with the people , it was the look of her . she made you think of fresh milk and new laid eggs and birds singing . to see her was like getting away to the country in august , it 's funny about people who live in the city .
on the present occasion mr bailey . being in spirits , was more than commonly hard upon his charge ; in consequence of which that fiery animal confined himself almost entirely to his hind legs in displaying his paces . and constantly got himself into positions with reference to the cabriolet that very much amazed the passengers in the street . but mr bailey , not at all disturbed , had still a shower of pleasantries to bestow on any one who crossed his path . as , calling to a full grown coal heaver in a wagon , who for a moment blocked the way .
it was in the middle of andy 's second year at college that the old man had the stroke which put him out of business . he went down under it as if he would been hit with an axe . and the doctor tells him he will never be able to leave his bed again . so they sent for andy , and he quit his college . and come back to [location] to look after the restaurant , i was sorry for the kid .
two ladies asked mr stumfold questions with great pertinacity . and these questions mr stumfold answered very freely , walking about the room the while . and laughing often as he submitted himself to their interrogations . and miss mackenzie was much astonished at the special freedom of his manner . how he spoke of st paul as paul .
the fame of this illustrious ebony lady had gone abroad through the land . and her skill in prophecy had been vouched for by those who professed to have personal knowledge of the truthfulness of her predictions . but an air of mystery surrounded the sable sorceress . and it was declared to be impossible to obtain a knowledge of her exact whereabouts . except by a preliminary visit to a certain mysterious `` cave , '' the locality of which was accurately described .
in later years , reading seems to have been regarded as a handy place to run down to . when matters were becoming unpleasant in [location] , parliament generally rushed off to reading whenever there was a plague on at westminster . and , in 1625 , the law followed suit , and all the courts were held at reading . it must have been worth while having a mere ordinary plague now and then in [location] to get rid of both the lawyers and the parliament . during the parliamentary struggle , reading was besieged by the earl of essex .
nuphsed , who was sitting on the bank of the custard lake . was nearly frightened into fits by this sight ; and he ran to tell the king that a new meteor had fallen and ruined one of his floating islands . thereupon the monarch and several of his courtiers rushed out and found prince zingle swimming ashore . and the king was so delighted at seeing his lost son again that he clasped him joyfully in his arms . the next moment he regretted this act .
his treatment of adair 's next over was freer . he had got a sight of the ball now . [male] through the over a beautiful square cut forced a passage through the crowd by the pavilion . and dashed up against the rails , he drove the sixth ball past cover for three . the crowd was now reluctantly dispersing to its own games , but it stopped as mr .
i have carefully read and pondered over the dissertation on progressive euchre which you send me . algernon , and i can not see why it should not be ravenously seized and copied by the press of the broad . wide land referred to in your letters , if you have time . perhaps it would be well enough to go to the leading journalists of our country and ask them what they mean by it . you might write till your vertebrae fell out of your clothes on the floor .
upon [male] 's return from his trying hour with the lawyers . he had been besieged with questions , but he was cleverly evasive . peggy alone was insistent ; she had curbed her curiosity until they were on the way home . and then she implored him to tell her what had happened , the misery he had endured was as nothing to his reckoning with the woman who had the right to expect fair treatment . his duty was clear , but the strain had been heavy and it was not easy to meet it .
i ai not a going to tell all that happened -- it would make me sick again if i was to do that . i wished i had not ever come ashore that night to see such things . i ai not ever going to get shut of them . lots of times i dream about them . i stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark .
early in the next round the white corps student got an ugly wound on the side of his head and gave his opponent one like it . in the third round the latter received another bad wound in the head . and the former had his under lip divided , after that , the white corps student gave many severe wounds . but got none of the consequence in return . at the end of five minutes from the beginning of the duel the surgeon stopped it .
it was noticeable that the party thus distinguished did not seem precisely overwhelmed with pleasure at the compliment . which , as they knew from experience , implied considerable exertion on their part . and even disgrace if they were unsuccessful , the other side too looked unhappy , feeling themselves in a position of extreme delicacy and embarrassment . for if they played their best , they ran some risk of offending the doctor . or , what was worse , drawing him over into their ranks ; while if .
just like that , and picking out the most sumptuous and attractive of the flattered young ladies in waiting . and sinking easily into the chair opposite her -- see photos of [female] and throwing the coat lapels back . at the same time resting the left hand clenched upon the upper thigh with the elbow well out . [female] asking a lady to waltz -- and offering the right hand to the favored female and telling her to go as far as she likes with it . it sounds simple when you figuring it out alone .
it would surely be too late for any glimpse of his heroine . and his mind was already cluttered with impressions from his day 's adventure . he went out through the office , meaning to thank the casting director for the great favour she had shown him . but she was gone , he hoped the headache had not driven her home . if she were to suffer again he hoped it would be some morning .
i began to fear then that climatic influences had been at work on the seeds . but i had not fully given up all hope , at first the plants seemed to waver and hesitate over whether they had better be wild parsnips or lima beans . then i concluded that they had decided to be foliage plants or rhubarb . but they did not try to live up to their portraits , pretty soon i discovered that they had no bugs which seemed to go with them . and then i knew they were weeds , things that are good to eat always have bugs and worms on them .
she and wally would come together with a smile and build their life on an enduring foundation of laughter and happiness and good fellowship . wally had never shaken and never would shake her senses as derek had done , if that was love . then she did not love wally , but her clear vision told her that it was not love . it might be the blazing and crackling of thorns . but it was not the fire , she wanted wally .
the canticle , for a moment interrupted by these words . was about to recommence , and would not , apparently , have soon come to an end . had not the performers been disturbed by violent knocks at the door . monipodio hastened to see who was there , and found one of his sentinels , who informed him that at the end of the street was the alcalde of criminal justice . with the little piebald and the kestrel ( two catchpolls .
i inwardly insisted , and i think partly believed , that my lung power was too great for the capacity of my throat opening , hence pants . i cast a pitying eye at other men . deep of girth and purple of face . waddling down the platform , and as i scudded on past them i would say to myself that after all there was a tremendous difference between being obese and being merely well fleshed out . the real reason of course was that my legs had remained reasonably firm and trim while the torso was inflating .
it occurred to [organization] that if the honourable [male] pogram had stayed at home . and sent his shoes upon a tour , they would have answered the same purpose . for they were the only part of him in a situation to see anything . in course of time , however , mr pogram rose . and having ejected certain plugging consequences which would have impeded his articulation .
what harm would this innocent deception do to anyone ? mcfadden , even if he ever knew , would have no right to complain . he had given up all pretentions himself and if he was merely anxious to preserve his reputation . his wishes would be more than carried out , for i flattered myself that whatever ideal chlorine might have formed of her destined suitor . i should come much nearer to it than poor mcfadden could ever have done .
to deal plainly with the reader , the [male] , ever since his arrival . at least from the moment his brother had proposed the match to him . long before he had discovered any flattering symptoms in miss bridget . had been greatly enamoured ; that is to say , of mr allworthy 's house and gardens . and of his lands , tenements , and hereditaments .
you can see by these things that she was of a rather vain and frivolous character . still , she had virtues , and enough to make up , i think , she had a kind heart and gentle ways . and never harbored resentments for injuries done her . but put them easily out of her mind and forgot them . and she taught her children her kindly way .
burgess , accordingly , had resolved to fill up the first eleven just a week before ripton visited wrykyn . there were two vacancies , one gave him no trouble . neville smith was not a great bowler , but he was steady . and he had done well in the earlier matches , he had fairly earned his place . but the choice between [male] and [male] had kept him awake into the small hours two nights in succession .
[male] started his minuet cake walk , in the hope that it might see something more sensational . the ball was well up , slow , and off the wicket on the on side . perhaps if it had been allowed to pitch , it might have broken in and become quite dangerous . [male] went out at it , and hit it a couple of feet from the ground . the ball dropped with a [location] and a spurting of dust in the road that ran along one side of the cricket field .
they were interrupted , tea was carrying round . and mr. [male] , having said all that he wanted . soon took the opportunity of walking away , after tea , mr. and mrs. [female] . and mr. [male] sat down with mr. [female] to cards . the remaining five were left to their own powers , and emma doubted their getting on very well .
i took up the receiver again and gave another call . there was no reply , i am afraid so , i said , what shall we do ? ', said audrey . she looked at me hopefully , as if i were a mine of ideas . her voice was level , without a suggestion of fear in it . women have the gift of being courageous at times when they might legitimately give way .
the inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in complicating it in every way he could think of . for instance , if one is casually referring to a house , haus , or a horse . pferd , or a dog , hund , he spells these words as i have indicated . but if he is referring to them in the dative case . he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary e and spells them hause .
into this abode of lotus eaters came clephane . a day boy , owing to the departure of his parents for [location] . clephane wanted to go to donaldson 's , in fact , he said so . his expressions , indeed , when he found that the whole thing had been settled . and that he was to spend his last term at school at a house which had never turned out so much as a member of the gym .
only once in her life had [organization] met her stepfather 's celebrated aunt . and the meeting had taken place nearly twelve years ago . the figure that remained in her memory was of a pale eyed , grenadier like old lady . almost entirely surrounded by clocks , it was these clocks that had impressed her most . she was too young to be awed by the knowledge that the tall old woman who stared at her just like a sandy cat she had once possessed was one of the three richest women in the whole wide world .
there were a number of pitches dotted about over the field . for there was always a touch of the [location] park about it on mid term service day . adair , as [male] of cricket . had naturally selected the best for his own match , it was a good wicket , [male] saw . as a matter of fact the wickets at sedleigh were nearly always good .
you tell him what day you will start . and whither you are going -- leave all the rest to him . you need not inquire about trains , or fares . or car changes , or hotels . or anything else , at the proper time he will put you in a cab or an omnibus .
for , of course , i wanted to take presents home to my family . very little question was there what these presents should be , -- for i had no boys nor brothers . the women of the confederacy had one want . which overtopped all others , they could make coffee out of beans . pins they had from [location] ; straw hats they braided quite well with their own fair hands .
if there is any thing on earth i hate . it is a genius , your geniuses are all arrant asses . the greater the genius the greater the ass -- and to this rule there is no exception whatever . especially , you can not make a man of business out of a genius . any more than money out of a jew , or the best nutmegs out of pine knots .
the variations of the above bill are trifling , after a fortnight one discovers that the variations are only apparent , not real . in the third week you get what you had the first . and in the fourth the week you get what you had the second . three or four months of this weary sameness will kill the robustest appetite . fresh [location] fruits of all sorts .
how would it have been with him if his life had been different . if he had become , perhaps , a clergyman and had married [male] ? or if he had become anything but what he was with her for his wife ? he knew that his life had been a failure . that the best of it was gone , and that even the best of it had been unsatisfactory .
but the boom is short lived , presently a crisis arises in some other department of our national life . something cataclysmal happens to [organization] , or the hippodrome . or tottenham hotspur , public attention is diverted . the correspondence is closed with cruel abruptness ; and little [male] is summoned from the picture palace . and sent to another school or provided with a private tutor , still , his good name and fair fame are now vindicated in the eyes of the world .
he has been reincarnated more times than shiva . and he has kept a sample of each incarnation . and fused it into his constitution , in the course of his evolutionary promotions . his sublime march toward ultimate perfection , he has been a gambler . a low comedian , a dissolute priest .
i knew this , because i remembered what he had said about it . he got on the good side of ursula . he praised her to marget , confidentially , but speaking just loud enough for ursula to hear . he said she was a fine woman . and he hoped some day to bring her and his uncle together .
they walked in silence round the edge of the lake . and holed out , one putt was enough for each , and they halved the hole with a two . person 's previous record was eight , and person had once done a seven . there are times when strong men lose their self control . and this was one of them , they reached the third tee in a daze .
we really had not the least notion , of course you had not . how could you ? come , come , my good fellow , do not distress yourself . it was no fault of yours . if a man of exalted rank chooses to disguise himself as a second trombone . he must take the consequences , it really distresses me to see you take on so .
the fabric of civilized life is interwoven with blackmail . even some of the noblest people do favours for other people who are depended upon not to tell somebody something that the noblest people have done . blackmail is born into [location] all , and our nurses teach [location] more blackmail by threatening to tell our parents if we wo not do this and that . and our parents threaten to tell the doctor -- and so we learn ! blackmail is part of the daily life of a child .
he broke off , for derek , freeing his arm with a wrench . turned and walked rapidly away , derek had no desire to go over the whole thing again with [male] . he wanted to be alone , to build up , painfully and laboriously , the ruins of his self esteem . the pride of the underhills had had a bad evening . for a moment [male] stood motionless .
i stood leaning over the gaff of the mainsail and thinking . yes , thinking , dear reader , of my mother , i hope that you will think none the less of me for that . whenever things look dark , i lean up against something and think of mother . if they get positively black , i stand on one leg and think of father . after that i can face anything , did i think .
partridge having now lost his wife , his school . and his annuity , and the unknown person having now discontinued the last mentioned charity . resolved to change the scene , and left the country , where he was in danger of starving . with the universal compassion of all his neighbours , a short sketch of that felicity which prudent couples may extract from hatred . with a short apology for those people who overlook imperfections in their friends .
a body of men under colonel prescott . after prayer by the president of [organization] . marched to charlestown neck , they decided to fortify breed 's hill . as it was more commanding , and all night long they kept on fortifying . the surprise of the english at daylight was well worth going from lowell to witness .
and here , at the risk of being guilty of a digression , i must pause to record my admiration for this exceedingly happy form of compromise . which is , i think , peculiar to the british and , to a certain extent . the [location] nations , it has many developments . ranging from the mild transatlantic compound of cookery and camp meetings . to the semi novel , redeemed and chastened by an arrangement which sandwiches a sermon or a biblical lecture between each chapter of the story .
a man from vinegar hill named [male] and a party called soiled [male] . were in my office one morning -- mr. [male] as a witness . and mr. [male] in his great specialty as a drunk and disorderly . we had just disposed of the case , and had just stepped down from the bench . intending to take off the judicial ermine and put some more coal in the stove .
his fight with [male] at madison square garden was advertised as being for the lightweight championship of the world . as a matter of fact much more than that was at stake . spiritually , saint saens , brander matthews . [male] , kenyon [male] . and [male] cabot lodge were in benny [male] 's corner .
`` of course , of course , certainly , where did i put my -- ah , here . '' he seized his hat , and by way of economizing effort . knocked his stick on to the floor with the same movement . mrs [organization] watched his bendings and gropings with growing impatience . till finally he rose , a little flushed but with a full hand -- stick , gloves .
he had been diffident when he teed off with mccay in the first round . but , finding that he defeated the secretary with ease . he met one butler in the second round with more confidence . butler , too , he routed ; with the result that . by the time he faced sigsbee in round three .
but it was from the priesthood that the real , serious opposition was to be expected . and the priests of the sixty seven gods of oom were up in arms . as the white bearded high priest of hec , who by virtue of his office was generally regarded as leader of the guild . remarked in a glowing speech at an extraordinary meeting of the priests equity association , he had always set his face against the principle of the closed shop hitherto .
such people as observed him were interested , but did not conclude that he was mad . this aftermath of conversation is not unknown in [location] . he tried to think how amusing it was ; but it would not do . miss abbott 's presence affected him too personally . either she suspected him of dishonesty .
i merely wish to show some of the [male] imperfect attempts at the use of our tongue . there are many letters in the book ; poverty imploring help . bread , money , kindness , office -- generally an office . a clerkship , some way to get food and a rag out of the applicant 's unmarketable education . and food not for himself alone , but sometimes for a dozen helpless relations in addition to his own family .
while all this was going on i lost track of my location . the car began to squirm around all over [location] , and finally the conductor came back and wanted more money . i said no , i would get off and try a dark red car with a green stomach for a while . so i did i rode on that till i had seen a great deal of new scenery . and then i asked the conductor if he passed number clankety clank , blank street .
the other , not less magnificently attired , wore an imperial portrait suspended by a chain around her neck . and a small knot of white and green ribbon on her shoulder . to denote her quality of a lady in waiting at court . there was something almost queenly in the haughty dignity of her manner . and an air of command in the tone with which she addressed her companion .
i felt as if i had stepped on the place where the last stair ought to have been . but was not , i felt defiant , if you know what i mean , and there did not seem anything to defy . `` all right , then , '' i said , and then he went away to collect his kit . while i started in again on `` types of ethical theory '' and took a stab at a chapter headed `` idiopsychological ethics . ''
it was a full minute after [female] 's first exclamation of surprise before either of them spoke again . the light of the torch hurt [female] 's eyes . she put up a hand , to shade them . it seemed to her that they had been standing like this for years . [male] had not moved , there was something in his attitude that filled [male] with a vague fear .
my parents desired me to leave off the trade of stone cutting and prepare for the priesthood . where i could make an easier living , working on the fears . egotism and hopes of mankind . most of the dramatic writers during the reigns of person the eighth . person , person the first , and person second .
after that it took only a moment 's further scrutiny for the princess to discover that [female] was going to be happy too . then she found that there was a man connected with [male] . and colonel [female] 's hand . to which she transferred her gaze . trembled with delightful anticipation , she seemed to see a man there .
he withdrew with another bow and without a word . opening the door no wider than was sufficient for his passage out ; and shutting it as carefully as before . the chairman of the board employed the rest of the morning in affixing his sign manual of gracious acceptance to various new proposals of annuity purchase and assurance . the company was looking up , for they flowed in gayly . it was with a faltering hand , and yet with an imbecile attempt at a swagger .
he abandoned his intention of ringing up the haymarket theatre . and turning away from the call box , walked meditatively down the aisle till he came to the fixed deposits department . where the top of mr [male] 's head was to be seen over the glass barrier . as he applied himself to his work . psmith , resting his elbows on the top of the barrier and holding his head between his hands .
but a benevolent providence has ordained that aunts can not call for ever . and it is on record that when [male] entered his box on the two hundredth night of that great [location] success . fate 's footballs , he did not enter it alone . it is possible , too , that , being there , you decided that you might as well go the whole hog and be manicured at the same time . it is not unlikely , moreover , that when you had got over the first shock of finding your hands so unexpectedly large and red .
true , i did figure , rather prominently , too , in one county match . it was at the oval , surrey v , middlesex . how well i remember that occasion , [male] was bowling ; i forget who was batting . suddenly the ball came soaring in my direction , i was not nervous . i put down the sandwich i was eating .
yes , of course it 's personal -- but consider the antithetical humor of the situation . king : of course , now i see it ! thank you very much , i was sure it had its humorous side . and it was very dull of me not to have seen it before . but , as i said just now , it 's a [male] world .
the new caste will help to modify the despotism of the old : that is all . and undoubtedly the system breeds initiative , which is not the strong point of the average schoolboy . in the army everyone looks automatically for instruction to the soldier of highest rank present . whether he be a brigadier in charge of a field day or the oldest soldier of three privates engaged in guarding a gap in a hedge . it is these low grade delegations of authority which force initiative and responsibility upon boys who otherwise would shrink from putting themselves forward .
after that , for the remainder of his stay , they were always together . they walked in the woods , they sat by the silvery lake . he poured out the treasures of his learning for her . and she looked at him with reverent eyes . uttering from time to time a soft `` yes '' or a musical `` gee ! ''
[male] is not artistic , [male] does not go with peacocks feathers and guitars , i can see [male] with a single peacock 's feather atgiles 's fair . when the bulldogs are not looking ; but the decorative panel of peacock 's feathers is too much for him . i can imagine him with a banjo . but a guitar decorated with pink ribbons , to begin with he is not dressed for it .
his head was proudly up ; he was the incarnation of menacing power and of self confidence . it is possible that the whitefish 's spinal column and flopping tail had interfered with his vision . and in launching himself he may have mistaken the dark . round opening of the cistern for its dark , round cover . in that case , it was a leap calculated and executed with precision .
a thermometer must always be treated with care , for the mercury once spilt can only be replaced with great difficulty . it is considered to be one of the most awkward things to pick up after dinner . and only a very steady hand will be successful , some people with a gift for handling mercury or alcohol make their own thermometers . but even when you have got the stuff into the tube . it is always a question where to put the little figures .
i have often admired your scholarly and spiritual expressions , and your modest life . and you will remember that at one time i asked you for your autograph . and you told me to go where the worm dieth not and the fire department is ineffectual . will you not , i ask , aid a struggler and panter for fame . who desires the eye of the public , even if his own be italicised at the same time ?
[female] , the next man in , was a promising rather than an effective bat . he had an excellent style , but he was uncertain . ( two years later , when he captained the wrykyn teams . he made a lot of runs . ) but this season his batting had been spasmodic , today he never looked like settling down .
try as he might to lose consciousness . the recollection of the plot he had discovered surged up and kept him wakeful . it is the penalty of the suspicious type of mind that it suffers from its own activity . from the moment he detected mr. [male] in the act of rifling the museum and marked down ashe as an accomplice . baxter 's repose was doomed , nor poppy nor [male] .
the fact is , i was a very fair amateur locksmith . and had quite a fondness for fixing , picking , and fussing generally over locks . accordingly , when he gave me a lock to work upon to make it `` play easier , '' as he described it , i did the job so satisfactorily that i had nearly every lock in the prison to take off and operate upon . if it was nothing more than to clean and oil one .
crops around [location] are looking well , winter wheat . crocusses and indefinite postponements were never in a more thrifty condition . quite a number of people are here who are waiting to be confirmed , judging from their habits . they are lingering around here in order to become confirmed drunkards . i leave here tomorrow with a large , wet towel in my plug hat .
so here , at cost of reading twenty lines . i am landed , so to speak , at the beginning of the seventh chapter . why do not i set to work to read it ? the sub editor has spoiled me . my fear is lest this sort of thing shall lead to a demand on the part of the public for condensed novels . what busy man is going to spend a week of evenings reading a book when a nice kind sub editor is prepared in five minutes to tell him what it is all about !
our country has always been noted in its interest in fishin ' , why , at the internatial exhibition at [location] in 1880 . [location] won the first prize given by the emperor for its display . and i knew when it done so well on a foreign shore , it wuz not goin to make any failure of itself here under its own line . and fish tree , so to speak , wall , as i said .
without having paid particular attention to the subject , she could probably have given a correct rendering of the way in which he pronounced certain words occurring in the responses . while he was well aware of the trivial fact that , in addition to her prayer book and handkerchief . a small paper packet of throat lozenges always reposed on the seat beside her . miss [female] rarely had recourse to her lozenges . but in case she should be taken with a fit of coughing she wished to have the emergency duly provided for .
i sat there for nearly half an hour , waiting for him to make his entrance . until i suddenly discovered he had been on from the start , he was . in fact , the rummy looking plug ugly who was now leaning against a potted palm a couple of feet from the o.p . side , trying to appear intelligent while the heroine sang a song about love being like something which for the moment has slipped my memory . after the second refrain he began to dance in company with a dozen other equally weird birds .
they remained for a time in [location] . a period of honors and entertainment . if mark twain had been a lion on his first visit . he was hardly less than royalty now , his rooms at the langham hotel were like a court . the nation 's most distinguished men -- among them [male] .
gravity and absent mindedness followed , and then melancholy . two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep . but it was a false hope ; no [female] came . at last she grew entirely miserable and wished she had not carried it so far . when poor [male] , seeing that he was losing her .
and even when the first years are past and a position of comparative prominence attained . the danger of presumption is not outdistanced , a boy obtains his house colours . we will say , his friends congratulate him warmly . and then sit down to wait for symptoms of `` side , '' the newly born celebrity must walk warily . too often he trips , our first success in life is very .
what was beyond i could not tell , the space between the front and the back was not more than a few yards . it was a desperate venture , and yet i must take it . every instant the beating of those hurrying hoofs was louder and louder . i put my arab at the pig sty . she cleared the front beautifully and came down with her forefeet upon the sleeping pig within .
bindle and cissie boye went to the victim 's assistance . and bindle removed the basin , it parted from mr. [male] 's head with a juicy sob of reluctance . whilst his rescuers were occupied in their samaritan efforts . mrs. [female] was engaged in describing her husband 's character . beginning with a request for someone to end his poisonous existence .
fate never planned a coup so successfully , the psychology of [female] 's arrival was perfect . the boxers of carnation [female] had worked themselves into a mental condition which i knew was as ridiculous as it was dangerous . their conceit and their imagination transformed the [female] into a kind of improved national sporting club . they went about with an air of subdued but tremendous athleticism . they affected a sort of self-conscious nonchalance .
the sun shone , and the wide blue hill views and pleasant valleys one saw on either hand from the sandscarred roadway . even the sides of the road itself set about with grey heather scrub and prickly masses of gorse . and pine trees with their year 's growth still bright green . against the darkened needles of the previous years , were fresh and delightful to mr. [male] 's eyes but the brightness of the day and the day old sense of freedom fought an uphill fight against his intolerable vexation at that abominable encounter . and had still to win it when he reached haslemere , a great brown shadow .
i have said , however , that there was a small farm house immediately in front of us . as we rode up to it i observed that a fine grey horse with a military saddle was tethered by the door . instantly i galloped forward , but before i could reach it a man dashed out of the door . flung himself on to the horse . and rode furiously away , the crisp , dry snow flying up in a cloud behind him .
monk hereupon demanded a week for consideration . now , lambert could not refuse this : and lambert , nevertheless , had come saying that he should devour monk 's army . therefore , at the end of the interview , which lambert 's party watched with impatience . nothing was decided -- neither treaty nor battle . the rebel army , as m. d'artagnan had foreseen .
there are ways of curing you of almost any habit except manicuring . you get so that you are not satisfied unless your nails run down about a quarter of an inch further than nails were originally intended to run . and unless they glitter freely you feel strangely distraught in company . inasmuch as no male creature 's finger nails will glitter with the desired degree of brilliancy for more than twenty-four short and fleeting hours after a treatment you find yourself constantly in the act of either just getting a manicure or just getting over one . it is an expensive habit , too ; it takes time and it takes money .
one says that the man hurled the bills in the direction of the deck . and that was exactly what he did , but the years had robbed his pitching arm of the limber strength which . forty summers back , had made him the terror of opposing boys ', baseball teams . he still retained a fair control but he lacked steam . the handkerchief with its precious contents shot in a graceful arc towards the deck .
for ages his name was placed on the presidential ballot and later removed , made a fortune by telling people why they did not elect him . also toured the world , but shot no game in [location] or monte [male] . was the father of bryanism , an odious word meaning things [male] . later secured one [male] to attend to [location] detail work . motto : all things come to him with bait .
now , laughing and shouting as they run , the children , the sons and daughters of the slaves . be industrious , little children , and learn your lessons , that when the time comes you may be ready to take from our hands the creaking oar . to slip into our seat at the roaring loom . for we shall not be slaves for ever , little children . it is the good law of the land .
from the top he reconnoitered carefully , waved his hand . and whispered , `` ok , '' then slipped over , [male] climbed up and i followed . and we rather shivered to see how far down that swaying , wavering figure dropped . hand under hand , till it disappeared in a mass of foliage far below . then there were three quick pulls , and [male] and i .
`` i am sorry , '' she said again . [male] looked over his shoulder , down the lower terrace was approaching the long form of his lordship . he walked with pensive jerkiness , not as one hurrying to a welcome tryst . as [male] looked , he vanished behind the great clump of laurels that stood on the lowest terrace . in another minute , he would reappear round them .
about midway between wrykyn , the school . and wrykyn , the town , there stands on an island in the centre of the road a solitary lamp post . it was the custom , and had been the custom for generations back . for the diners to trudge off to this lamp post , dance round it for some minutes singing the school song or whatever happened to be the popular song of the moment . and then race back to their houses , antiquity had given the custom a sort of sanctity .
`` 's that ? '' shouted mid on , mid on has a habit of appealing for l. b. w. in school matches . [male] freece said nothing . [organization] was as conscientious in the matter of appeals as a good bowler should be . he had seen that the ball had pitched off the leg stump . the umpire shook his head , mid on tried to look as if he had not spoken .
he had been looking past her out into the room . wally had been lifting his glass , he put it down rather suddenly . he raised his glass again , and drank its contents quickly . jill looked at her companion anxiously , recent events had caused her completely to forget the existence of lady underhill . she was always so intensely interested in what she happened to be doing at the moment that she often suffered these temporary lapses of memory .
the latter theory was the correct one , montagu webster was a man who at many a subscription ball had shaken a wicked dancing pump . and nothing in the proper circumstances pleased him better than to exercise the skill which had become his as the result of twelve private lessons at half a crown a visit . but he recognized the truth of the scriptural adage that there is a time for dancing . and that this was not it , his only desire when , stealing into the drawing room he had been confronted through the curtains by a female figure . was to get back to his bedroom undetected , he supposed that one of the feminine members of [organization] must have been taking a stroll in the grounds .
she found herself facing ginger 's cousin . the dark man of yesterday 's episode on the beach , bruce [male] . mr. [male] was not a man who readily allowed himself to be disturbed by life 's little surprises . but at the present moment he could not help feeling slightly dazed , he recognized sally now as the french girl who had attracted his cousin lancelot 's notice on the beach . at least he had assumed that she was french , and it was startling to be addressed by her now in fluent english .
still , i was not absolutely penniless , and she was her own mistress . and i had some cause , as i have said . for believing that she was , at least , not ill disposed towards me . it seemed a favourable sign , for instance . when she asked me one day why it was i never rode .
`` merci , monsieur. '' he goes out . the audience feel a thrill of pride at having learned french and being able to follow the intense realism of this dialogue . the maid lays the letter on the supper table . just as she does it the door opens and there enter mr. [male] and lady cicely . yes , them , both of them , the audience catches it like a flash .
with a view to bringing some relief to the guests at entertainments of this kind . i have endeavoured to construct one or two little winter pastimes of a novel character . they are quite inexpensive , and as they need no background of higher arithmetic or ancient history . they are within reach of the humblest intellect . here is one of them , it is called indoor football .
she was apparelled , principally , in a red flannel jacket . and a check handkerchief , which was passed under her chin and tied on the top of her wig . where the knot looked like a blue butterfly , there was a gown , but a series of subsoiling experiments would have been necessary to determine the material and texture . the surface was palpably dirt , accompanying her there was a strong smell of gin . and from the odor of the liquor the visitor judged that it was a very poor article .
that was all -- and daphne did not think it would do much for her . and besides , people might want to know who the queen of märchenland was . which would be awkward to explain , but perhaps the court godmother would see that she was not sent home without funds enough to support her till she could get an engagement . she would be rather sorry to leave märchenland , which , queer country as it was in some ways . she had come to look upon her home , however , she did not worry much about the future .
the school filed out of the [male] to their various lunches , and mr . [male] was left with the conviction that , if he wanted the criminal discovered . he would have to discover him for himself . the great thing in affairs of this kind is to get a good start . and fate , feeling perhaps that it had been a little hard upon mr .
so [female] , rising at the call of time from the bed on which he sat . came up to the scratch warily , [male] , on the other hand . having everything to gain and nothing to lose , and happy in the knowledge that no amount of bruises could do him any harm . except physically , came on with the evident intention of making a hurricane fight of it . he had very little science as a boxer .
he looked at her , and , as he looked . he heard [location] calling to him . mervo , by the appeal of its novelty . had caused him to forget , but now , quite suddenly , he knew that he was homesick . and it astonished him , the readiness with which he had permitted mr. [male] to lead him away into bondage .
the swallow tail coat hung limp and weary in the wardrobe . and the gross receipts of the evening were under my pillow . i needed sleep , for i was worn out with travel and anxiety . but the fear of being robbed kept me from repose . i know how desperate a man becomes when he yearns for another 's gold .
although he pledged himself to this with perfect confidence . he was in a state of unbounded astonishment even now . [male] appeared to observe it , and to have some sense of the ludicrous bearing of mr tapley under these perplexing circumstances . for , in spite of the composure of his voice and the gravity of his face . the same indistinct light flickered on the latter several times , mark bestirred himself .
on the dais was [female] dancing . she was dressed in some white soft fabric shimmering with silver . which left her beautiful arms bare to the shoulder . it was cut squarely and simply about the neck , and hung in straight folds down to just above her ankles . she held in her hands some long shimmering scarf of brilliant red .
as for the boxes , they behaved with their accustomed politeness . most of them were attending to something else , some of those few who regarded the scene at all . declared he was a bad kind of man . while others refused to give their opinion , till they had heard that of the best judges . now we , who are admitted behind the scenes of this great theatre of nature ( and no author ought to write anything besides dictionaries and spelling books who hath not this privilege ) .
blackstone says that an ordeal might always be tried by attorney . i should think this would give the legal profession a very lively time whenever the courts were chiefly using tigers . poison , drowning , fire and red hot iron . but not so much so when a little swearing or eating was the only thing required . this whole business of ordeals is a singular superstition .
death is ever a surprise , even at the end of a long illness and after a ripe old age . to those who are near it seems abrupt ; so to his grand children some of whom survived him . his children having died of old age , the death of [male] came like a thunderbolt from a clear sky . [male] succeeded in cording up more of a record such as it was . than any other man of whom history informs us .
the civil regulations of this kingdom and metropolis are taken from very different models from those of england . except in a few particular establishments , the necessary consequences of the union . their college of justice is a bench of great dignity . filled with judges of character and ability . i have heard some causes tried before this venerable tribunal .
and now , as he was enquiring in the street after his wife . and had just received directions to the door , unfortunately mr [male] was issuing from it . fitzpatrick did not yet recollect the face of [male] ; however , seeing a young well-dressed fellow coming from his wife . he made directly up to him , and asked him what he had been doing in that house ? for i am sure , said he , you must have been in it .
in concluding the discussion we ventured to ask his highness for his autograph . the prince , who has perhaps a more exquisite sense of humour than any other sovereign of [location] . declared with a laugh that he had no pen . still roaring over this inimitable drollery , we begged the prince to honour [location] by using our own fountain pen . `` is there any ink in it ? '' asked the prince .
she was so little acquainted with the geography of the island . that she imagined we could not go to [location] but by sea . and , after we had passed through the town of berwick . when he told her we were upon scottish ground . she could hardly believe the assertion -- if the truth must be told .
colonel theodore [male] was a speaker of somewhat the same type . he did not talk well unless there was some living and present person for him to speak against . upon one occasion we heard him make a particularly dreary discourse . and incidentally a political one , until he came to a point where a group in the audience took exception to some statement and attempted to howl him down . it was like the touch of a whip on the flanks of a stake horse .
i should tell you that [female] 's chief interest in life was the decipherment of the inscriptions on her cradle . the [female] case which had rocked her ancestors since [female] 's time . and which is now in your possession , of itself it is a sufficient proof of the accuracy of this narrative . the [female] case is not the ordinary coffin of egyptian commerce . the hieroglyphics have baffled dr. [female] .
the noise , coming after the dead silence , frightened her till she realized what it was . she had a nervous feeling of not being alone , it was as if the shadows held goblins that peered out at the intruder . she darted to the mantelpiece and replaced the photograph . she felt like some heroine of a fairy story meddling with the contents of the giant 's castle . soon there would come the sound of a great footstep [location] .
person and myself took a boat up the nile to [location] . and hired a guide to steer [location] over the desert to the far famed pyramids . there in the wild waste of desert sands these monuments to forgotten kings and queens lift their giant peaks . appealing to the centuries for recognition , but although the great granite stone memorials still remain as a wonder to mankind . the dark , silent mummies that sleep within and around these funereal emblems give back no sure voice as to when and where they lived .
somewhere out in the darkness into which mr. [male] and aline had already vanished in a large automobile . lay the castle , with its butler and its fearful code of etiquette . soon the cart that was to convey him and the trunks thither would be arriving , he shivered . out of the gloom and into the feeble rays of the oil lamp came joan valentine . she had been away , tucking aline into the car .
punctually every night at 11 o'clock mr. [male] strolled from the desk of the `` rotunda '' to the door of the bar . if it seemed properly full of people and all was bright and cheerful , then he closed it . if not , he kept it open a few minutes longer till he had enough people inside to warrant closing . but never , never unless he was assured that pepperleigh , the judge of the court . and macartney , the prosecuting attorney , were both safely in the bar .
in the middle of his second year , he had gone so far that a college meeting had to be held . and he was sent down for the rest of term . the warden placed his own landau at the disposal of the illustrious young exile . who therein was driven to the station , followed by a long , vociferous procession of undergraduates in cabs . now , it happened that this was a time of political excitement in [location] .
[organization] , in a sleeveless vest that showed up his chest and shoulders was not an inviting spectacle for a man intending assault and battery . bailey decided to confine himself to words . there was nothing to be gained by a vulgar brawl . a dignified man of the world avoided violence . it was at this point that [male] .
whatever may be the rights and wrongs of this mode of classification . there can be no doubt about one most practical and disastrous effect of it . these lighter or wilder forms of art , having no standard set up for them . no gust of generous artistic pride to lift them up . do actually tend to become as bad as they are supposed to be , neglected children of the great mother .
on the next morning miss mackenzie trembled in her shoes as she came down to breakfast . her uncle , whom she feared the most , would not be there ; but the meeting with her aunt . when her aunt would know that she was a pauper and that she had for the last week been an impostor . was terrible to her by anticipation , but she had not calculated that her aunt 's triumph in this newly acquired wealth for the ball family would . for the present , cover any other feeling that might exist , her aunt met her with a gracious smile .
old pump and aldgate clutches at the bargain . and a comfortable thing it is to think that birth can be bought for money . so you learn to value it . why should we , who do not possess it , set a higher store on it than those who do ? perhaps the best use of that book , the `` peerage , ''
before the door , however , the mass of anxious spectators . rolled back against the walls , had become more thick , and closed up the way . [organization] and his men , who were dragging along the culprits . were within ten paces of the door , [organization] made a last effort , `` passage , passage ! '' cried he , pistol in hand .
we all of us , even the greatest of us . have our moments of weakness , only a short while back . in this very room , we have seen [female] hubbard . that indomitable girl , sobbing brokenly on the carpet , let [location] then not express any surprise at the sudden collapse of one of the world 's greatest female thinkers . as the meaning of this speech smote on mrs. [female] understanding .
the russian horsemen dismounted , and my poor fellows were ordered to do the same . it was already late , and it was clearly their intention to spend the night in this village . there were great cheering and joy amongst the peasants when they understood that we had all been taken . and they flocked out of their houses with flaming torches . the women carrying out tea and brandy for the cossacks .
disappointment was , however , their lot , the meeting passed over quietly . and neither the objectionable matter nor speaker was brought forward , however much his friends regretted this circumstance . o'leary was himself sincerely pleased ; for he never desired to give unnecessary pain . the gentlemen in concert with whom he acted . dined together after the meeting , and the conversation happening to turn on the disappointment which they had experienced in the result of the debate .
`` you had better consent , sir , '' said [male] very gently , `` yes , sir , you had better consent , '' added a very different voice , [male] gave a little jump . and the others turned to the direction from which it had come . it was the voice of mr .
[female] 's last impression of the departing one was of a vast and greasy grin . stretching most of the way across his face , [male] , as blackmailer . in which role he now showed himself . differed in some respects from the conventional blackmailer of fiction . it may be that he was doubtful as to how much [male] would stand .
it was at this time discovered that the crazed sailors had gotten the delusion that the [male] had a million dollar in gold concealed aft . and they were conspiring to kill him and the two passengers and seize it. , m.t . this establishment 's name is hochberghaus , it is in bohemia . a short day 's journey from [location] . and being in the austrian empire is of course a health resort .
why did not my father buy them for me . as pets , for my birthday and let me keep them till i grew up ? if i had my life over again , no school or education for me ! not with all this beautiful mud and these tar paper shacks and corner lot fruit stores lying round ! i would buy out the whole united states and take a chance .
this created a storm , all the germans in austria were incensed . in numbers they form but a fourth part of the empire 's population . but they urge that the country 's public business should be conducted in one common tongue . and that tongue a world language -- which german is , then the music began . badeni 's voyage , instead of being smooth , was disappointingly rough from the start .
there are those , however , who , remembering the multi millionaire 's well-known eccentricities , are suspecting him of living in quiet retirement somewhere . laughing in his sleeve at the tempest in the teapot that he has created . and that long before the two years are up , he will be back on [location] 's streets . debonair and smiling as ever , the fact that so little can be found in regard to the south [location] exploring expedition might give color to this suspicion . but where on this terrestrial ball could mr. [male] find a place to live in unreported retirement ?
it did not , then he spied through the larger window upon the yard . to see whether the wall of the new rooms which he had lately added to his house showed any further trace of damp . and whether the new chauffeur was washing the new motor car with all his heart . the wall showed no further trace of damp . and the new chauffeur 's bent back seemed to symbolize an extreme conscientiousness .
it is done quietly ; they do not nag and pester and harass [location] for contributions . they give [location] peace . and set [location] an example -- an example which he have not found ourselves able to follow . for by nature we are not free givers . and have to be patiently and persistently hunted down in the interest of the unfortunate .
what noble deeds were we not ripe for in the days when we loved ? what noble lives could we not have lived for her sake ? our love was a religion we could have died for . it was no mere human creature like ourselves that we adored . it was a queen that we paid homage to .
it was since the war that i met general sherman . and it was on the line of the union pacific railway . at one of those justly celebrated eating houses , which i understand are now abandoned , the colored waiter had cut off a strip of the omelette with a pair of shears . the scorched oatmeal had been passed around , the little rubber door mats fried in butter and called pancakes had been dealt around the table . and the cashier at the end of the [male] had just gone through the clothes of a party from vermont .
paul might never have gained heart to venture . but for an unpleasant incident that took place during dinner and a discovery he made after it . they happened to have a particularly unpopular pudding that day . a pallid preparation of suet , with an infrequent currant or two embalmed in it . and paul was staring at his portion of this delicacy disconsolately enough .
[male] , who had gone outside , was noted for his skill at the game . and we were determined to give him something difficult . something which had not a camel or a glass house or a stable door in it . after some discussion a member of the company suggested a proverb from the persian . as he alleged , it went something like this .
there should never be any trouble about getting a suitable person to serve [location] at the kaiser 's court if the administration at [location] will but harken to the voice of experience . to the germans the late doctor tanner would have been a distinct disappointment in an ambassadorial capacity . but there was a man who used to live in my congressional district who could qualify in a holy minute if he were still alive . he was one of nature 's noblemen . untutored but naturally gifted , and his name was [male] , he was the champion eater of the world .
let [location] now examine history , and see what it teaches . in the four battles fought in 1881 and the two fought by jameson . the british loss in killed , wounded , and prisoners , was substantially 1,300 men . the boer loss , as far as is ascertainable , was about 30 men . these figures show that there was a defect somewhere , it was not in the absence of courage .
The Regent by [female] at Loyal Books.txt `` and yet , '' [male] machin reflected as at six minutes to six he approached his own dwelling at the top of bleakridge . `` and yet -- i do not feel so jolly after all , '' the first two words of this disturbing meditation had reference to the fact that . by telephoning twice to his stockbrokers at manchester , he had just made the sum of three hundred and forty-one pounds in a purely speculative transaction concerning rubber shares . ( it was in the autumn of the great gambling year , 1910 .
when the visit was returned , emma made up her mind . she could then see more and judge better , from harriet 's happening not to be at hartfield . and her father 's being present to engage mr. [male] , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation to herself . and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs. [female] was a vain woman . extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior .
the season for hunting i see has begun , so adieu for a time to my rod and my gun , and ho ! for the fox , be he wild or in bag . as i follow the chase on my high mettled nag . i call him high mettled , but still i must state , he has not a habit i always did hate . he does not walk sideways , like some `` gees '' you meet .
the `` gifted brazilian astrologist '' regarded the suggestion with a favorable eye . for the model soon reappeared and showed the searcher after hidden knowledge into a bedroom nearly dark . wherein were several dresses hanging on the wall , a bed . two chairs , a table , and madame carzo . the light was so arranged as to fall directly in the face of the stranger .
at last frocks ceased to appear , and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps . he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer , then one more frock passed in at the gate . and [male] 's heart gave a great bound . the next instant he was out , and `` going on '' like an indian . yelling , laughing , chasing boys , jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb .
but perry , peering through the uncertain eyes of the camel . saw only her face , radiant , animated , and glowing with excitement . and her arms and shoulders , whose mobile . expressive gestures made her always the outstanding figure in any group . he was fascinated and his fascination exercised a sobering effect on him .
`` doctor , '' i said , covering my face with my hands . `` i am a confirmed soda fiend , '' he gave me a long lecture and a longer list of instructions . i must take air and exercise and i must become a total abstainer from sundaes of all descriptions . i must avoid limeade like the plague . and if anybody offered me a bulgarzoon i was to knock him down and shout for the nearest policeman .
but by and by , while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances . he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house . [female] came up to the fence and leaned on it . grieving , and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer , she halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door . [female] heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold .
and softly mother and child go out into the sunlit garden , in alcala , as in most of [location] apartment houses . the schedule of prices is like a badly rolled cigarette . thick in the middle and thin at both ends . the rooms half-way up are expensive ; some of them almost as expensive as if fashion . instead of being gone for ever , were still lingering , the top rooms are cheap .
i parted from him at the door , as a comforter he had failed to qualify . he had not eased my mind to the slightest extent . looking at it now i can see that the days which followed audrey 's arrival at sanstead marked the true beginning of our acquaintanceship . before , during our engagement , we had been strangers . artificially tied together , and she had struggled against the chain , but now , for the first time .
[female] made a humiliating apology , swore eternal friendship to boggs . introduced him to van dam and spout . and invited the party to his room to spoil a snifter from his private bottle . they accepted the invitation with commendable alacrity . and soon arrived at mr. [male] 's cozy apartment .
they were indeed her last words that evening . and they impressed the hairdresser , in spite of himself . custom habituates the mind to any marvel . and already he had overcome his first horror at the periodical awakenings of the statue . and surprise was swallowed up by exasperation ; now , however , he quailed under her dark threats .
clarence began to explain his mission , while he was doing so the grand duke strolled to the basin and began to remove his make-up . he favoured , when on the stage , a touch of the raven gipsy no , three grease paint . it added a picturesque swarthiness to his appearance . and made him look more like what he felt to be the popular ideal of a russian general . [male] , watching him in the glass .
only one thing mars it : the tendency of one and all of the other six children to clamour for their turn with the book and the cane . the reason , i am sure , that journalism is so popular a calling . in spite of its many drawbacks , is this : each journalist feels he is the boy walking up and down with the cane . the government , the classes , and the masses . society , art , and literature .
`` things are not so jolly easy , '' said [male] , more to himself than to her . she kept her promise . and never opened her lips all the rest of the way . but her eyes glowed with anger and resolution . for she was a straight , brave woman , as well as a peevish one .
as for the orchestra , the vocal music especially , it is well for the performers that they can not be heard distinctly . vauxhall is a composition of baubles . overcharged with paltry ornaments , ill conceived . and poorly executed ; without any unity of design , or propriety of disposition . it is an unnatural assembly of objects .
they looked at one another and shook their heads a little , but zava turned to jeff and urged him to make [location] see . said he seemed to understand more fully than we did , and he tried . i can see it now , or at least much more of it . but it has taken me a long time . and a good deal of honest intellectual effort , they began with a really high degree of social development .
vulcan , fireman and tinsmith , made a number of celebrated forgings . had a career like the ancients and fell in love with [male] . wagner , [male] , a dutchman who wrote a few sheets of music . went into the opera business , but died before the good singers or [male] prices appeared . walker , [male] , 1820 , spent most of his life at your favorite bar until you appeared .
at first his new masters had been careful to keep him from all chance of escape . and [male] led him after the show by a string . but , as he seemed to be getting resigned to his position , allowed him to run loose . he was trotting tamely at jem 's heels one hot august morning . followed by a small train of admiring children , when all at once he became aware that he was in a street he knew well .
he opened a small black bag and produced a dark lantern . a coil of strong silk rope . and a small but serviceable jemmy , all that burglarious outfit belonged to my friend ! at this moment the pretty fair girl to whom he was engaged . vera vallance , arrived , but returned to [location] by the next train .
`` indeed , '' said miss [female] ; and then there was silence between them again . but , after a pause , miss mackenzie again took heart of grace . i do not think that there was , of nature , much of the coward about her . indeed , the very fact that she was there alone at littlebath . fighting her own battle with the world , instead of having allowed herself to be swallowed up by the [female] handcocks .
carriazo might be about thirteen or little more , when , prompted by a scampish disposition . without having had any cause to complain of bad treatment at home . he ran away from his father 's house . and cast himself upon the wide world , so much did he enjoy a life of unrestricted freedom . that amidst all the wants and discomforts attendant upon it , he never missed the plenty of his father 's house .
when [female] told me of this interview with the king i expressed great delight . with the other literary bohemians that now there sat on the throne of old albion . a patron of poetry , painting , music and sculpture . the church of rome and [organization] had been battling for nearly a hundred years in [location] for the mastery . and although the devotees of luther 's reformation had cracked the creed of popes and princes .
the judge laid himself out hospitality to make them have a good time . and if there was a defect anywhere , it was not his fault . he told them a good many humorous anecdotes . and always forgot the nub , but they were always able to furnish it . for these yarns were of a pretty early vintage , and they had had many a rejuvenating pull at them before .
the monkeys screamed and rushed in every direction , but the other soldier came behind the prince and knocked him down with the butt of his gun . then he tied his legs with another rope . and , seeing him thus bound , the crowd of monkeys . which had scattered and fallen over one another in their efforts to escape , came creeping timidly back . and looked on him with fear and trembling .
the girl friend , who for the first five minutes had remained entirely concealed beneath her hat . now sought diversion by looking up and examining the faces of the upper strata of passengers . her eye caught archie 's in a glance of recognition . and he smiled feebly , endeavouring to register bonhomie and good-will . he was surprised to see a startled expression come into her brown eyes .
i also engaged the services of a dark eyed historical student . who is said to know more about central park than any other man in [location] . having driven through it , as he has , for years . he was a plain , sad man . with a mustache which was mostly whiskers , he dressed carelessly in a neglige suit of neutral tinted clothes .
there is this advantage about german beer : it does not make a man drunk as the word drunk is understood in england . there is nothing objectionable about him ; he is simply tired . he does not want to talk ; he wants to be let alone , to go to sleep . it does not matter where -- anywhere , the conductor of the party stopped his cab at the nearest address . he took out his worst case ; it was a natural instinct to get rid of that first .
and if anybody can tell me what that means ( if it means anything . which i doubt ) i shall be grateful , as i said before , my brain is not working properly . there is no doubt that my temperament has changed , and in a very short space of time . a month ago i was soured , cynical , i did not brush my hair . and i slept too much , i talked a good deal about life .
but it was no use putting it off any longer . he resolved at last to go in and get it over , and opened the door accordingly . how warm and comfortable the room looked -- more comfortable than it had ever seemed to him before . even on the first day of the holidays , and his father would be sitting there in a quarter of an hour 's time . just as he was now , while he himself would be lumbering along to the station through the dismal raw fog !
it was a feat , there was no denying it . it was something attempted , something done . and by all the rules laid down by the poet it should . therefore , have earned a night 's repose , yet , sally , jolted by the train . which towards the small hours seemed to be trying out some new buck and wing steps of its own invention .
some men dry up with success , but it was just spouting out of hank . told me he would made his pile and that he was tired of living on the slag heap . that he would spent his whole life where money hardly whispered . let alone talked , and he was going now where it would shout , wanted to know what was the use of being a nob if a fellow was not the nobbiest sort of a nob . said he would bought a house on beacon hill .
as his eyes lit on him , [male] was conscious of a sudden solidifying of the vague suspicion which had been forming in his mind . and yet that suspicion seemed so wild , how could [male] , with the worst intentions . have had anything to do with this ? he could not forcibly have abducted the missing pair and kept them under lock and key . he could not have stunned them and left them in a ditch . nevertheless , looking at him standing there in his attitude of deferential dignity .
chapter i -- of those who lawfully may , and of those who may not . write such histories as this , chapter ii . containing a very surprizing adventure indeed , which mr [male] met with in his walk with the man of the hill . chapter iii -- the arrival of mr [male] with his lady at the inn . with a very full description of the battle of upton .
was the work of a moment , to drive to the office of mr. [male] was less . the portion of the novel which follows is perhaps the most notable part of it . it is this part of the chapter which the hibbert journal declares to be the best piece of psychological analysis that appears in any novel of the season . we reproduce it here , `` exactly , exactly , '' said [male] vere . writing rapidly in his note book as he sat in one of the deep leather armchairs of the luxurious office of mr. [male] .
4 , enter the bandilleros , carrying various ornate articles of girls clothing ( daisy hat with blue ribbons , pink sash . lace jabot , etc , ) which will , one by one , be hung on the bull when he is not looking . in order to accomplish this , one of the bandilleros will engage the animal in conversation while another sneaks up behind him with the frippery . when he is quite trimmed , the bandilleros will withdraw to behind a shelter and call him , [male] !
there was an old person of rheims , who was troubled with horrible dreams . so to keep him awake they fed him with cake . which amused that old person of rheims , there was an old man of leghorn . the smallest that ever was born ; but quickly snapt up he was once by a puppy . who devoured that old man of leghorn , there was an old man in a pew .
their new friend said no more just then , being busily employed in cutting a quid or plug from his cake of tobacco . and whistling softly to himself the while , when he had shaped it to his liking . he took out his old plug , and deposited the same on the back of the seat between mark and [male] . while he thrust the new one into the hollow of his cheek . where it looked like a large walnut , or tolerable pippin .
the swamps are full of razor backs like [female] . fellows who would rather make a million a night in their heads than five dollar a day in cash . i have always found it cheaper to lend a man of that build a little money than to hire him . as a matter of fact , i have never known a fellow who was smart enough to think for the house days and for himself nights . a man who tries that is usually a pretty poor thinker , and he is not much good to either .
mr. [male] then spoke about drinks . [male] protested that he never drank anything that would intoxicate . in fact , he was an uncompromising teetotaller . still , however , he had no objections to treating the crowd . as that would give him an opportunity to remain a few minutes more with the object of his admiration .
the room was empty , and as they had all conjectured by now , the bed was unslept in . they opened the drawers of the wardrobe and they were as empty as the room . finally , peppino unlocked the door of a large cupboard that stood in the corner . and with a clinking and crashing of glass there poured out a cataract of empty brandy bottles . emptiness : that was the key note of the whole scene .
lighting a match , he made his way through the silent store . through the stock room that had so lately been the foul lair of snake le vasquez . and into his own personal domain , a square partitioned off from the stockroom in which were his cot . the table at which he studied the art of screen acting . and his other little belongings , he often called this his den .
[female] and homer and pindar had all this grace . and pith and these sallies , -- and if i read [female] and homer and pindar . and if they only read mrs. [female] and mrs. [female] then where were they ? so continued lying brought its own reward in the sense of superiority and i lied more . when i reflect that i have openly expressed regret .
this was mrs. [female] 's story ; and she told it with such pathos . that all who heard it pitied her -- except her husband . it was now mr. [male] 's turn to speak . whilst his wife was speaking , he had stood with his back towards her . his arms folded across his breast to keep down his choler .
pretty generally , i agreed , but this we call revealed religion , and think it is final , but tell me more about these little temples of yours , ', i urged . `` and these temple mothers you run to , '' then she gave me an extended lesson in applied religion . which i will endeavor to concentrate , they developed their central theory of a loving power . and assumed that its relation to them was motherly -- that it desired their welfare and especially their development .
they were going to have tea at the biltmore when they got back to the city . i almost bit the end off of a sentry 's bayonet when i heard this woeful piece of news . liberty looks a long way off , i made an attempt to write some letters in the y.m.c.a . this evening but gave up before the combined assault of a phonograph . a piano , and a flanking detachment of checker players .
i will confess that with a good many women it is . `` you stick me and i will stick you . '' but that solidarity , primarily offensive and defensive , has also an element in it that women seldom understand . and almost always resent , not very many years ago a play ran in [location] without a woman in the cast or connected with the story . there is one running very successfully now in [location] , both were written by men , naturally .
baxter was now in a state of great excitement . he was hot on the scent and his brain was working like a buzz saw in an ice box . according to his reasoning , if aline peters maid had done this thing there should be red paint in the [female] marking her retreat . and possibly a faint stain on the stairs leading to the servants ', bedrooms . he hastened from the museum and subjected the [male] to a keen scrutiny , yes .
and really , considering his temperament and the peculiar nature of his position . it is not easy to see how he could have arrived at any other conclusion . [male] was feeling particularly happy as he walked back the next evening to vincent square . he had the consciousness of having done a good day 's work . for the sketch plans for mr. [male] 's mansion were actually completed and despatched to his business address .
you will hear venerable idealists declare we must make war on the ignorance of the poor . but , indeed , we have rather to make war on their knowledge . real educationists have to resist a kind of roaring cataract of culture . the truant is being taught all day , if the children do not look at the large letters in the spelling book . they need only walk outside and look at the large letters on the poster .
the speculation is not exempt from that drawback , if your father should stop . it will , of course , be necessary to wind him up , cas . but it 's so undignified -- it 's so degrading , a grandee of [location] turned into a public company ! such a thing was never heard of , duke , my child . the duke of plaza toro does not follow fashions .
they then bared one of his arms , tied round it a new silk ribbon through which they passed a short stick . and gave it two turns gently , after the manner of the garotte with which criminals are strangled . preciosa was present at all this , as were many other gitanas , old and young . some of whom gazed at [male] with admiration , others with love . and such was his good humour , that even the gitanos took most kindly to him .
blackie slid down in his chair and blew a column of smoke ceilingward . i knew a guy once -- newspaper man . too -- who retired with a fortune , he used to do the city [male] for us . well , he got in soft with the new administration before election . and made quite a pile in stocks that was tipped off to him by his political friends .
it seemed to relegate the war talk to the politicians on both sides of the water . whereas whenever a prospective war between two nations had been in the air theretofore . the public had done most of the talking and the bitterest , the attitude of the newspapers was new also . i speak of those of [location] and [location] . for i had access to those only , they treated the subject argumentatively and with dignity .
he opened his mouth and shut it again . and , with a sudden wincing of his features , abruptly turned and bent down to open the lantern in front of her machine . she looked down at him , almost kneeling in front of her . with an unreasonable approbation in her eyes , it was . as i have indicated , the hour and season of the full moon .
just then from out the casket leaped a tiny baby elephant . about as large as a mouse , and began capering about on its toes , it was dressed in short . fluffy skirts , like those worn by a ballet dancer , and it danced so funnily that all who saw it roared with laughter . when the elephant stopped to rest , two pretty green frogs sprang from the casket and began to play leapfrog before the astonished guests . who had never before seen such a thing as a frog , the little green strangers jumped over each other quick as a flash .
also to foxes , wolves , and bears . with which , and game in general , [location] abounds more than any other part of the world . and to such sports , manly exercises , and feats of gallantry and activity . as show the gentleman better than musty greek or latin . or all the perfume , finery , and capers of french wits or petit maîtres .
and then he set about telling me of the beautiful gold and silver ware they used in the elysian fields . and i must confess monte cristo would have had a hard time . with sindbad the sailor to help , to surpass the picture of royal magnificence the spectre drew . i stood inthralled until , even as he was talking , the clock struck three . when he rose up , and moving slowly across the floor , barely visible , murmured regretfully that he must be off .
and the head disappeared ; and shortly afterwards there came from across the passage muffled but cheerful sounds of splashing . the borough of [female] had been a little unfortunate -- or fortunate . according to the point of view -- in the matter of elections . the latter point of view was that of the younger and more irresponsible section of the community . which liked elections because they were exciting , the former was that of the tradespeople .
he admired pugilism , he carried a formidable oaken staff . he was a reverent churchman , and it was hard to know which would have more volcanically stirred his choler . a person who should have defended the established church , or one who should have neglected to attend its celebrations . he had besides some levelling catchwords . justly dreaded in the family circle ; and when he could not go so far as to declare a step un english .
`` the portmanteau , '' she said to herself ... no : she must take her mind off that subject . she would go for a walk , not into the high street . but into the quiet level country , away from the turmoil of passion and quarrels . where she could cool her curiosity and her soul with contemplation of the swallows and the white butterflies ( if they had not all been killed by the touch of frost last night ) . and the autumn tints of which there were none whatever in the treeless marsh ...
it had been mild autumnal weather in montreal . and the snow , which a week ago had fallen to the depth of two or three inches . had melted and been trodden out of sight save for the sprinkling which remained on the crest of mount royal . here , as a glance through the window disclosed , we were again in the land of snow . it was not deep , for winter had not yet set in , and the sleighs .
at this point the chronicle mercifully ceased , tobermory had caught a glimpse of the big yellow [male] from the rectory working his way through the shrubbery towards the stable wing . in a flash he had vanished through the open french window . with the disappearance of his too brilliant pupil [male] appin found himself beset by a hurricane of bitter upbraiding . anxious inquiry , and frightened entreaty , the responsibility for the situation lay with him . and he must prevent matters from becoming worse , could tobermory impart his dangerous gift to other cats ?
the girls who were on the ground , started first and managed to reach the schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare . the boys , who had to wriggle hastily down from the trees , were later . and [female] , who had not been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the grove . waist deep among the bracken , singing softly to herself , with a wreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity of the shadowy places . was latest of all , [female] could run like a deer , however ; run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys at the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as mr. [male] was in the act of hanging up his hat .
he would jolly well had enough of that little wretch to last his lifetime . thank you very much , [male] and bettine stepped solemnly hand in hand upon the little platform which had been provided for the may queen . [female] , who was chatting amicably to the parents till the last of her small performers should appear . seemed suddenly turned to stone , with mouth gaping and eyes wide . the old fiddler , who was rather short sighted , struck up the strains , and the dancers began to dance .
evidently she had not attracted him there , for she had been too indolent to sing of late . and he did not seem even to have seen her , or to have landed from any other motive than curiosity . he was quite young , gallant looking and sunburnt , with brown hair curling over his forehead . an open face and honest grey eyes , and as she looked at him . the fancy came to her that she would like to question him and hear his voice .
overcome with joy at finding she really cares for him . he comes down right and says that this is the happiest moment of his life . and she stands left , twelve feet away from him . and has the presentiment that all this sort of thing is much too good to last . they go off together , backwards , side by side .
the fourth and fifth holes call for no comment , they are without traps . the only danger being that you may lose a stroke through hitting the maid if she happens to be coming down the back stairs while you are taking a mashie shot . this is a penalty under the local rule , the sixth is the indispensable water hole . it is short , but tricky , teeing off from just outside the bathroom door . you have to loft the ball over the side of the bath .
she is one of the best hearted creatures i ever knew , and gains upon my affection every day . as for tabby , i have dropt such hints to the irish baronet . concerning her fortune , as , i make no doubt , will cool the ardour of his addresses . then her pride will take the alarm ; and the rancour of stale maidenhood being chafed . we shall hear nothing but slander and abuse of sir ulic mackilligut .
it was -- need we say it . [female] the governess , who was this day to enter upon her duties at nosham taws . at the same time that the dogcart entered the avenue at one end there might have been seen riding down it from the other a tall young man . whose long , aristocratic face proclaimed his birth and who was mounted upon a horse with a face even longer than his own . and who is this tall young man who draws nearer to [male] with every revolution of the horse ?
as to what their young friend would do with his money she could say nothing . she could not undertake the commission , -- though perhaps that might be best , -- and so on . her note to [female] was very short , she thanked him heartily for his good wishes . and told him the day on which she would be in [female] court . then in a postscript she said that she was `` very , very glad ''
once round the corner , he ran , it hurt his head to run . but there were things behind him that could hurt his head more than running . at the entrance to the tube he stopped . to leave the locality he must have money . he felt in his pockets , slowly , one by one , he pulled forth his little valuables .
there only remained now my serious verse , of which i turned out an enormous quantity . it won a ready acceptance in many quarters . notably the st , stephen 's gazette . already i was beginning to oust from their positions on that excellent journal the old crusted poetesses who had supplied it from its foundation with verse . the prices they paid on the st .
we may learn from this that mr. [male] was not a careful man in the matter of detail . his speech on the two hundredth anniversary of the landing of the pilgrims was a good thing . and found its way into the press of the time . his speech at the laying of the corner stone of the [male] hill monument . and his eulogy of [male] and [male] .
[male] could have tackled it nicely , [male] might have made a stab at it . dostoievsky would have handled it with relish , but for oneself the thing is too vast . one can not wangle it , it intimidates , it would have been bad enough in any case . for algy martyn was late as usual and it always gave [organization] the pip to have to wait for dinner . but what made it worse was the fact that the drones was not one of [organization] 's clubs and so .
the comet will leave [location] at 10 p.m. on the 20th inst. . and therefore it will be desirable that the passengers be on board by eight at the latest . to avoid confusion in getting under way , it is not known whether passports will be necessary or not . but it is deemed best that passengers provide them . and so guard against all contingencies , no dogs will be allowed on board .
ruth had been brought up in certain surroundings , her love for him . new and overwhelming , had enabled her to free herself temporarily from these surroundings and to become reconciled to a life for which . he told himself , she had never been intended . fate had thrown her back into her natural sphere . and now she revelled in the old environment as an exile revels in the life of the homeland from which he has been so long absent .
she dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg . and cry , and implore , in a passion of terror . but the master gave no attention , he snatched the child from her . and then made the men slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on the ground and hold her there and expose her body . and then he laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed .
if intelligent people decline to go , you justly remark , it is their own fault . yes , but if they stay away , it is very certainly their great gain . the elderly people are always neglected with us , and nothing surprises intelligent strangers more than the tyrannical supremacy of young [location] . but we are not surprised at this neglect , how can we be . if we have our eyes open ? when [female] pettitoes retreats from the floor to the sofa .
on the next morning lord [male] himself came down to brotherton . and [male] with a carriage full of precautions . was sent into the deanery to meet him , the marchioness discovered that the journey was to be made . and was full of misgivings and full of enquiries , in her present condition . the mother expectant ought not to be allowed to make any journey at all .
i ventured to say to a [location] man that i was a little surprised to find a little frog pond containing neither frogs or pond . but he said i would find it all right if i would call around during office hours . while sitting on one of the many seats which may be found on the common one morning . i formed the acquaintance of a pale young man . who asked me if i resided in [location] .
before he left [male] , d'artagnan had had made in that city a sort of coffin . large and deep enough for a man to turn in it at his ease . the bottom and sides , properly upholstered , formed a bed sufficiently soft to prevent the rolling of the ship turning this kind of cage into a rat trap . the little grating , of which d'artagnan had spoken to the king . like the visor of the helmet , was placed opposite to the man 's face .
and , being blind as he always has been , he gave the wrong things to the wrong people . in fact , he gave them just as indicated above . but the next day , in the course of christmas morning . the situation straightened itself out , just as it always does . indeed , by ten o'clock , [female] and [female] were playing with the train .
in all these things her husband was useless , quite useless , it is not right to be ashamed of one 's husband . and to do her justice , mrs. [organization] always explained to her three hundred intimates that she was not ashamed of him . in fact , that she refused to be , but it was hard to see him brought into comparison at their own table with superior men . put him , for instance , beside mr. [male] . the sex poet , and where was he ? nowhere , he could not even understand what mr. [male] was saying .
the cart jerked forward , and young [male] and his colleague grinned their valedictions . in their hearts the knowledge that they had just lived a crowded hour of glorious life . the cart jolted its uneasy way along the dusty high road . with bindle beside the driver , mrs. [female] on the blankets as grim as destiny itself . engaged in working up a case against bindle , and the boy scout watchful and silent .
the effect that [male] , the butler at the keiths ' . had on martin rossiter was to make him feel as if he had been caught laughing in a cathedral . he fought against the feeling , he asked himself who [male] was , anyway . and replied defiantly that [male] was a menial -- and an overfed menial , but all the while he knew that logic was useless . when the keiths had invited him to their country home he had been delighted .
at churchhill , however , i must remain till i have something better in view . my young lady accompanies me to town . where i shall deposit her under the care of miss summers . in wigmore street , till she becomes a little more reasonable , she will made good connections there . as the girls are all of the best families , the price is immense .
i always forgot to ask him how his guests fared . as it turned out , he had no chance of communicating with his servant before the dinner hour . the arrival of burnaby exceeded by one the stipulated number of passengers . and coxwell was anxious for [location] to start before any more got in . for a minute or two we still cling to the earth .
`` you look lovely this morning , '' [male] exclaimed . it was the first time he had ever had the courage to utter a personal remark of the kind . `` they are at the wash , '' [male] replied rather curtly . this white trouser business was all in the wrong spirit , he was just preparing a scheme to manoeuvre the conversation back to the proper path . when mr. [male] suddenly darted out of the house .
and the trivial matter of [female] , [male] was shelved . [male] , as he had stated in his letter to his mother . was exceedingly happy at eckleton , and getting on very nicely indeed , it is true that there had been one or two small unpleasantnesses at first . but those were over now , and he had settled down completely , the little troubles alluded to above had begun on his second day at blackburn 's . [male] , as the reader may have gathered from his glimpse of him at the station .
he never questioned the character or the intentions of the heroine . after all , he was only a dumb animal and his loyalty was tinged with no suspicions . deprived of the care of his owner , strongheart began to revert to type , he had been a wolf and he took to long hikes away from home . when he grew hungry he killed a cow . the cattle men put a price upon his head and strongheart became an outcast .
one corner of the room was fenced off with rough boards . forming a narrow closet , in which two people could , with some difficulty , sit down . this was the astrological chamber ; the mystic room into which visitors were conducted to have their fortunes told . madame lane is of the irish breed . is red haired , freckled , and dirty to a degree , her dress was ragged .
had the negroes risen in revolt ? had the aviators forced aside the iron bars of the grating ? or had the men of fish stumbled blindly through the hills and gazed with bleak . joyless eyes upon the gaudy valley ? [male] did not know , he heard a faint whir of air as the lift whizzed up again . and then , a moment later , as it descended , it was probable that percy was hurrying to his father 's assistance .
but i gather that kate dashaway was the kind of girl who might have made a fit mate even for the sort of intellectual giant that flourished at mr. [female] 's college . she was not only beautiful , all the girls remembered by mr. [female] were that . but she was in addition `` a good head '' and `` a good sport , '' two of the highest qualities that , in mr. [female] 's view . can crown the female sex , she had , he said .
he had arrived , breathless at sir [male] 's office . and the first thing he had seen was his daughter in the arms of a young man who was a total stranger to him . the shock took away his breath again just as it was coming back . he advanced shakily into the room , and supported himself with one hand on the desk . while with the other he plied the handkerchief on his super heated face .
the stage husband -- always the gentleman , bows . stiffly maybe , but quite politely ; and prepares in his turn to occupy the role of dumb but dignified defendant . to emphasise the coming change in their positions , the lady most probably crosses over to what has hitherto been his side of the stage . while he , starting at the same moment , and passing her about the centre . settles himself down in what must be regarded as the listener 's end of the room .
`` what a horrible looking scoundrel , '' exclaimed the uncrowned king in his most supercilious manner . and then began to talk of something else , he was a study as fascinating to the artist as to the politician . and no portrait ever drawn by pen or pencil can hand down to future generations the mysterious subtlety in the personality of the all powerful leader . he was as puzzling to the parliamentary artist as he was to the politician . he never appeared just as one expected him , when i first made a sketch of him he had short hair .
it was during the third year of the war that i received a peremptory summons from the head of the imperial secret service at [location] . baron fisch person . `` i want to see you , '' it read , nothing more . in the life of a spy one learns to think quickly , and to think is to act . i gathered as soon as i received the despatch that for some reason or other fisch person was anxious to see me .
but , as i say , everybody is in a hurry , husbands can t hardly find time to keep up a acquaintance with their wives , fathers [male] t have no time to get up a intimate acquaintance with their children . mothers are in such a hurry—babys are in such a hurry—that they can t scarcely find time to be born , and i declare for t , it seems sometimes as if folks [male]
besides the suspicion of sleep , the lieutenant harboured another and worse doubt against the poor centinel . and this was , that of treachery ; for as he believed not one syllable of the apparition . so he imagined the whole to be an invention formed only to impose upon him . and that the fellow had in reality been bribed by [organization] to let him escape . and this he imagined the rather , as the fright appeared to him the more unnatural in one who had the character of as brave and bold a man as any in the regiment .
if miss mackenzie could thereby have provided for all the negro soldiers orphans in existence . i do not think that she could at that moment have solicited him to make a purchase . `` how much does the paper knife cost ? '' said he , still smiling . it was a large , elaborate , and perhaps , i may say , unwieldy affair . with a great elephant at the end of it .
and it was at this point , when his resentment was at its height . that adair , the concrete representative of everything sedleighan . entered the room , there are moments in life 's placid course when there has got to be the biggest kind of row . this was one of them , psmith , who was leaning against the mantelpiece . reading the serial story in a daily paper which he had abstracted from the senior day room .
that last , in truth , was her valid excuse for not having told him the whole story . she had hardly been with him long enough to do more than accept the offer he had himself made . of course she would have told him of mr maguire . of mr maguire and of mr [male] also . when first an opportunity might come for her to do so , she had no desire to keep from his knowledge any tittle of what had occurred .
some persons were not quite fair in criticizing the shortcomings of president [female] at [location] . it was easy to seize upon `` open covenants '' and to demolish his sincerity by pointing out the secrecy with which negotiations were carried on . it is sentimentally satisfying to every liberal and radical in the world to declare that all the walls should have come down and to continue this criticism by suggesting that the arms conference ought to have been taken out of the pan [location] building and transferred to tex rickard 's arena on boyle 's thirty acres . or the yale bowl , the notion is fascinating because it permits the possibility of cheering sections and enables one to picture [male] cabot lodge leaping to his feet every now and again and asking all the men with the r. r. banners to join him in nine long rahs for the freedom of the seas . the delegates , of course , would be numbered so that the spectators could tell who was doing the kicking .
he looked at his watch again , and the world grew black . it was twelve minutes after ten . that it should make him feel a worm like humility had not entered his calculations . he was beginning to see something of the possibilities of love . his tentative excursions into the unknown emotion , while at college .
it is with a great , bounding joy that i impart the desired information . sevres is a small village just outside of st , cloud . it is given up to the manufacture of porcelain . you go to st , cloud by rail or river . and then drive over to sevres by diligence or voiture .
but still he was a sober soul , a labour never shirking man . who paid his way -- upon the whole a decent english working man . one day , when at the nelson 's head ( for which he may be blamed of you ) . a holy man appeared , and said , `` oh , [male] , i am ashamed of you . '' he laid his hand on [male] 's beer before he could drink up any .
there are three railway tracks ; the central one is cogged ; the `` lantern wheel '' of the engine grips its way along these cogs . and pulls the train up the hill or retards its motion on the down trip . about the same speed -- three miles an hour . is maintained both ways , whether going up or down , the locomotive is always at the lower end of the train .
looking into the matter , he found that they would have to be purchased outright . as the renting of five machines would put his credit to too severe a test . accordingly bertier telegraphed a wholesale order , which taxed the resources of the manufacturers and caused much complaint from some customers whose work was unaccountably delayed . the arrangement made by the courier was that they were to be taken back at a greatly reduced price at the end of six weeks . the machines were shipped at once , five to [location] , and one to the address of the mysterious marquise in [male] .
at that time i was serving on massena 's staff . and he had two other aides de camp , who were also very brave and intelligent officers . the name of one was cortex and of the other duplessis . they were senior to me in age . but junior in every other respect , cortex was a small , dark man .
some advocated wines , some ales , some a mixture of both with an occasional measure of spirits added for the sake of digestion . but among the dependable dietetic authorities of the present day there appears to be no wide range of argument on this point . they pretty generally agree that even a casual indulgence in beverages is not indicated for those who seek to reduce . i am sure they are right , but as i remarked just now , what can you do when you are encompassed about by the bottle toting . sop it up behind the door custom which has sprung up since prohibition was slipped over on [location] by the anti saloon league ?
mrs western was soon reconciled to her niece sophia . and [female] spent two months together with her in the country . lady [female] made the latter a formal visit at her return to town . where she behaved to [female] as a perfect stranger . and , with great civility , wished him joy on his marriage .
my trunk and trusty typewriter were sent on to my new home at noon . unchaperoned , for i had no time to spare at that hour of the day . later i followed them , laden with umbrella , boxes , brown paper parcels . and other unfashionable moving day paraphernalia , i bumped and banged my way up the two flights of stairs that led to my lake view and my bed . and my heart went down as my feet went up , by the time the cavernous bedroom was gained i felt decidedly quivery mouthed .
at least , that is what i did , b. is accustomed to german beds . and doubled himself up and went off to sleep without the slightest difficulty , we slept for two hours . and then got up and went back to the railway station , where we dined , the railway refreshment room in german towns appears to be as much patronised by the inhabitants of the town as by the travellers passing through . it is regarded as an ordinary restaurant , and used as such by the citizens . we found the dining room at cologne station crowded with cologneists .
it is strange to compare this sort of thing with some of the modern french pictures . there is realism enough and to spare in them , in the salon exhibition a year or two ago . for instance , there was one that represented lions turned loose into an arena to eat up christians . i can imagine exactly how a [female] quatorze artist would have dealt with the subject . an arena , prettily sanded , with here and there gooseberry bushes and wild gilly flowers .
this was a problem that wanted some solving , eventually they managed it . o'hara leaning over and fishing for it , while [male] held his legs . as luck would have it -- and luck had stood by them well all through . there was a bolt on top of the trap door , as well as beneath it . `` supposing that had been shot , '' said o'hara , as they fastened the door in its place .
he must have appointed the man who never kept his word . to meet him at another new place too ; for one day he was found . for the first time , by the waiter at the mourning coach horse . the house of call for undertakers , down in the city there . making figures with a pipe stem in the sawdust of a clean spittoon .
he and [male] never spoke to one another now except when it was absolutely unavoidable . and then they behaved with that painful politeness in which the public schoolman always wraps himself as in a garment when dealing with a friend with whom he has quarrelled . it was while matters were in this strained condition that fenn received a letter from his elder brother . this brother had been at eckleton in his time . school house -- and had left five years before to go to cambridge .
mr. [male] sat down , he put away his handkerchief . which had certainly earned a rest , then he fastened a baleful stare upon his newly discovered son . it was not the sort of look a proud and happy father in law to be ought to have directed at a prospective relative . it was not , as a matter of fact . the sort of look which anyone ought to have directed at anybody .
when [female] comes we shall be gone ; we shall be far away . i have said to [male] that i will fly with him . and he has said yes , i told him that we would go out into the world together . empty-handed we would fare forth together and defy the world , i said that he should be my knight errant , my paladin ! he has consented , but he says we must not fare forth empty-handed .
i could not indeed have received a more agreeable present , nor a more ominous one at the opening of that campaign . in which i made my apprenticeship as a soldier . a horse so gentle , so spirited , and so fierce -- at once a lamb and a bucephalus . put me always in mind of the soldier 's and the gentleman 's duty ! of young [male] , and of the astonishing things he performed in the field .
he brought in a cloud of witnesses . and produced an overwhelming mass of testimony , to show that old sledge was not a game of chance but a game of science . instead of being the simplest case in the world , it had somehow turned out to be an excessively knotty one . the judge scratched his head over it awhile . and said there was no way of coming to a determination , because just as many men could be brought into court who would testify on one side as could be found to testify on the other .
he had fought zulus , indians , tigers . elephants -- in fact , everything that fights . the baron had encountered , and in every contest he had come out victorious . he was the only man the children had ever seen that had lost three legs in battle and then had recovered them after the fight was over . he was the only visitor to their house that had been lost in the african jungle and wandered about for three months without food or shelter .
i love to believe that true greatness is not accidental , to think and to say that greatness is a lottery is pernicious . man may be wrong sometimes in his judgment of others . both individually and in the aggregate , but he who gets ready to be a great man will surely find the opportunity . many who read the above paragraph will wonder who i got to write it for me . but they will never find out , in conclusion , let me say that [male] was successful for three reasons .
story can not possibly get on without it , as you will see . you must have something of this sort in a romance . look at poe 's cypher in the gold beetle . and the chart in treasure island . and the portuguee 's scroll in king [male] 's mines. , ed .
the moslem veto upon intoxicants cuts across all classes . but it is absolutely necessary for the capitalist ( who presides at a licensing committee . and also at a large dinner ) , it is absolutely necessary for him . to make a distinction between gin and champagne . the atheist veto upon all miracles cuts across all classes .
on this long journey eastward travellers do not enter the city of [location] . they pass by on the other side of the river . and thus gain the advantage of seeing [location] as a picture should be seen . from a convenient distance , moreover , like many celebrated paintings , [location] will not stand inspection at the length of the nose . but even taken in detail , walking through its narrow and steep streets , there is much to delight the eye .
a cyclone , entering a room , is apt to alter the position of things . this cyclone shifted a footstool , a small chair . a rug , and spike , the chair . struck by a massive boot , whirled against the wall , the foot stool rolled away . the rug crumpled up and slid , spike , with a yell .
the duke admitted the validity of their excuses . but , availing himself of occasions warranted by custom and courtesy . he found means to load the two friends with rich gifts . which he sent from time to time to their house in bologna . many of these were of such value , that although they might have been refused for fear of seeming to receive a payment .
if one could imagine a smiling cat , madame [female] would resemble that cat more than any one thing in the world . neat and precise in her outward appearance . not a fold of her garments , not a thread of lace or ribbon . not a hair of her head , but was exactly smooth and orderly , and in its exact place . not a glance of her eye that was not watchful and suspicious ; not a tone or word that was not treacherous in sound .
the poor artist did move , and quickly too , but it was to the outside of the cabin ! the [male] was triumphant at table , telling [location] of his victory . but his poor opponent could only point to his untouched plate and to the waves dashing against the portholes . and with that shrug of the shoulders , so suggestive to witness but so difficult to describe . would thus in dumb show explain the cause of his defeat .
so they went off arm in arm , when [male] and mr chuzzlewit went off arm in arm a few minutes after them . the latter was still smiling ; and really , for a gentleman of his habits . in rather a knowing manner , brilliantly the temple fountain sparkled in the sun . and laughingly its liquid music played , and merrily the idle drops of water danced and danced . and peeping out in sport among the trees , plunged lightly down to hide themselves .
`` there you go -- into the box with you ! '' cried the farmer , as he dropped squinty into a wooden box the boy had made for his pet . with a hammer , saw and nails . squinty found himself dropped down on a bed of clean straw . in front of him , behind him .
for the process of making one another 's acquaintance had begun some ten minutes before with mutual recognitions between those who knew each other from having been together in previous productions . there followed rapid introductions of friends , nelly bryant had been welcomed warmly by a pretty girl with red hair . whom she introduced to jill as babe : babe had a willowy blonde friend . named lois : and the four of them had seated themselves on one of the benches and opened a conversation . their numbers being added to a moment later by a dark girl with a southern accent and another blonde .
from the dawn till the gloaming she used to sit combing her hair in a languorous way . and her suitors would stop to look into the shop , and stand there the rest of the day . she filled them with mute . but with deep despair , for she never glanced up , with a smile . to where they stood about , crushing each other , and blushing : she simply kept brushing her beautiful hair .
judge hawkins and wife were mark twain 's father and mother . [location] hawkins , his brother orion . their doings , with those of [male] as colonel sellers . were , of course , elaborated , but the story of the tennessee land . as told in that book , is very good history indeed , [female] hawkins .
i think we , we others . have a right to complain , however lucky we may be in other ways . if we have not this luck of inanimate things we have a right to complain . it is pleasant , i admit , to win £500 on the stock exchange by a stroke of sheer good fortune . but even in the blue of this there is a cloud , for the next £500 that we win by a stroke of shrewd business will certainly be put down to luck .
that night , as he turned into bed . he gave a comfortable sigh of content . i am glad she chose the dressmakers instead of the pictures , ', he said . mrs. [female] and [organization] arrived in [location] on wednesday . and expressed their anxiety to have carlton lunch with them .
these days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities . remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother . whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions . and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill humour at randalls . that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at hartfield .
when he got his lubberly sandals on , and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth . which hung straight from his neck to his ankle bones . he was no longer the comeliest man in his kingdom . but one of the unhandsomest and most commonplace and unattractive , we were dressed and barbered alike . and could pass for small farmers , or farm bailiffs .
while this was going forward in the rear , [male] and mr moddle walked on . arm in arm , in the front . in a state of profound silence . which [male] at last broke ; after thinking for a long time what he could say that should refer to an indifferent topic . in respect of which he might rely , with some degree of certainty .
she said it was a mean practice and was not clean . and i must try to not do it any more , that is just the way with some people . they get down on a thing when they do not know nothing about it . here she was a bothering about [female] , which was no kin to her . and no use to anybody , being gone , you see .
the caboclo slung the spade across his shoulder and walked slowly up the road that led to the plantation . through the wet hay which exhaled a piquant odor . some hens were clucking , hidden in the high grass , and a little ribbon of water which flowed gently along sparkled here and there through the openings in the brushwood . tiburcio , head bowed , spade on his shoulder . could not shake off the deep impression that had been made upon him by the sudden migration of the birds .
another interior was of the neat living room of the humble home . here were scenes of happy family life with the little sister and the fond old mother . the montague girl was a charming picture in her simple print dress and sunbonnet beneath which hung her braid of golden hair . the mother was a sweet old dear , dressed as baird had promised . she early confided to merton that she was glad her part was not to be a mopping part .
i was prepared to find half a dozen fierce spanish desperadoes within . but what actually met my eyes was even more embarrassing , the room had apparently been set aside for the use of some of the nuns . who for some reason had refused to quit their home , three of them were within . one an elderly , stern faced dame , who was evidently the mother superior , the others . young ladies of charming appearance , they were seated together at the far side of the room .
i wonder how old the town is , there are patches of building . massive structures , monuments , apparently -- that are so battered and worn , and seemingly so tired and so burdened with the weight of age . and so dulled and stupefied with trying to remember things they forgot before history began . that they give one the feeling that they must have been a part of original creation . this is indeed one of the oldest of the princedoms of [location] , and has always been celebrated for its barbaric pomps and splendors .
as will be remembered , the obstructionist nature of the irish soil prevented the city of [location] from proceeding farther inland than was necessary to keep her well balanced amidships upon a convenient and not too stony bed . and that after a brief sojourn on the rocks she was finally disposed of to the styx navigation company . under which title charon had had himself incorporated . is a matter of nautical history , the change of name to the [location] was the act of charon himself . and was prompted , no doubt , by a desire to soften the jealous prejudices of the residents of the stygian capital against the flourishing and ever growing metropolis of [location] .
`` i sometimes almost fancy that i wish the same thing , '' said he . with a faint attempt at a smile . and after that he got up and went his way , this was not to be endured . [female] declared to herself that she could not live and bear it . let the people around her say what they would , it could not be that he would treat her in this way if he intended to make her his wife .
we had mountains on the [location] shore and heavy timber on the [location] side . and the channel was down the [location] shore at that place . so we war not afraid of anybody running across us . we laid there all day , and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the [location] shore . and up bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle .
and then we had a game of lawn tennis . talbot and monk came through to make up sides . so much [female] told at once , but she did not tell more till she was alone with her mother . he ate his lunch before he said a word . and then , with but poor grace , submitted to the lawn tennis with talbot and monk .
frequently he could do both together , at the same moment there was slight scratching at the door . a visitor entered , he crawled stealthily on his hands and knees . a hearthrug thrown over his head and shoulders disguised his identity , so ! to clip the prince 's tail , the brain of the great detective reeled , so ! a gang of miscreants had conspired to—but no , the thing was not possible .
when it pleased rodaja to go forth into the city . the nobleman caused him to be attended by a servant . whose office it was to protect him from intrusion . and see that he was not molested by the boys of the place . by whom he was at once remarked ; indeed but few days had elapsed before he became known to the whole city .
a hurricane of laughter and applause went up from the crowd upon the bridge . the next moment both boats were bottom upwards and drifting sluggishly down towards the island . while the crews swam like rats for the other boats . every wrykinian had to learn to swim before he was allowed on the river . so that the peril of jackson and his crew was not extreme .
some evil genius put it into [male] 's mind that it was his duty to be . if only for one performance , the heavy elder brother to [male] . to give him good advice , it is never the smallest use for an elder brother to attempt to do anything for the good of a younger brother at school . for the latter rebels automatically against such interference in his concerns . but [male] did not know this , he only knew that he had received a letter from home .
i was held as in a vice , and could hardly move , by what . a huge dog -- a wolf ? no , something heavier . something more hideous ; something clothed , as i dragged it under a lamp i saw revealed a huge head . covered by a black skull cap -- a man 's head . a dwarf , muttering in irish something i could not understand .
i was glad i had sent that cable to his mother . i was going to need her , the thing had got beyond me . during the next week i saw a lot of old gussie . and was introduced to the girl , i also met her father . a formidable old boy with quick eyebrows and a sort of determined expression .
we have arranged it so that when you snore it will not disturb the night police . and if you do not like our children we will send them away . we realize that you do not like children very well . and our children especially gave you much pain . because they were not so refined as you were , we have often wished .
right here you will discover that you are in the fix of the young fellow who married his best girl and took her home to live with his mother . he found that the only way in which he could make one happy was by making the other mad . and that when he tried to make them both happy he only succeeded in making them both mad . naturally , in the end , his wife divorced him and his mother disinherited him . and left her money to an orphan asylum , because , as she sensibly observed in the codicil .
upon this she considered a little , but before the cloud was past by the moon . she gave him her consent . and he gave her his tobacco box for a pledge of marriage . and desired something of her in like manner for a pledge . but she said she had nothing .
the theatre was nearly full when [organization] 's party arrived . the leicester theatre had been rented for the season by the newest theatrical knight . sir [male] , who had a large following . and , whatever might be the fate of the play in the final issue . it would do at least one night 's business .
i have always regarded our dealings with nihilists . anarchists , or other secret associations for the perpetrating of murder as the most dangerous service a detective is called upon to perform . yet it is absolutely necessary that the authorities should know what is going on in these secret conclaves . there are three methods of getting this intelligence , first , periodical raids upon the suspected . accompanied by confiscation and search of all papers found .
long before he reappeared , attending the short , neat , brisk moving aunt , and her elegant niece . mrs. [female] , like a sweet tempered woman and a good wife . had examined the passage again , and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before . indeed very trifling ; and here ended the difficulties of decision , all the rest . in speculation at least , was perfectly smooth , all the minor arrangements of table and chair .
the legacy of the cardinal to the young king was composed of six words only . but those six words , as mazarin had said , were worth forty millions . [male] remained for an instant bewildered , as for mazarin . he appeared only to have said something quite natural , a little scratching was heard along the curtains of the alcove . mazarin understood : yes , yes , cried he , warmly , yes , sire .
in fact , much in these pages might well have been published under the title of `` confessions of endurance '' in sandow 's magazine or in the lancet . for the edification of those professional men who give advice to others not to overwork and invariably overwork themselves at the same time . travelling every day , giving `` the humours of parliament , '' with my imitations of ranting [male] -- nearly a two hours
all the seats is nailed to the table , when you get a spoonful of loose food up some fello puts his foot in your lap and leaves a couple of pounds of mud there . i just brush it off tho on the next fello , never complain . thats me all over , well mable i got to shine my shoes now and go and eat offen [location] plates with a nigger waiter . i dont eat with a nigger waiter , mable . its awful hard to explain things to you sometimes , so now i will close .
but as a mere voice in the political opera he had a charm above them all . in appearance he was commonplace compared with these others i have mentioned . often the most indifferent looking horse in the stable or in the paddock is the best in action . you would not give £40 for some standing at ease . but in action , moving to perfection , with fire and speed and staying power .
for , after its first appearance , it entered the room no more . he was never surprised , this man ; he never seemed to wonder at the extraordinary things he found in the box . but took them out with a face expressive of a steady purpose and impenetrable character . and put them on the table , he was a kind man . gentle in his manners , and much interested in what they ate and drank .
among these was my etruscan tear jug , i have made a little sketch of it here . that thing creeping up the side is not a bug . it is a hole , i bought this tear jug of a dealer in antiquities for four hundred and fifty dollar . it is very rare , the man said the etruscans used to keep tears or something in these things . and that it was very hard to get hold of a broken one , now . however .
one thinks of [location] as a woman , rather pretty , somewhat regardless of morals and decidedly slovenly of person . craving admiration , but too indolent to earn it by keeping herself presentable . covering up the dirt on a piquant face with rice powder . wearing paste jewels in her earlobes in an effort to distract criticism from the fact that the ears themselves stand in need of soap and water . [location] , viewed in retrospect , seems a great , clumsy , slow moving giant .
or for robbing birds nests , there would be two hands for use in skinning up the tree . and one hand for scaring off the mother bird and one hand for stealing the eggs . and for hanging on behind wagons the combination positively could not be beaten , then there would be the gaudy conspicuousness of going around with four arms weaving in and out in a kind of spidery effect while less favored boys were forced to content themselves with just an ordinary and insufficient pair . really , there was only one drawback to the contemplation of this scheme . there would be twice as many hands to wash when company was coming to dinner .
i then drew from my pocket a copy of the sunday world . which contained a voluptuous picture of myself , removing my hat and making a court salaam by letting out four additional joints in my lithe and versatile limbs . i asked if any further identification would be necessary , hastily closing the door to the vault and jerking the combination . he said that would be satisfactory , i was then permitted to deposit in the bank . i do not know why i should always be regarded with suspicion wherever i go .
she was carried away to her lodging , poor woman . and [organization] and i were alone -- alone , and thinking . brooding , dreaming , we might have been statues . we sat so motionless and still , it was a wild night . for winter was come again for a moment , after the habit of this region in the early spring .
so three weeks passed -- one week was left , it was saturday evening after supper . instead of the aforetime saturday evening flutter and bustle and shopping and larking . the streets were empty and desolate , [male] and his old wife sat apart in their little parlour . miserable and thinking , this was become their evening habit now : the life-long habit which had preceded it . of reading , knitting , and contented chat .
`` huh , '' she giggled wildly , `` scalp the selfish thing ! '' then picking up her staircase she set off at a half run down the moonlit street . the [location] station was hot and crowded , so [female] was forced to stand by the telegraph desk for interminable . sticky seconds while a clerk with big front teeth counted and recounted a large lady 's day message . to determine whether it contained the innocuous forty nine words or the fatal fifty one .
a man snatches the first kiss , pleads for the second . demands the third , takes the fourth , accepts the fifth -- and endures all the rest of them . after two years , an engagement does not need to be broken ; it just naturally sags in the middle and comes apart . eve had as much choice in the matter of a husband as any other woman . she merely accepted what fate sent her .
a note by the authors called attention to the fact that it could be begun from either end . the rest of the poems were mainly by belvane . merriwig 's share in them consisting of a `` capital , '' or an `` i like that , '' when they were read out to him . but an epic commonly attributed to [male] patacake had crept in somehow .
the sportsman may sport here with impunity , and the angler may also triangular relaxation . then the moonshiner does his distillery up in a napkin and goes away into the primeval forest . some years ago a party of revenue officers hunted out one of these amateur distillers and chased him up the side of the mountain . where they surrounded and captured him with his distillery on his back . like a babcock fire extinguisher , and still warm , the officer .
points of light twinkled in the [male] balls of the brass andirons . as soon as he entered , [male] felt the comely atmosphere of a charming and well ordered home . books lined the walls ; a french window opened on to the lawn at the far end of the room . a large bowl of blue hyacinths , growing in a bed of pebbles . stood on the reading table , mr. [male] was small .
in the parish church of crome mr. [male] preached on one kings vi . 18 : `` and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops '' a sermon of immediately local interest , for the past two years the problem of the war memorial had exercised the minds of all those in crome who had enough leisure . or mental energy , or party spirit to think of such things . [male] was all for a library -- a library of local literature .
for a good while i could not seem to get at a clear comprehension of it . it was so tangled , but at last by patient study i have managed it , i believe . as i understand it , the uitlanders and other dutchmen were dissatisfied because the english would not allow them to take any part in the government except to pay taxes . next , as i understand it , dr. [male] and dr. [male] . not having been able to make the medical business pay , made a raid into matabeleland with the intention of capturing the capital .
bishop remarked that he had no doubt she was telling a fib . and desired her to introduce him forthwith to her alleged mama , no . she could not do this , as she was just going out ; but if he would walk into the parlour . her mama would come to him presently , bishop was not to be had in this way . and so , taking the young lady by the hand , he led her into the parlour .
he him had accomplished in the art of to gobble the flies . and him there exercised continually -- so well that a fly at the most far that she appeared was a fly lost . [female] had custom to say that all which lacked to a frog it was the education . but with the education she could do nearly all -- and i him believe . tenez , i him have seen pose [male] there upon this plank .
to shew her taste in laying out ground , she seized into her own hand a farm of two hundred acres . about a mile from the house , which she parcelled out into walks and shrubberies . having a great bason in the middle , into which she poured a whole stream that turned two [male] . and afforded the best trout in the country , the bottom of the bason . however , was so ill secured , that it would not hold the water which strained through the earth .
our day 's run became the merest shadow of a formality . the office of head forester lapsed into an absolute sinecure . love was with us -- triumphant , and no longer to be skirted round by me . fresh , electric , glorious in person , we talked -- we must have talked , we moved . our limbs performed their ordinary , daily movements , but a golden haze hangs over that second period .
there were three great caravans or cars attached , the ladies car , the gentlemen 's car . and the car for negroes ; the latter painted black . as an appropriate compliment to its company , [organization] and mark tapley were in the first . as it was the most comfortable ; and , being far from full , received other gentlemen who .
does any elementary schoolmaster accord it even an instant 's consideration or respect ? i do not expect the schoolmaster to hate hospitals and c.o.s . centers so much as the schoolboy 's father . but does he hate them at all ? does he sympathize in the least with the poor man 's point of honor against official institutions ? is it not quite certain that the ordinary elementary schoolmaster will think it not merely natural but simply conscientious to eradicate all these rugged legends of a laborious people .
how changed he seems , once so gay and festive , now so still , so strangely quiet and reserved . how calmly he lies , with his bare limbs buried in the lurid atmosphere like those of a hippytehop artist on the west side . and what has the past year brought us ? speaking from a republican standpoint . it has brought [location] a large wad of dark blue gloom . speaking from a democratic standpoint , it has been very prolific of fourth class postoffices worth from dollar 200 down to dollar 1.35 per annum .
by long practice , the medium was enabled to determine what the investigator wrote . by the motion of his hand in writing . nine out of ten wrote the relationship first that corresponded with the first name they had written . therefore , if the medium selected the first that was written of each class , they in most cases referred to the same spirit . he waited till the investigator had affirmed the coincidence , before proceeding .
mazarin was in bed , suffering a little from the gout . but as he was a man of order . who utilized even pain , he forced his wakefulness to be the humble servant of his labor . he had consequently ordered bernouin , his valet [male] chambre . to bring him a little traveling desk , so that he might write in bed .
there was a scrambling of feet in the passage outside . and then a repetition of the onslaught on the door . this time , however , the door , instead of resisting , swung open . and the human battering ram staggered through into the study , [male] , turning after re locking the door . was just in time to see psmith , with a display of energy of which one would not have believed him capable .
he may wear what he likes in the future . for i shall never drive with him again , his conduct was shocking , when we passed highgate archway . he tried to pass everything and everybody . he shouted to respectable people who were walking quietly in the road to get out of the way . he flicked at the horse of an old man who was riding .
we could hear her pounding along , but we did not see her good till she was close . she aimed right for us , often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching . sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep , and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs . and thinks he 's mighty smart , well , here she comes . and we said she was going to try and shave us .
so far , my birthday had gone happily enough , in the evening , when i returned from the city . i sat down to write a short , sharp note to messrs. person and bast . i explained to them that by their impertinence they were running a grave risk of entirely losing my custom . and suggested to them that the lot of patterns to which they referred might very possibly have been lost in the post . when i had finished the letter , i wiped my pen on the inside of my coat .
wally was moving restlessly about the room , [organization] 's news had disquieted him . mr goble had a reputation , [organization] paused to allow him to proceed . if such should be his wish , but wally had apparently said his say , [organization] went on to point out an aspect of the matter which was troubling him greatly . wally started so violently that for a moment [organization] was uneasy , `` jill ! '' called wally once again , but again there was no answer , wally walked to the parapet .
at last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey green . greasy limpopo river , all set about with fever trees . to [male] new noses from the crocodile . when they came back nobody spanked anybody any more . and ever since that day , o best beloved , all the elephants you will ever see .
the lady in front of him said something about people `` reeking with tobacco smoke , '' and took another perfume shower bath , then the porter leaned over him to open the window . for the second time on this awful trip he was invited to `` change to the car ahead . '' the first thing he did was to hunt through his clothes for his ticket . no more of that upper number one business for your uncle martin , no sir !
monsieur d'artagnan traveled , then , pretty easily upon furet , who ambled like a true butter woman 's pad . and who , with his amble , managed cheerfully about twelve leagues a day . upon four spindle shanks , of which the practiced eye of d'artagnan had appreciated the strength and safety beneath the thick mass of hair which covered them . jogging along , the traveler took notes , studied the country . which he traversed reserved and silent , ever seeking the most plausible pretext for reaching belle ile en mer .
panic makes harlequin three quarters of [location] all , for one who had never played rugby football [male] handled the situation well . he drew the defence with a feint to the left . then , swerving to the right , shot past into the friendly darkness . from behind came the ringing of feet and an evergrowing din . his brain became preternaturally alert , so that when , rounding a corner , he perceived entering the main road from a side street in front of him a small knot of pedestrians .
[female] and the historians give an unpleasant impression regarding [female] 's personality . but this was done in the interests of the tudors , perhaps , he was highly intelligent . and if he had given less attention to usurpation . would have been more popular , under the administrations of the houses of lancaster and york serfdom was abolished . as the slaves who were armed during the war of the roses would not submit again to slavery after they had fought for their country .
`` i have not a thing to go in , '' said nellie , with a martyr 's sigh . he went to bed early , it seemed to him that his wife . his mother and the nurse were active and whispering up and down the house till the very middle of the night . he arose not late ; but they were all three afoot before him . active and whispering , he found out , on the morning after the highly complex transaction of getting his family from bursley to [location] .
we celebrated christmas by sleepin till a quarter to seven instead of hap past six . only they forgot to tell the fello what blows the horn an he blew it at hap past six anyway . imagine if anybody home had told me i could sleep till a quarter of seven christmas morning . i guess you know what id a told him . eh , mable ? theres a fello in town what says he will send flowers anywhere you want by telegraph .
others insist that he was a spanish jesuit named [male] . and others again intimate that his true title was the marquis [male] betmar . and that he was a native of portugal . the most plausible theory , however , makes him the natural son of an italian princess . and fixes his birth at [location] , in savoy .
[female] lived in a boarding house in guildford street . one day a new girl came to the boarding house . and sat next to [female] at meals , her name was [female] . she was small and quiet , and rather pretty , they got on splendidly , their conversation . at first confined to the weather and the moving pictures , rapidly became more intimate , [female] was surprised to find that she was on the stage .
he chose to do this by delivering a short homily on the advantages of school . by which he might lead [male] to look on the matter in the calm light of reason and common sense . and commonplaces on the subject began to rise to the surface of his mind . from the rather muddy depths to which they had long since sunk . he began to give [male] the benefit of all this stagnant wisdom .
it is possible , and even probable , that a man and his wife may disagree on politics as they might on religion . the husband may believe in [male] jackson and a relentless hell . while his wife may be a stalwart and rather liberal on the question of eternal punishment . if the husband manages his wife as he would a clothes wringer . and turns her through life by a crank , he will .
yet by these presents witness all she 's welcome fifty times . and comes consigned to hope and love and common meter rhymes , she has no manifest but this . no flag floats o'er the water , she 's too new for the british lloyds . my daughter , o my daughter , ring out , wild bells . and tame ones too , ring out the lover 's moon !
upon this incident , however , he had gradually embroidered the above exciting episode . until he grew to believe at intervals that he really had been a devil of a fellow in his time . which , to do him justice , was far from the case , he might have gone on still further to calumniate himself . and excite general envy and admiration thereby , if at that moment dr. grimstone had not happened to appear at the head of the cast-iron staircase that led down into the playground . whereupon mr. [male] affected to be intensely interested in the game , which , as a kind of involuntary compliment to the principal .
i have now reached the northern extremity of england . and see , close to my chamber window , the tweed gliding through the arches of that bridge which connects this suburb to the town of berwick . yorkshire you have seen , and therefore i shall say nothing of that opulent province . the city of durham appears like a confused heap of stones and brick . accumulated so as to cover a mountain , round which a river winds its brawling course .
oh , if his mother could have seen her son , for she loved him . her darling son ; if she could heard his dying prayer . it would ease her heart till she met him there . how it would relieve his mother 's heart to see her son from this world depart . and hear his noble words of love , as he left this world for that above .
the tone of the proceedings suited mr. [male] well . in his nervousness and abstraction he had backed up to the rusty . empty iron stove at the end of the room . and stood there , with spread coat tails , listening intently , on hearing the amount of bail . he gave a sigh of relief .
mr. [male] was a good deal distressed at lord [organization] 's refusal . and begged him to reconsider his decision , but the good natured peer was quite firm . and finally induced the minister to allow his daughter to retain the present the ghost had given her . and when , in the spring of 1890 , the young duchess of cheshire was presented at the queen 's first drawing room on the occasion of her marriage . her jewels were the universal theme of admiration .
there was an old person of pinner , as thin as a lath . if not thinner ; they dressed him in white , and roll would him up tight . that elastic old person of pinner , there was an old person of [location] . whose daughters were jiska and dinah . [male] and fluffy , [location] and chuffy .
and i would stop to see that glass dress all finished off for the princess eulaly . there it wuz in plain sight in mr. [male] 's factory draped on a wax figger of eulaly . mr. [female] made it and presented it to the princess . it took ten million feet of glass thread . it wuz wove into twelve yards of cloth .
presently ruby [female] started up to take a sum to the master . she fell back into her seat with a little shriek . believing that her hair was pulled out by the roots , everybody looked at her and mr. [male] glared so sternly that ruby began to cry . [male] had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the soberest face in the world . but when the commotion subsided he looked at [male] and winked with inexpressible drollery .
mrs. [organization] opened the case . which was much more modern than the kind of badge or pendant it contained . this was a fairly large oval stone of a milky green . deeply engraved with strangely formed letters interlaced in a cypher , and surrounded by a border of dark blue gems which mrs. [organization] decided instantly must be cabochon star sapphires of quite exceptional quality . the gold chain attached to it was antique and of fine and curious workmanship .
later in the morning the storm had gone down and the sea was calm as glass . and [male] and i got [male] up on deck . mr. [male] , the steward that i think i spoke about before . got [location] a steamer chair from the first class that had been thrown away . quite good except for one leg , -- and [male] sat in it with his face away from the sea .
) -- yes , and when i say that lord beaconsfield , whom i have no doubt you will see upon the sheet . ( wrap yourself up in yours . go home to bed , go home to bed ', ) . cries of this sort went on ; the gentleman struggled on for about a quarter of an hour and then sat down . well , i discovered afterwards that he was a very ardent politician .
its so slow it cant stop quick , i got the blacksmith over at headquarters company workin on it now . hes an awful good man , he was a plumber in civilian life . thats why they made him a blacksmith when he joined the army . he says hes goin to fix it sos ill never be bothered with it again . i made good , mable , i guess you [female] i would .
when he was five he was sent to kindergarten , where he initiated into the art of pasting green paper on orange paper . of weaving coloured maps and manufacturing eternal cardboard necklaces . he was inclined to drowse off to sleep in the middle of these tasks . a habit which both irritated and frightened his young teacher , to his relief she complained to his parents . and he was removed from the school , the [male] buttons told their friends that they felt he was too young .
a known punishment may be anticipated with some measure of equanimity . at least , the prisoner may prepare himself to undergo it . but the unknown looms more monstrous for every attempt to guess it . penrod 's crime was unique ; there were no rules to aid him in estimating the vengeance to fall upon him for it . what seemed most probable was that he would be expelled from the schools in the presence of his family .
lieut , i see , i think that manner of thing would be somewhat irritating . point at first , sir , perhaps ; but use is everything . and you would come in time to like it , [male] . we will suppose that i caught you kissing the kitchen wench under my very nose . point under her very nose , good sir -- not under yours !
he said he wanted to go through the harem . they finally entered into the rear apartment , here their wondering eyes beheld a long room . well lighted with gas , in the centre was a small basin . in which goldfish were indulging in their accustomed aquatic sports , on either side were arranged wide divans . covered with red drapery and high pillows , small stands were arranged in front of them .
the psychology of a man of weak character under the influence of alcohol and disappointed ambition is not easy to plumb . for his moods follow one another with a rapidity which baffles the observer . ten minutes before , gerald foster had been in the grip of a clammy self pity . and it seemed from his aspect at the present moment that this phase had returned . but in the interval there had manifestly occurred a brief but adequate spasm of what would appear to have been an almost berserk fury .
the satisfaction in flattering a man consists in the fact that . whether you lay it on thick or thin . rough or smooth , a little of it is always bound to stick , love is a furnace in which the man builds the fire . and forever afterward expects the woman to keep it glowing , by supplying all the fuel . a man may have heart enough to love more than one woman at a time .
whatever the electrical or spirit hand touches , will inevitably be transferred to the hand of the medium in every instance . unless something occurs to prevent the full operation of the law by which this result is produced . the spirit hand being composed in part of the magnetic elements drawn from the medium . when it is dissolved again , and the magnetic fluid returns whence it came . it must of necessity carry with it whatever material substance it has touched .
the only thing more astonishing than the length of time a man 's love will subsist on nothing is the celerity with which it is surfeited the moment it has any encouragement to feed on . even when a man knows that he wants to marry a woman . she has to prove it to him with a diagram before he is really convinced of it . a man is so apt to mistake his love of experiment for love of a woman that half the time he does not know which is which . a man is so versatile that he can read his newspaper with one set of brain cells while he carries on a conversation with his wife with another set .
not until long afterward , on a certain dread night when the earth was to rock beneath him . did he recall that baird had never retaken that window scene . at present the young actor was too engrossed by the details of his daring leap to remember small things . the leap was achieved at last , he was in the saddle after a twenty foot drop . he gathered up the reins , the horse beneath him coughed plaintively .
and scarcely hath the good woman gotten these two main instruments ; but she finds her self still involved in so much other business . that she hardly can tell how to do or turn her self in it . for now there wants a groaning stool , a screen . and a cradle , with what belongs to it ; and heaven knows what more . which have been so long neglected with the care that was taking to get a midwife and a nurse .
after this there was another hymn , sung even with increased volume of sound . energy was the predominant characteristic of the whole service . and it reached its height in the singing of hymns . when the congregation found the opportunity of joining their leaders in the devotional utterance . there were half a dozen women in the congregation who had solved the home difficulty about the baby by bringing it with them to chapel .
the next morning , old man marshall woke with a lightness at his heart that had been long absent . for a moment , conscious only that he was happy , he lay between sleep and waking . frowning up at his canopy of mosquito net , trying to realize what change had come to him . then he remembered , his old friend had returned , new friends had come into his life and welcomed him kindly . he was no longer lonely , as eager as a boy , he ran to the window .
but it was at this very moment that the armistice burst upon [location] in a perfectly unexpected fashion . everyone of our members was , undoubtedly , delighted that the war was over but there was a very general feeling that it would have been better if we could have had a rather longer notice of what was coming . it seemed , as many of our members said , such a leap in the dark to rush into peace all at once . it was said indeed by our best business men that in financial circles they had been fully aware that there was a danger of peace for some time and had taken steps to discount the peace risk . but for the club itself the thing came with a perfect crash .
anyway , this supper scene has to come in , it is symbolical , you can not really show amalfi and fiesole and the orange trees . so this kind of supper takes their place . as the maid moves about there is a loud knock at the cardboard door of the apartment . a man in official clothes sticks his head in . he is evidently a postal special messenger because he is all in postal attire with a postal glazed hat .
the net does not appear until the 17th century , up until that time a rope . either fringed or tasseled , was stretched across the court , this probably had to be abandoned because it was so easy to crawl under it and chase your opponent . there might also have been ample opportunity for the person playing at the net or at the `` rope , '' to catch the eye of the player directly opposite by waving his racquet high in the air and then to kick him under the rope . knocking him for a loop while the ball was being put into play in his territory .
no one else of the world full of men and wimmen to believe as he did . no one else to be even willin to hear him talk about his dreams . his hopes , and impassioned beliefs , no ; and i do not know but [location] would have dropped right down in his tracts . and we would not have been discovered to this day , if a woman had not stepped in . and gin the seal of her earnest trust to the ideal of the ambitious man .
i explained that [female] would not come upstairs again , so i was permitted to depart after securing the window . again i settled myself with book and cigar . there was at least for me the extra enjoyment that comes from the sense of pleasure earned by honest toil . pretty soon budge entered the room , i affected not to notice him . but he was not in the least abashed by my neglect , `` uncle [male] , ''
if any parisian anarchist does me the honour to read these jottings . i beg to inform him that while i remained in office under the government of [male] there was never a time when i did not know the exit of each of these underground passages . and could during any night there was conference have bagged the whole lot of those there assembled . it was never my purpose , however , to shake the anarchists confidence in their system , for that merely meant the removal of the gathering to another spot .
van dyke , beard inventor and artist . a dutchman who invaded england with portraits and his tonsorial achievement , van houten . he was the man who put cocoa in tin boxes . [female] , a dream of a girl who lived long ago . posed for her statue , and had to die after everybody fell in love with her .
`` i do not mind tellin '' you , [female] . that that was a darn good story you got on the millhaupt divorce . the other fellows have not a word that is not re hash , all of which is most unwomanly . for is not marriage woman 's highest aim , and home her true sphere ? have not i tried both ? i ought to know , i merely have been miscast in this life 's drama .
but in those three minutes the thing happened , for the first time in the match the [female] forwards heeled absolutely cleanly . hitherto , the ball had always remained long enough in the scrum to give [location] and wogan . the school halves , time to get round and on to their men before they could become dangerous . but this time the ball was in and out again in a moment . the [male] half who was taking the scrum picked it up .
the small shrill sounds which came through the crash of the conflagration were indeed of an odd sort . and [male] turned a face of puzzled inquiry to his companion . `` he is singing , '' said [male] , simply , a remaining rampart fell . crushing the fire , and through the diminished din of it the voice of the little old lunatic came clearer . in the heart of that white hot hell he was singing like a bird .
so then the poppits were giving a bridge party to which she had only been bidden at the last moment . clearly to take the place of some expected friend who had developed influenza . lost an aunt or been obliged to go to [location] : here , too , was the explanation of why major [female] and [female] were only intending to play one round of golf today . and to come back by the 2.20 train , and why seek any further for the explanation of the lump of ice and the red currants which she had observed [female] purchase ? and anyone could see why she had gone to the stationer 's in the high street just before .
be good enough to send me , by return , at least £100 . it 's a very difficult and expensive thing to support the dignity of your paper in this town . whiskey is very dear , and a great deal goes a very short way . the lilies are languid , the aspens quiver , the sun god shooteth his shafts of light . the ripples are wroth with the restless river ; and o for the wash of the weir at night !
with the last word of the joke the dragon drew back his head and struck . in that second there flashed into the mind of gawaine the magic word `` rumplesnitz , '' but there was no time to say it , there was time only to strike and . without a word , gawaine met the onrush of the dragon with a full swing . he put all his back and shoulders into it .
as they raced across the soft turf , an idea occurred to [male] . which he was accustomed in after years to attribute to genius , the one flash of it which had ever illumined his life . one of mr , [male] 's first acts . on starting the fire brigade at sedleigh , had been to institute an alarm bell . it had been rubbed into the school officially -- in speeches from the dais .
forces had been set in motion that put the seventeen owners between the devil and the deep sea . and [male] 's part was simply to `` handle '' the matter from a little village near pueblo . with tact and efficiency the right man could bring it off without any friction . for it was merely a question of sitting at the wheel and keeping a firm hold . [male] , with an astuteness many times valuable to his chief .
at this point [female] threw away the sculls . got up and left his seat , and sat on his back , and stuck his legs in the air . montmorency howled , and turned a somersault , and the top hamper jumped up . and all the things came out , but , there , i [male] t suppose i should really care for it when it came to actual practice .
it was broad , bright , stirring day when , leaving the old clerk to watch him . they went down to breakfast , people hurried up and down the street . windows and doors were opened ; thieves and beggars took their usual posts . workmen bestirred themselves ; tradesmen set forth their shops . bailiffs and constables were on the watch .
i do not care if she 's got it . i want to pay it , i suppose it 's a silly thing to get sore about . but it sort of annoys me . anyway , how do you maneuver around to do something for a girl when she does not even know you want to ? the man in the deli gives [location] directions to get to the zoo .
and so it came about that [female] soared once again into the ranks of the elect . and found his name down in the team to play against the incogniti . wrykyn went down badly before the incogs , it generally happens at least once in a school cricket season that the team collapses hopelessly . for no apparent reason , some schools do it in nearly every match . but wrykyn so far had been particularly fortunate this year , they had only been beaten once .
but we see the bravest sparks , in the very blossoming of their youth . how they decay ? first , gentleman like , they take pleasure in all manner of noble exercises . as in keeping time all dancing , singing of musick . playing upon instruments , speaking of several languages . studying at the best universities , and conversing with the learnedst doctors .
anyone who chooses to walk into a large church on sunday morning may see a hundred men each alone with his maker . he stands , in truth , in the presence of one of the strangest spectacles in the world . a mob of hermits , and in thus definitely espousing publicity by making public the most internal mystery . christianity acts in accordance with its earliest origins and its terrible beginning . it was surely by no accident that the spectacle which darkened the sun at noonday was set upon a hill .
on the day of your departure you send for your hotel bill . you do not go to the desk and settle up there after the [location] fashion . if you have learned the ropes you order your room waiter to fetch your bill to you . and in the privacy of your apartment you pore over the formidable document wherein every small charge is fully specified . the whole concluding with an impressive array of items regarding which you have no prior recollection whatsoever .
but they were wrong , what had brought dexter to the vault was the fact that he had seen two boys . who looked uncommonly like o'hara and [male] , go down the steps of the vault at a quarter to six . he had been doing his usual after lock up prowl on the junior gravel . to intercept stragglers , and he had been a witness . from a distance of fifty yards , in a very bad light .
after fighting my way through this edifice i was taken in hand by a juvenile guide . who discoursed in the orthodox fashion of his kind about the whirlpool rapid . pointed out where plucky , foolish [male] webb met his death . crushed by the force of water , and , lower down , the spot where his body was found . then my young chaperon unburdened himself of a string of horrors concerning men in barrels .
this was alarming , half a dozen of their number set out , then early in the afternoon . to seek and succor sir [male] and his guides . the persons remaining at the cabin saw these disappear , and then ensued another distressing wait . four hours passed , without tidings , then at five o'clock another relief . consisting of three guides , set forward from the cabin , they carried food and cordials for the refreshment of their predecessors .
it was nearly half past ten that night when bindle tip toed up the tiled path leading to the front door of no . seven fenton street , softly he inserted his key in the lock and turned it . but the door refused to give , he stepped back to gaze up at the bedroom window . there was no sign of a light , it suddenly struck him that the piece of paper on the door was not the same in shape as that he had seen at dinner time . it was too dark to see if there was anything written on it .
after all , he had not been to blame ; the wackerbaths were quite satisfied . he felt perfectly sure that he could justify their selection of him . he would wrong nobody by accepting the commission . while he would only offend them , injure himself irretrievably . and lose all hope of gaining [male] if he made any attempt to undeceive them .
we have got an old steer out at the packing house that stands around at the foot of the runway leading up to the killing pens . looking for all the world like one of the village fathers sitting on the cracker box before the grocery . sort of sad eyed , dreamy old cuss -- always has two or three straws from his cud sticking out of the corner of his mouth . you never saw a steer that looked as if he took less interest in things . but by and by the boys drive a bunch of steers toward him .
but on nearing it , he saw them hoist a black flag . and presently he heard a mournful sound of trumpets . indicating that either the general or one of his chief officers was dead , when he came within hail . which had not before been the case since they put to sea . there was a call from the leading ship for [male] to come on board .
it was a fine breezy morning as the colonel set out with billy traynor for belmullet . the bridle path by which they travelled led through a wild and thinly inhabited tract . now dipping down between [location] , now tracing its course along the cliffs over the sea . tall ferns covered the slopes , protected from the west winds . and here and there little copses of stunted oak showed the traces of what once had been forest .
of course i put much of this down to the score of illness . and of bad health before he was so ill ; but , depend upon it . he 's not the man we knew him . heaven knows if he ever will be so again , the night i arrived here he was more natural . more like himself , in fact , than he has ever been since .
for an instant sam stood there , gaping blankly , then the open door of the saloon seemed to beckon an invitation . he made for it , reached it . passed through it , that concluded his efforts in aid of the seamen 's orphans and widows . the spell which had lain on the audience broke . this imitation seemed to them to possess in an extraordinary measure the one quality which renders amateur imitations tolerable .
how they rode , how their hearts beat together and their breath came fast . and how every shadow was anticipation and every noise pursuit ! for all that flight mr. [male] was in the world of romance . had a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit , [male] had cut him down and ridden on . after the fashion of a hero born .
i sent him back immediately to know what strangers were in the house . and he returned with a report that there was one mr [male] lately arrived . in consequence of this information i charged him with a note directed to that gentleman . desiring him to meet me in half an hour in a certain field at the town 's end . with a case of pistols , in order to decide the difference which could not be determined at our last rencounter .
the schoolmaster and his consort passed their time unpleasantly enough that evening . but something or other happened before the next morning , which a little abated the fury of mrs partridge . and she at length admitted her husband to make his excuses . to which she gave the readier belief . as he had , instead of desiring her to recall [female] , professed a satisfaction in her being dismissed .
during her childhood , [female] lived in different parts of castile . but in her sixteenth year her grandmother brought her to [location] . to the usual camping ground of the gipsies , in the fields of [female] . [location] seemed to her the most likely place to find customers . for there everything is bought and sold , [female] made her first appearance in the capital on the festival of [female] .
when `` uncle [male] 's cabin '' was written things came to such a pass that a bloodhound could not see a cake of ice without jumping on it and beginning to bay . watch an excited [location] today and you will find his gestures as sweeping as those of any frenchman . as soon as he is jarred in the slightest degree out of calm he immediately begins to follow subconscious promptings and behave like his favorite motion picture actor . nor does the resemblance end necessarily with mere externals . [male] , the senator from [location] .
again the bell rang , and still did it remain unanswered . until finally , at the third ringing , i went to the door myself . on opening it i saw standing before me a man of . i should say , fifty odd years of age . tall , slender , pale faced , and clad in sombre black .
what then was the correctly diabolical policy to pursue ? should [male] quantock refuse to take him to mrs lucas altogether . with a message of regret that he did not feel himself sent ? even if she did this , did she feel herself strong enough to throw down the gauntlet and . using him as the attraction , challenge darling [female] to mutual combat . in order to decide who should be the leader of all that was advanced and cultured in riseholme society ?
he had barely leaped into the [male] 's cutter before a breathless beast slid down from the heights of the square and galloped towards him . it was the faithful camel , who had been hunting after his master in algiers during the last four and twenty hours . on seeing him , [male] changed countenance . and feigned not to know him , but the camel was not going to be put off . he scampered along the quay ; he whinnied for his friend .
he set off down the road , his hands in his pockets and his brows drawn into a stern frown . he amused himself by imagining uncle [male] in various predicaments . lost on a desert island , captured by pirates . or carried off by an eagle , then something in the window of a house he passed caught his eye and he stopped suddenly . it was a stuffed bird under a glass case .
your protege , [female] , goes on famously , he 's a broth of a boy . not a pickle , like many lads of his age . and yet he wo not stand being sauced , as he calls it . he and i nearly got parted at the station , for the crowd was very great after the races . in fact , a regular jam , it rained hard when we reached sandwich .
he met the lobs with a bat like a barn door . even the departure of morris , caught in the slips off saunders 's next over for a chanceless hundred and five . did not disturb him , all nervousness had left him . he felt equal to the situation , burgess came in . and began to hit out as if he meant to knock off the runs , the bowling became a shade loose .
whether the public would not be well advised to look a little closer into it before investing their money ? if it is not a fact that this gentleman has bought a first class ticket to the argentine in case of accidents ? whether he may not have to use it at any moment ? after that it was easy , ideas came with a rush . by the end of an hour he had completed a scandal page of which mr. [male] himself might have been proud .
here lies [male] , attorney at law , when he died the devil cried . give me your paw , [male] , attorney at law . here lies my wife a sad slatterned shrew if i said i regretted her i should lie too . here lies [female] , she lived an old maid but died an old mann . here lies ned hyde because he died , if it had been his sister we should not have missed her .
these free and easy looking damsels did not seem to find favour in the eyes of certain other ladies of a sedater type . who regarded them with undisguised contempt , these other ladies . i should think , from their conversation and appearance . must have been the very flowers of the flock of brixton rise . and the creme person la creme of peckham rye society .
there was a young person in red , who carefully covered her head . with a bonnet of leather , and three lines of feather . besides some long ribands of red , there was an old person of hove . who frequented the depths of a grove ; where he studied his books . with the wrens and the rooks , that tranquil old person of hove .
it was the climax of the battle . the last rally , down went [male] , and stayed down , physically , he was not finished . but in his mind a question had framed itself , the question . was it worth it ? ' -- and he was answering , no . there were other girls in the world , no girl was worth all this trouble .
he twiddled again , the ring and the bracelet had fetched nearly twelve hundred dollar . up to that figure his hat was in the ring . a voice spoke from somewhere at the back of the room . a quiet , cold , nasty , determined voice , archie rose from his seat and spun round . this mean attack from the rear stung his fighting spirit .
the hotel 's named after the fella that built it . he come from [location] and they say he was huntin for some water that if he would drunk it he would feel young . i do not see myself how you could expect to feel young on water . but , anyway , he would heard that this here kind o
most of you , no doubt , have heard about it . on those who may not have heard it , the announcement will fall with a sickening [location] . this sketch is not intended to cast a gloom over your hearts . it was designed to cheer those who read it and make them glad they could read . therefore , i would have been glad if i could have spared them the pain which this sudden breaking of the news of the death of demosthenes will bring .
what he saw was a small oblong room in which there was no window . and , at first glance , no means of entrance or exit . it was high ceiled like the room in which he stood . and , with the exception of a narrow couch covered with a black velvet robe . with a small pillow of the same material at the far end .
i gave him minute directions as to where he could go . but instead we drove in black silence to the station . there edgar rewarded rupert with a dime , and while we waited for the train to [location] placed the two suit cases against the wall of the ticket office and sat upon them . when the train arrived he warned me in a hoarse whisper that i had promised to help him guard the treasure . and gave me one of the suit cases , it weighed a ton .
upon my word , said mistris bounce about , it is an excellent help when men understand their travelling upon such sort of roads . it hapned to me once that some gentlewomen were merry with me somewhat late in the evening . and because i had had several symptoms of labour . said this , mistris bounce about , if you would now take a walk to the parsley bed . we would help you very bravely ; but neither wind nor weather was serviceable at that time .
the landlord of the `` crow , '' who is a hospitable man . finding that my trunk contained sufficient to indemnify him for any little trouble he might take in my behalf . sent forthwith for a surgeon of his acquaintance . and delivered me to his care with a bill and receipt for ten dollar . the purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations immediately .
'men must work , and women must weep , as shakspeare says , he observed , with a vague idea that he was making rather an apt quotation . but his companion pointed out that this only applied to cases where the women had something to weep about . the party had a compartment to themselves . and leander , who sat at one end opposite to ada .
the world would be as dull as an oyster bed , without you wicked folk there would be no good . how should we have known and honoured the heroine 's worth . but by contrast with your worthlessness ? where would have been her fine speeches . but for you to listen to them ? where lay the hero 's strength . but in resisting temptation of you ? had not you and the wicked baronet between you robbed him of his estates .
[female] , too , would be weak this year , now that he was no longer there . strachan was a good , free bat on his day . and , if he survived a few overs , might make a century in an hour . but he was not to be depended upon , there was no doubt that [male] 's sudden withdrawal meant that [male] would have a bad time that season . and it had been such a wretched athletic year for the school .
and the same dust has sprinkled down onto the happy heads of the fresh , bright faced little group gathered there . [female] , and alice , oh , the dust is very deep on her head . the dust that shall at last lay over all our heads , and [female] ! bright blue eyes there may be today , old time . but none truer and tenderer than his .
these two alone would pile up fifteen points , three points were given for a win . two for second place , and one for third , it was this that encouraged person in the hope that person 's might have a chance . nobody in the house could beat milligan or maybury . but [organization] second and third strings were not so invincible , if person 's . by means of second and third places in the long races and the other events which were certainties for their opponents .
an answering groan came from the foot of the bed ! beaded drops of sweat stood upon my forehead . i was more dead than alive , presently i heard a heavy footstep in my room . the step of an elephant , it seemed to me . it was not like anything human , but it was moving from me .
they held a council standing before the river gate . short time was there , ye well may guess , for musing or debate , out spoke the consul roundly . `` the bridge must straight go down ; for , since janiculum is lost , naught else can save the town . '' and nearer , fast , and nearer doth the red whirlwind come ; and louder still . and still more loud , from underneath that rolling cloud , is heard the trumpet 's war note proud .
what if they are not aunts , but merely neighbors ? or perhaps an association of former cooks , parlor maids , nurse girls , or strangers ? the sufferings of the usher are relieved by the battleship . who halts majestically about twenty feet from the altar , and motions her followers into a pew to the left . they file in silently and she seats herself next the aisle .
it began to be clear to bill that any move he took . except full confession , at which he jibbed -- was going to involve [male] nichols as an ally . and this discovery had a soothing effect on him . it made him feel that the responsibility had been shifted . he could not do anything till he had consulted [male] .
it is remarkable that as there was , in the oldest family of which we have any record . a murderer and a vagabond , so we never fail to meet . in the records of all old families , with innumerable repetitions of the same phase of character . indeed , it may be laid down as a general principle , that the more extended the ancestry . the greater the amount of violence and vagabondism .
for the next three seconds you could have heard a cannonball drop . and that was equivalent , in the senior day room at seymour 's , to a dead silence . [male] stood in the middle of the room leaning on the stick on which he supported life . now that his ankle had been injured , and turned red and white in regular rotation . as the magnificence of the news came home to him .
the white man 's spirit was right , but his method was wrong . his spirit was the spirit which the civilized white has always exhibited toward the savage . but the use of poison was a departure from custom . true , it was merely a technical departure , not a real one ; still , it was a departure . and therefore a mistake , in my opinion , it was better .
[organization] has grown to be much interested in what is called here `` advertising , '' -- a thing that he says all kings ought to study . and he decided , after he had got over his first indignation . that cousin [male] being in sing sing would be a very good advertisement for him . it might bring him , he said . quite a lot of new business ; especially if it was known that he refused to help cousin [male] in any way or to have anything more to do with any of the rest of us .
as , however , the day broke more distinctly in our approach to the outskirts of the city . my tormentor , arising and adjusting his shirt collar , thanked me in a very friendly manner for my civility . seeing that i remained motionless ( all my limbs were dislocated and my head twisted on one side ) . his apprehensions began to be excited ; and arousing the rest of the passengers . he communicated , in a very decided manner , his opinion that a dead man had been palmed upon them during the night for a living and responsible fellow traveller .
they piled the stiffs outside the door . they made , i reckon , a cord or more . girls went that winter , as a rule . alone to spellin' school , of course an afternoon tea is not to be taken seriously . and i hold that any kind of conversation goes .
sally was tingling all over , this reminded her of the dog fight on the roville sands . she wanted to be in it , and only the recognition that it was a private fight and that she would be intruding kept her silent . the lure of the fray , however , was too strong for her wholly to resist it . almost unconsciously , she had risen from her place and drifted down the aisle so as to be nearer the white hot centre of things . she was now standing in the lighted space by the orchestra pit , and her presence attracted the roving attention of miss [female] .
a little while before it had been two wild beasts , ready to tear each other to pieces . who had presented themselves at the foot of the tower . it was now two friends who reached its summit . the weather was superb , it was the month of may . the sun had absorbed all the vapours , what a pure and limpid atmosphere !
the roads to belair and mount lofty , to [location] . marble hill , moriatta , and a score of other places . give at numerous points fine views of the hills and the plain . and some of the waterfalls , notably the one at waterfall gully and at fourth creek . are eminently picturesque in a rugged way , i was advised to ignore all these beauty spots in favour of one .
daughter was on the lawn , seated under a canopy that had set father back thirty two dollars . there was a hired hand sprinkling the grass with a hose . and as will , the conversational drummer , came up the long walk , daughter called to the hired hand . and said : [male] , there is a strange man coming up the walk . change the direction of the stream somewhat , else you may dampen him .
miss [male] firmly cornered [male] , and heard what had happened , [male] had gone up to bed last night . not feeling well , without having any dinner , but he had told mrs. [male] to make him some soup . and he would not want anything else , his parlour maid had brought it to him . and had soon afterwards opened the door to major [male] . who , learning that his friend had gone to bed , went away , she called her master in the morning .
at last , after my tale of how i had guided the army across the danube . one universal shout of laughter broke from them all . i sprang to my feet . flushed with shame and anger , they had drawn me on . they were making game of me .
mark twain was at the pinnacle of his first glory . thirty six , in full health , prosperous , sought by the world 's greatest , hailed in the highest places almost as a king . [male] dreams of greatness had been all too modest . in its most dazzling moments his imagination had never led him so far . it was at the end of january .
one took a cold bath every morning and the other got drunk every night . this is about as far as the old song should be carried , perhaps it is too far . our plea today is for something of abatement in the intensity of the rivalry between [organization] and yale . to be sure we realize that the plea has been made before unsuccessfully by mightier men . indeed it was [male] himself .
i know many instances where our certainty was absolute . and also cases where we possessed legal proof as well . but legal proof which , for one reason or another , we dared not use in public . yet all this had no effect on the british authorities , they would never give up even the vilest criminal except on publicly attested legal evidence . and not even then , if the crime were political , during my term of office under the french government .
there is no average member of the public who would not prefer to have lloyd [male] discussed as what he is . a welshman of genius and ideals . strangely fascinated by bad fashion and bad finance , rather than discussed as what neither he nor anyone else ever was . a perfect democrat or an utterly detestable demagogue , there is no reader of a daily paper who would not feel more concern . and more respect -- for sir rufus isaacs as a man who has been a stockbroker .
precision is much , but not all ; some words and phrases are disallowed on the ground of taste . as there are neither standards nor arbiters of taste . the book can do little more than reflect that of its author , who is far indeed from professing impeccability . in neither taste nor precision is any man 's practice a court of last appeal . for writers all , both great and small , are habitual sinners against the light .
an irish counsel being asked by the judge for whom was he concerned . replied , `` i am concerned for the plaintiff , but i am retained by the defendant . '' when the late mr. [organization] 's father . the brewer , first opposed the duke of [organization] 's interest at [organization] . the duke informed him that he would spend £50,000 rather than he should come in .
the way small boats are managed at sea is even more wonderful than the way in which ships are sailed . to begin with , everybody sits sideways along the middle of the boat . all facing the starboard , they do not attempt to row , one man does all the work with one scull . this scull he puts down through the water till it touches the bed of the ocean . and then he shoves , `` deep sea punting '' would be the technical term for the method , we presume .
lisa , oh , listen to me , dear -- i love him only , darling ! remember , oh , my pet , on him my heart is set this kindness do me . dear nor leave me lonely , darling , be merciful , my pet , our love do not forget ! the die is cast , my hope has perished , farewell , o past . too bright to last , yet fondly cherished , my light has fled , my hope is dead .
they went directly to quarry farm , where clemens again took up work on his book . which he hoped to have ready for early publication , but his writing did not go as well as he had hoped . and it was long after they had returned to hartford that the book was finally in the printer 's hands . meantime he had renewed work on a story begun two years before at quarry farm . browsing among the books there one summer day .
furthermore , he felt that on the subject of [male] he was not really an authority . neither the advocate times , the evening advocate . nor the bulletin of the zenith chamber of commerce had ever had an editorial on the matter . and until one of them had spoken he found it hard to form an original opinion . but even at risk of floundering in strange bogs , he could not keep out of an open controversy .
he did not favor the secular clergy , and they . of course , disliked him accordingly , he suffered also at the hands of those who sought to operate the reigning apparatus whilst his attention was turned towards other matters . he was the author of the scheme whereby he utilized his enemies . the welsh princes , by demanding three hundred wolf heads per annum as tribute instead of money . this wiped out the wolves and used up the surplus animosity of the welsh .
yes , i have neighbored with about all sorts of religius believers . and never disputed that they had a right to their own religion . and i have seen them too that did not make a practice of goin to any meetin houses much , who lived so near to god and his angels that they felt the touch of angel hands on their forwards every day of their lives . and you could see the glow of the fairer land in their rapt eyes .
jill kissed him and moved away , she busied herself with some flowers . her back turned , the tension had been relieved , and she wanted to give him time to recover his poise . she knew him well enough to be sure that , sooner or later , the resiliency of his nature would assert itself . he could never remain long in the depths , the silence had the effect of making her think more clearly than in the first rush of pity she had been able to do . she was able now to review the matter as it affected herself .
even the servants loved her , the head gardener would bring a bouquet of beautiful roses to her room before she was up . the second gardener a bunch of early cauliflowers . the third a spray of late asparagus , and even the tenth and eleventh a sprig of mangel wurzel of an armful of hay . her room was full of gardeners all the time . while at evening the aged butler , touched at the friendless girl 's loneliness .
but the change in the appearance and costume of the men who crowded the streets was even more notable . the uniforms and the pointed helmets of two years ago had vanished utterly . the men that one saw retained indeed their german stoutness . their flabby faces , and their big spectacles , but they were now dressed for the most part in the costume of the russian monjik . while some of them appeared in [location] wideawakes and [location] frock coats .
if he were deficient there , nothing should make amends for it . but on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied , it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty . nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection . and there was time enough for [male] to form a reasonable judgment . as their visit included all the rest of the morning .
it was not large , being about eight feet square , nor was it very high . the walls were whitewashed , and the floor clean . a single small window , deep set in the thick stone built walls . looked out on to the yard , and by it stood the solitary piece of furniture . a somewhat rickety windsor chair .
this is surprising , considering that there were quite six of [location] present , but it is true . twenty-four by actual count remained when the last guest left me . the next morning i and my family took our departure for a month 's rest in the mountains . in the hurry of leaving home , and the worry of looking after three children and four times as many trunks . i neglected to include the cigars in my impedimenta , leaving them in the opened box upon my library table .
the power of caricature being greater in hats than in hair dressing . is it not fit that we should give careful and intelligent consideration to the selection of our millinery that the ugly lines in our otherwise beautiful faces may not be at the mercy of mocking bunches of ribbons . comically tilted straws , or floppy bits of lace ? once upon a time , i think that was the exact date , there was a man distinguished in a certain kingdom as the ugliest person in the realm . according to a blithe romancer , he was so distinctively unpleasing in form and feature that he challenged the attention of the king who .
in the third week of december , 1878 , taking the opportunity of a brief and undeserved vacation . i went to [location] , on the morning after my arrival . in answer to a most kind and cordial summons . i presented myself at the palazzo rezzonico . intense as was the impression he always made even in [location] .
for a wonderful physical tie binds the parents to the children . and -- by some sad , strange irony -- it does not bind [location] children to our parents . for if it did , if we could answer their love not with gratitude but with equal love . life would lose much of its pathos and much of its squalor . and we might be wonderfully happy , [female] passionately embracing , miss abbott reverently averting her eyes .
now , if this nobleman had but listened , he would have heard much that might interest an ordinary man . although i must say that during my three conversations with him his mind seemed closed to all outward impressions save and except the grandeur of his line . which he traced back unblemished into the northern part of my own country . the king 's visit had come as a surprise to the anarchists . and they did not quite know what to do about it , the [location] reds were rather in favour of a demonstration .
i tried that , but capital seemed coy . others had been there before me and capital bade me soak my head and said other things which grated harshly on my sensitive nature . the vanderbilt mine , with all its dips . spurs , angles , variations , veins . sinuosities , rights , titles , franchises .
in a fair valley -- oh , how long ago , how long ago , -- where all the broad expanse was clothed in vines . and fruitful fields and meadows starred with flowers . and clear streams wandered at their idle will ; and still lakes slept . their burnished surfaces a dream of painted clouds . and soft airs went whispering with odorous breath , and all was peace .
[female] down to the hollow , past the dryad 's bubble and up the spruce path to orchard slope . to ask diana to tea , as a result just after marilla had driven off to carmody . diana came over , dressed in her second best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked out to tea . at other times she was wont to run into the kitchen without knocking . but now she knocked primly at the front door , and when [female] .
matters were accordingly arranged on these lines , and for some minutes we continued chatting in desultory fashion . then the conversation petered out , i made a few observations in re the scenic effects . featuring the twilight hush , the peeping stars . and the soft glimmer of the waters of the lake . and she said yes , something rustled in the bushes in front of us .
[male] , or `` grizzly [male] , '' as he was generally termed . from the fact of his having captured so many grizzly bears . and encountered such fearful perils by his unexampled daring , was an extraordinary character . for many years a hunter and trapper in the rocky and sierra nevada mountains . he acquired a recklessness which , added to his natural invincible courage .
she laid awake crying half the night , nothing of the kind had ever occurred to her before . no one had ever accused her of any impropriety . no one had ever thrown it in her teeth that she was longing after fruit that ought to be forbidden to her . in her former obscurity and dependence she had been safe . now that she had begun to look about her and hope for joy in the world .
at five minutes to eleven on the morning named he was at the station . a false beard and spectacles shielding his identity from the public eye . if you had asked him he would have said that he was a scotch business man . as a matter of fact , he looked far more like a motor car coming through a haystack . the platform was crowded , friends of the company had come to see the company off .
thus i lived in a constant scene of self enchantment on the part of the sisters . who assumed all the port and feeling that properly belonged to ladies of quality . patrimonial splendor to come danced before their dim eyes ; and handsome settlements . gay equipages , and a general grandeur of some sort loomed up in the future for the [location] branch of the house of pettibone . it was a life of opulent self delusion .
it is quite certain that at the moment when the sisters came together in their own room . he appeared at the chamber door . and a marvellous contrast it was -- they so heated . noisy , and vehement ; he so calm . so self possessed , so cool and full of peace , that not a hair upon his head was stirred .
as i say , it was when [male] made money that they saw how gifted he was . and when he lost it , -- but still , there 's no need to go into that . i believe it 's something the same in other places too . the barber shop , you will remember . stands across the street from smith 's hotel .
precious tapestries , and lusters with great gilt chains . were drawn from the cupboards ; an army of the poor were engaged in sweeping the courts and washing the stone fronts . whilst their wives went in droves to the meadows beyond the loire . to gather green boughs and field flowers , the whole city . not to be behind in this luxury of cleanliness , assumed its best toilette with the help of brushes .
or sometimes the poor woman and her daughters go about timidly , giving lessons in english and music . or do embroidery and work under hand , to purchase the means for the pot au feu . while raff is swaggering on the quay , or tossing off glasses of cognac at the cafe . the unfortunate creature has a child still every year . and her constant hypocrisy is to try and make her girls believe that their father is a respectable man .
i did not even wait to ring the bell : i whizzed for the kitchen . bleating for [male] , and butted into the middle of a regular tea party of sorts . seated at the table were a depressed looking cove who might have been a valet or something . and a boy in a norfolk suit , the valet chappie was drinking a whisky and soda . and the boy was being tolerably rough with some jam and cake .
The Adventures of [male] by [male] at [organization] persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted . persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished ; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot . i make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding . you do not know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of [male] . but that ai not no matter , that book was made by mr. [male] twain .
never again , he knew beyond a question , would such an opportunity come within his grasp . he would be obliged to start out unheralded and painfully fight his way to recognition . that recognition would be his he did not doubt , for he never yet had failed in that to which he had set his hand . but , alas , the weary years before he would be able to make a hurrying universe sense that he was alive ! he knew what struggle meant when stripped of its illusions .
there were a lot of soldiers lining the streets and regiments of cavalry riding between . and it seems that when [male] saw the crowd and the soldiers he was drawn nearer and nearer by a sort of curiosity . and when he saw the great white veil drawn away from the monument . and read the word `` lusitania '' that is carved in large letters across the base . he screamed out in a sudden fear , and clashed among the horses of the cavalry and was ridden down .
on to the dresser her eye wandered , and was met by a riot of dirty dishes and plates . salmon tins , empty beer bottles . crusts of bread , reinforced by an old boot . the kitchen table held her attention for fully half a minute , the torn newspaper covering it was stained to every shade of black and brown and grey . the whole being composed by a large yellow splotch , where a cup of very liquid mustard had come to grief .
jill was thinking of derek , too , panic had fled . and a curious exhilaration had seized upon her , if derek wanted her now , it would be because his love was the strongest thing in the world . she would come to him like the beggar maid to cophetua . [male] broke the silence with a cough . at the sound of it , jill smiled again , she knew it for what it was .
nothing more passed between them as they went home . jonas kept a little in advance , and [male] sadly followed . thinking of the grief which the knowledge of this quarrel must occasion his excellent benefactor . when jonas knocked at the door , [female] 's heart beat high . higher when miss mercy answered it , and seeing her wounded lover , shireked aloud .
the breton bellowed for his fifty crowns ; the bailiffs persisted in declaring that they had never set eyes on the breeches , god forbid ! the attorney privately urged the alguazil to search colindres clothes , for he suspected she must have possessed herself of the fifty crowns . since it was her custom to grope in the pockets of those who took up with her company . colindres declared that the breton was drunk .
the man who gave [location] [male] said that he was a shetland terrier . frankly , i do not believe there is any such thing ; unless [male] is it . but there is no denying a scotch strain of some sort . there is a good deal of [male] knox about [male] . he recognizes no middle ground , there was no difficulty .
after a whispered conversation between [male] and mr. [male] . they both bore down upon mr. [male] , a small man seated next to a very large wife . and began an animated conversation with him in undertones . mr. [male] was genial , [male] pleading . and mr. [female] protesting and shrinking , mrs. [female] eventually terminated the discussion by giving his arm an upward push .
[female] , she cried as the door opened and a man entered . he advanced gladly to meet her , and in a moment mother and son were folded in a close embrace . it was [male] , the man from sing sing . true to his word , he had slipped away unostentatiously at the height of the festivities . `` alas , [male] , '' said the mother after the warmth of the first greetings had passed .
the best way of settling the matter is to give him the carrots and the black currants and the rhubarb for himself . to allow him a free hand with the groundsel and the walnut trees . and to insist in return for this that you should pick the peaches when and how you like . if he is a gentleman he will consent . supposing that some satisfactory arrangement were come to , and supposing also that you had a silver bladed pocket knife with which you could peel them in the open air .
but in either case he must praise , and what there is for him to praise just now it would be precious hard to say . and if there is no great hope of a real poet , there is still less hope of a real prophet . what [male] called , i think , `` the prophetical office , '' that is , the institution of an inspired protest even against an inspired religion . certainly would not do in modern england , the court is not likely to keep a tame prophet in order to encourage him to be wild .
addressed to his partner ; a remark which generally elicited the reply . `` oh , do not apologize , all 's well that ends well , '' the man i knew who made the most rapid fortune was a builder in the outskirts of [location] . who could not write his name , and who , for thirty years of his life . never went to bed sober , i do not say that forgetfulness of trumps should be cultivated by whist players . i think my builder friend might have been even more successful had he learned to write his name .
a blow glanced over mr. [male] 's left ear . and the flanking movement was completed , another blow behind the ear . heaven and earth spun furiously round mr. [male] . and then he became aware of a figure in a light suit shooting violently through an open gate into the night . the man in gaiters sprang forward past mr. [male] .
a spidery , youngish man from one of the platforms built out from the scaffold . now became sharply vocal through a megaphone to assistants who were bending the elements to the need of this particular hazard of hortense . he called directions to the men who tugged the rope . to the men in control of the lights . and to another who seemed to create the billows , among other items he wished more action for the boat and more water for the billows .
until the brakes are turned on time , life 's throttle valve shut down . he works to pilot in the crew that wears the martyr 's crown . on schedule time , on upper grade along the homeward section . he lands his train in god 's roundhouse the morn of resurrection . his time is full , no wages docked , his name on god 's pay roll .
pity is for the living , envy is for the dead . pudd'nhead [male] 's new calendar , when the white man came the continent was nearly as poor . in variety of vegetation , as the desert of sahara . now it has everything that grows on the earth . in fact , not australia only , but all australasia has levied tribute upon the [male] of the rest of the world .
for two cents i would have done these things , too ; but nobody offered me two cents . i tried to move that german 's feelings , but it could not be done . he would not give me his diploma . neither would he sell it to me . i told him my friend was sick and could not come himself .
you could see the sawdust trickling out of love 's young dream in a steady flow . i took mrs. [female] for a walk one afternoon . to see if i could not cheer her up a bit , but it was not much good . she hardly spoke a word till we were on our way home . then she said with a sort of jerk .
possibly mass and distance add something . at any rate , something is added , among other noticeable things . there is a dazzling , intense whiteness about the distant alpine snow . when the sun is on it , which one recognizes as peculiar . and not familiar to the eye , the snow which one is accustomed to has a tint to it .
we had yet another celebrity on board in the person of the bright little italian whose clever caricatures . especially those of newmarket and newmarket celebrities . so delight [location] in the pages of vanity fair over the nom [male] crayon `` lib . '' i think he caused [location] as much amusement as his sketches . caricaturing everybody on board , not even excepting himself .
i would not have any of my readers apply this story . as an unfortunate gentleman did , who had heard it , and was the next day whispering a rump of beef at a friend 's house , 76 . an english gentleman happening to be in brecknockshire , he used sometimes to divert himself with shooting . but being suspected not to be qualified by one of the little welch justices , his worship told him . that unless he could produce his qualification , he should not allow him to shoot there .
psmith , as pugilist , lacked something of the calm majesty which characterized him in the more peaceful moments of life . but he was undoubtedly effective , nature had given him an enormous reach and a lightness on his feet remarkable in one of his size . and at some time in his career he appeared to have learned how to use his hands . the first of the three runners , the walking stick manipulator , had the misfortune to charge straight into the old etonian 's left . it was a well timed blow , and the force of it .
a young man `` out west , '' claiming to be influenced by spirits , astonished people by reading names . telling time by watches , etc. , in a dark room . he sat at a centre table , which was covered with a cloth , in the middle of the room . investigators sat next the walls , the name of a spirit . for instance , would be written and laid on a table , when in a short time he pronounced it .
a lion from the atlas range at pistol range from him . a couple of strides off ? a lion . mind you -- the beast heroic and ferocious above all others . the king of the brute creation . the crowning game of his fancies , something like the leading actor in the ideal company which played such splendid tragedies in his mind 's eye .
in considering the work of such writers as these and the authors represented in this little pioneer volume one should bear continually in mind the many handicaps under which authorship labors in portuguese and spanish [location] . a small reading public , lack of publishers . widespread prevalence of illiteracy , instability of politics . under the circumstances it is not so much to be wondered at that the best work is of such a high average as that it was done at all . for in nations where education is so limited and illiteracy so prevalent the manifold functions which in more highly developed nations are performed by many are perforce done by a few .
i had seen the heads and faces of ten youths gashed in every direction by the keen two edged blades . and yet had not seen a victim wince , nor heard a moan . or detected any fleeting expression which confessed the sharp pain the hurts were inflicting . this was good fortitude , indeed , such endurance is to be expected in savages and prize fighters . for they are born and educated to it ; but to find it in such perfection in these gently bred and kindly natured young fellows is matter for surprise .
the study was still on view in almost its original condition of disorder . and all day comparative strangers flocked to see mill in his den . in order to inspect things , mill was a youth with few friends . and it is probable that more of his fellow seymourites crossed the threshold of his study on the day after the occurrence than had visited him in the entire course of his school career . brown would come in to [male] a knife .
mrs stumfold shook her head . and then went away without further speech , [female] immediately saw that she had been wrong . miss [female] was the stout , red-faced lady with the children . two of the children , girls of eleven and thirteen . were with her now , as miss [female] walked across the room to shake hands with her new acquaintance .
by now the study of bathing habits had become an obsession with me . i asked him whether he had encountered any bathtubs about the place . he said a bathtub in those altitudes was as rare as a chamois . and the chamois was entirely extinct ; so i might make my own calculations , but he said he could show me something that was even a greater curiosity than a bathtub . and he led me to where a moonfaced barometer hung alongside the front entrance of the hotel .
it was well enough , as a measure of precaution . but really it was not needed , you can trust me implicitly , m. bourget . i shall never call you any names in print which i should be ashamed to call you with your unoffending and dearest ones present . snobbery ... i could give mark twain an example of the [location] specimen . it is a piquant story , i never published it because i feared my readers might think that i was giving them a typical illustration of [location] character instead of a rare exception .
of course , they tell all sorts of little unspoken lies . just like anybody ; but they do not notice it until their attention is called to it . they have got me so that sometimes i never tell a verbal lie now except in a modified form . and even in the modified form they do not approve of it . still , that is as far as i can go in the interest of the growing friendly relations between the two countries .
ellador told me a lot about it . she took me to see the children . the growing girls , the special teachers , she picked out books for me to read . she always seemed to understand just what i wanted to know , and how to give it to me . while terry and alima struck sparks and parted .
for by the time these explanations took place . [female] was indeed makin a fuss , her emotion . at first , had been happily stimulated at sight of `` by [female] atwater . '' a singular tenderness had risen in her -- a tremulous sense as of something almost sacred coming at last into its own . and she hurried to distribute , gratis , among relatives and friends .
epochal as starting the car was the drama of parking it before he entered his office . as he turned from oberlin avenue round the corner into third street . [location] , he peered ahead for a space in the line of parked cars . he angrily just missed a space as a rival driver slid into it . ahead , another car was leaving the curb , and babbitt slowed up .
[female] said nothing , which was a good deal better than saying what he would have liked to have said . the train , which had been stopping everywhere for the last half hour , pulled up again . and [male] , seeing the name of the station . got up , opened the door , and hurled a gladstone bag out on to the platform in an emphatic and vindictive manner . then he got out himself and looked about him .
they never puzzle me with greek . nor drive me mad with ibsen ; yet over forms as fair as eve 's they wear the gowns of gibson . there was an affecting scene on the stage of a [location] theater the other night . a scene invisible to the audience and not down on the bills . but one far more touching and pathetic than anything enacted before the footlights that night .
in five weeks sherman had marched three hundred miles . had destroyed two railroads , had stormed fort mcallister , and had captured savannah , on the 5th and 6th of may . 1864 , occurred the battle of the wilderness , near the old battleground of chancellorsville . no one could describe it , for it was fought in the dense woods . and the two days of useless butchery with not the slightest signs of civilized warfare sickened both armies .
it 's just as necessary to make a good first impression in business as in courting . you will read a good deal about `` love at first sight '' in novels , and there may be something in it for all i know . but i am dead certain there 's no such thing as love at first sight in business . a man 's got to keep company a long time .
every few minutes the train would stop and then start up again on low , that meant the engineer suspected he was comin to a station and was scared that if he run too fast he would not see it . and if he run past it without stoppin the inhabitants would not never forgive him , you see . they 's a regular schedule o
the confederates who retreated from [location] fell back to island no , 10 in [location] . where commodore foote bombarded them for three weeks . thus purifying the air and making the enemy feel much better than at any previous time during the campaign . general pope crossed the [location] , capturing the batteries in the rear of the island . and turning them on the enemy , who surrendered april 7 , the day of the battle of shiloh .
almost reassured , he went to the cupboard and unlocked the door , alas ! it held its skeleton -- the statue was there . preserving the attitude of queenly command in which he had seen it first . sharply he shut the door again , and turned the key with a heavy heart . he swallowed his breakfast with very little appetite .
education , as she observed herself without regret . had not been compulsory throughout the waterside district of [location] in her young days . and , compelled to earn her own living from the age of thirteen . opportunity for supplying the original deficiency had been wanting , but she knew her subject . which was herself -- her experiences , her reminiscences .
it hai not the easiest thing in the world for such a woman as cicely to love . but it is a good deal easier for her than to unlove , as she found out afterwards . for twice before her marriage she saw him out of his head with liquor . and it wus my advice to her , to give him up . and she tried to unlove him , tried to give him up .
it snows heavily all the while she remains about , and the instant she goes it clears up again and keeps dry for the rest of the evening . the way the snow `` goes '' for that poor woman is most unfair . it always snows much heavier in the particular spot where she is sitting than it does anywhere else in the whole street . why , we have sometimes seen a heroine sitting in the midst of a blinding snow storm while the other side of the road was as dry as a bone . and it never seemed to occur to her to cross over , we have even known a more than unusually malignant snow storm to follow a heroine three times round the stage and then go off with her .
in seymour 's there was tumult and an impromptu indignation meeting . stanning had gone to work scientifically , from the moment that , ducking under the guard of a sturdy town youth . he had caught sight of sheen retreating from the fray . he had grasped the fact that here , ready made , was his chance of working off his grudge against him . all he had to do was to spread the news abroad , and the school would do the rest .
but there is a further complication , the more anarchic modern may again attempt to escape the dilemma by saying that education should only be an enlargement of the mind . an opening of all the organs of receptivity . light should be brought into darkness ; blinded and thwarted existences in all our ugly corners should merely be permitted to perceive and expand . in short , enlightenment should be shed over darkest [location] , now here is just the trouble . that , in so far as this is involved , there is no darkest [location] .
the villagers began to gather , loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event . but there was no whispering in the house ; only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there . none could remember when the little church had been so full before , there was finally a waiting pause . an expectant dumbness , and then aunt [female] entered , followed by [organization] and [female] . and they by the harper family , all in deep black , and the whole congregation .
in spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous . that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet . which mrs. [female] had just gone through by herself , the intelligence . which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another . her heart beat quick on hearing harriet 's footstep and voice .
after the costume , you should arrange to obtain a mask and a breath . the former is , of course , for the purpose of hiding your identity . the latter is essential at any party where you wish to remain inconspicuous . a good whisky breath can usually be obtained from a bottle of any of the better known brands of scotch or rye whisky by holding a small quantity of the liquor in the mouth for a short period of time . it is not , of course , necessary to swallow the liquor and in this connection i would suggest that you use only the best grade whisky .
with another apprehensive glance at the bull , mr. [male] turned and made towards the stile . his pace was strangely suggestive of a man cheating in a walking race . the sight of his quarry escaping seemed still further to enrage the bull . with a terrifying roar it dashed furiously at the gate . the sound of the roar lent wings to the feet of the flying mr. [male] .
often a little speech like this , hinting at hidden depths of indescribable emotion has touched ethelbertha . but to night she appeared strangely unsympathetic , with regard to heaven and its possible effect upon me . she suggested my not worrying myself about that , remarking it was always foolish to go half-way to meet trouble that might never come . while as to my being a strange sort of fellow , that , she supposed . i could not help , and if other people were willing to put up with me .
berridge was one of those who are skilled in cricket superstitions . but [male] did not get out , he took seven off [male] freece 's next over by means of two cuts and a drive . and , with [male] still exhibiting a stolid and rock like defence , the score mounted to eighty . thence to ninety , and so , mainly by singles . to a hundred , at a hundred and four , when the wicket had put on exactly fifty .
[female] was very friendly to the dramatic profession , and granted a charter to the shakspere company to play at the blackfriars . globe , prince , fortune and curtain theatres . in the coronation procession nine of the `` kings company '' appeared dressed out in fantastic array , wearing four yards and a half each of silk scarlet cloth . king [male] sent for shakspere and burbage and told them to be ever in readiness as the king 's servants to perform at any of the palaces that he might entertain domestic or foreign guests .
the strange stillness that brooded over the earth was made more uncanny still by cries that occasionally seemed to float in the air around us . behind , before , to the right , to the left , but never exactly beneath the car . we could hear people calling , and had a vague idea they were running after [location] and cheering . but we could distinguish no moving thing , yes ; once the gentleman from cambridge exclaimed that there were some pheasants running across a field below . but upon close investigation they turned out to be a troop of horses capering about in wild dismay .
the gathering shadows of night fall fast . the lamps in the street are lit ; to the roof have the eerie footsteps passed . where the outside passengers sit , to the passenger 's side has the spectre paced . for a moment he halts , they say . then a ring from the punch at the unseen waist .
was very fond of onions , and spying one on the counter as he went out of the store . he slipped it into his pocket . and strolling back to the wharf , sat down to an odoriferous breakfast of onions and herring . he munched away without finding anything unusual in the flavor . until just as he was through , down came mr , [male] , tearing along like a madman at the head of an excited procession of clerks .
the head retired to bed that night filled with a virtuous resolve to seek jim out on the following day . and speak a word in season to him on the subject of crime in general and betting in particular . this plan he proceeded to carry out as soon as afternoon school was over . when , however , he had arrived at the babe 's house . he found that there was one small thing which he had left out of his calculations .
there was a pause , and miss [female] knew that she had put [female] in a hole . if she successfully tried to get somebody else , miss [female] might find she could squeeze it in . and there would be nine , if she failed to get someone else , and miss [female] could not squeeze it in . then there would be seven ... [female] would not have a tranquil moment all day . `` ah , do squeeze it in , '' she said in those horrid wheedling tones which for some reason major [male] found so attractive .
the romans , who borrowed most of their customs from the greeks . also followed them in that of endeavoring to conciliate love by the power of philtres and charms . a fact of which we have not the least room to doubt . as they are in [male] and some other of the latin poets so many instances that prove it . but it depends not altogether on the testimony of the poets .
you say that he wishes to see me . and intends to write , now , there is a small business matter between us . which his lawyer seems much disposed to push on to a difficulty , if not to worse . to prevent this , if possible , -- at all events to see whether a visit from me might not be serviceable . i shall cross over to [location] on tuesday , and be with you by friday .
he was a man of great stature . with a fierce , hard face and a bristling black beard , which fell over his cuirass . i have been told since that he was noted for his strength and his bravery . and i could answer for it that he had the grip of a bear . for i had felt it when he tore me from my saddle .
as [male] watched , his small nose flattened against a corner of the window . [female] and dante arrived , having shared a taxi from the station . miss [female] , tall and gaunt and angular . presided in the robes of [female] , queen of scots . which was her favourite previous existence , then mr. [male] arrived .
several benches fell on me and i went to the mat feeling very sorry for myself . drill all day , my belt fell off and tripped me up . why do such things always happen to me ? somebody told [location] to do squads left and it looked as if we were playing ring around rosie . then we performed a fiendish and complicated little quadrille called a `` company square . '' i found myself , much to my horror .
lady [female] is , as everybody knows by referring to the `` british bible , '' a daughter of the great and good earl bagwig before mentioned . she thinks everything belonging to her the greatest and best in the world . the first of men naturally are the buckrams , her own race . then follow in rank the scrapers , the general was the greatest general .
menneville swore , as his comrades had sworn . that he would be as silent as the grave , and yet some one must have spoken . and as , certainly , it was not one of the nine companions , and quite as certainly . it was not [organization] , it must have been d'artagnan . who , in his quality of a gascon , had his tongue very near to his lips .
in this remote country , in this ancient duchy of bretagne . which was not [male] at that period , and is not so even now , the people knew nothing of the king of [male] . they not only did not know him , but were unwilling to know him . one face -- a single one -- floated visibly for them upon the political current . their ancient dukes no longer ruled them ; government was a void , nothing more .
it is my earnest desire to continue to keep them covered . i am not a professional beauty ; i am not even what you would call a good amateur beauty . and i want to make what little hair i have go as far as it conveniently can . but does the barber to whom i repair at frequent intervals coincide with my desires in this respect ? again i reply he does not , every time i go in i speak to him about it .
while incog. , [male] stopped at a hut . where he was asked to turn the pancakes as they required it . but in the absence of the hostess he got to thinking of esoteric subjects . or something profound , and allowed the cakes to [female] . the housewife returned in time to express her sentiments and a large box to his address as shown in the picture .
our friend 's satisfaction concerning his action was keen . but exceedingly brief , the wrathful condition of every physician in town was surpassing belief ! professional nurses were plunged in despair , and chemists shook passionate fists in the air . they called at his dwelling , with violence swelling . his greeting repelling with arrogant stare , they beat and they battered .
there was a little one horse town about three mile down the bend . and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for jim . so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing . the king allowed he would go , too , and see if he could not strike something . we was out of coffee , so jim said i better go along with them in the canoe and get some .
for my part , i desire to sweep off my old friends with the old year . and begin the new with a clean record , it is a measure absolutely necessary . the snake does not put on his new skin over the old one . he sloughs off the first , before he dons the second , he would be a very clumsy serpent . if he did not , one can not have successive layers of friendships any more than the snake has successive layers of skins .
phelan wrung his hands and took a turn around the room . now and again he stopped and shook his fist at the ceiling . and at last , beside himself , he made a rush for the door that led to the stairway . opening a crack , he listened , nothing but heavy silence beat down on him from above and he shivered . he looked back into the kitchen and his eye fell on the pile of cookbooks .
it is said that he then demonstrated his great fluency and readiness as a thinker and writer . he waded through the entire lot in two days with only two men from west pisa to assist him . galileo came out of it fresh and youthful , and all of the following night he was closeted with another inventor . a wicker covered microscope , and a bologna sausage , the investigations were carried on for two weeks . after which galileo went out to the inebriate asylum and discovered some new styles of reptiles .
but that evening , as you are going home in the tube . a burly working man treads heavily on your gouty foot , in ladbroke grove a passing hansom splashes you with mud . reaching home , you find that the cat has been at the cold chicken and the butler has given notice . you do not connect these things , but they are all alike the results of your unjust behaviour to your office boy in the morning . or , meeting a ragged little matchseller , you pat his head and give him six pence .
they receive high pay , but theirs is a dismal life . for they must live apart from their species , because their commerce with the dead defiles them . and any who should associate with them would share their defilement . when they come out of the tower the clothes they are wearing are exchanged for others . in a building within the grounds , and the ones which they have taken off are left behind .
the king 's words regarding the wounded pride of monk had inspired d'artagnan with no small portion of apprehension . the lieutenant had had , all his life , the great art of choosing his enemies . and when he had found them implacable and invincible , it was when he had not been able . under any pretense , to make them otherwise , but points of view change greatly in the course of a life . it is a magic lantern , of which the eye of man every year changes the aspects .
do not you know why i ran away ? to make you follow , i made you catch me . i made you kiss me , then you realized that we had been thrown together constantly . deliberately thrown together , if you care to know it -- and , well , that 's how many marriages are made . but i sha not marry on such terms , it 's indecent ! i am sorry , rex , but i am not for you .
the first thing i did on getting to the dining room was to open the window . i had half a mind to smash it . so as to give an extra bit of local colour to the affair . but decided not to on account of the noise , i had put my lantern on the table . and was just reaching out for it , when something happened , what it was for the moment i could not have said .
aline but bless me . [male] , many of the villages are married people ! [male] madam , this philtre is compounded on the strictest principles . on married people it has no effect whatever . but are you quite sure that you have nerve enough to carry you through the fearful ordeal ?
he did not like coming down this ghostly street , which his weak mind would persist in peopling with phantom crowds from long played picture dramas . it gave him the creeps . as he had more than once confessed , he hurried on , flashing his torch along the blind fronts of the shops in a perfunctory manner . he was especially nervous when he came to corners . and he was glad when he issued from the little street into the wider one that was well lighted .
mrs. [female] had , up to this time . been engaged in making a public example of certain ones of her grandchildren . who had been trespassing on the currant bushes of a neighbor , and had been caught in the act . their indulgent grandmother , being scandalized by this exhibition of youthful depravity . with a regard for the demands of strict justice that did her infinite credit .
the stock keeper arose , returned the remnants of his luncheon to his dinner pail and led the way up the stairs . he opened the door of the room [male] had used as a work room . and p. [male] walked in , the room was in some confusion . but , except in one or two particulars , no more than a work room is apt to be . a rather cumbrous machine -- the invention on which [male] had been working .
now that he remembered , he had come away from white plains hoping . indeed , never to see the place again , but undeniably a different man physically . it was not the habit of professor muldoon to let his patients loaf . but mr. [male] , after the initial plunge , had needed no driving , he had worked hard at his cure then . because it was the job in hand .
i yielded to that soulless and abominable creature . i kissed her ... and then she laughed , making a mock of me in my weakness . burning me with the hot iron of her scorn . piercing my heart with the daggers of her reviling . laughed , and slapped my face , laughed , and spat in my eye !
secondly , come the many legends and ballads handed on to me years ago by my aunt by marriage . one of the cornish smallnoses , she claims to be a direct descendant of that [female] smallnose whose lucky shot brought about the events which i am to describe . i say she claims to be , and one can not doubt a lady 's word in these matters . certainly she used to speak about [female] with that mixture of pride and extreme familiarity which comes best from a relation . in all matters not touching [female] , i feel that i can rely upon her .
he was dressed by nine , and had sat for two hours gloating over the prospect of steaming coffee and frizzling bacon . on that particular morning , however , there had been some domestic tragedy -- the firing of a chimney or the illness of a cook . and at eleven o'clock , not breakfast , but an apology for its absence had been brought to him . this embittered [male] , he gave up the unequal contest . and he has frequently confessed to me that cold breakfast is an acquired .
the redeemed captive had not altogether so much of the human angelic species : she seemed to be at least of the middle age . nor had her face much appearance of beauty . but her cloaths being torn from all the upper part of her body . her breasts , which were well formed and extremely white , attracted the eyes of her deliverer . and for a few moments they stood silent .
`` i hope it keeps fine for you , '' said the relative , and passed from the room looking like something out of an edgar allan poe story . i do not suppose i was looking so dashed unlike something out of an edgar allan poe story myself . for , as you can readily imagine , the news item which i have just recorded had got in amongst me properly . if the [organization] , in the belief that the wooster heart had long been hers and was waiting ready to be scooped in on demand .
he was working all the time , changing scenes . adding lines , tinkering with lyrics , smoothing over principals whose nerves had become strained by the incessant rehearsing . keeping within bounds mr goble 's passion for being the big noise about the theatre . his cheerfulness was due to the spirit that was in him . and jill appreciated it , she had come to feel very close to wally since the driving rush of making over the rose of [location] ', had begun .
come spring , [female] and i got restless hanging around the street . with nothing to do but stickball and baiting the super at forty six . it was so easy to get him sore , it was not even fun . cat stayed out of that basement , but i wanted to get him really out in the open . where he could chase squirrels or something .
i therefore bought five dozen tomato plants that were tender and large . these i fed to the cut worms at the rate of eight or ten in one night . in a week the cut worms had thrown off that air of ennui and languor that i had i formerly noticed . and were gay and light hearted , i got them some more tomato plants . and then some more cabbage for change , on the whole i was as proud as any young farmer who has made a success of anything .
square saw this matter in a very different light . he said , he could not perceive any higher crime in selling one book than in selling another . that to sell bibles was strictly lawful by all laws both divine and human . and consequently there was no unfitness in it , he told thwackum . that his great concern on this occasion brought to his mind the story of a very devout woman .
he went out by the farther archway , while from the entrance hall [male] could hear voices he knew only too well . the futvoyes had come ; well , at all events , it seemed that there would be something for them to eat . since fakrash , in his anxiety to do the thing thoroughly . had furnished both the feast and attendance himself . but who was there to announce the guests ? where were these waiters rapkin had spoken of ?
he was not too late ; the train was still at the platform . the engine getting up steam with a dull roar . but he dared not risk detection by travelling without a ticket . there was time for that , too , no one was at the pigeon hole but one old lady . but , unhappily , the old lady considered taking a ticket as a solemn rite to be performed with all due caution and deliberation .
and not only does one inaugurate business matters at lunch . but one also renews old friendships , who has not had said to him in the strand . hallo , old fellow , i have not seen you for ages . you must come and lunch with me one day ', ? and who has not answered , `` rather , i should love to , '' and passed on with a glow at the heart which has not died out until the next day .
the partitions convey sound like a drum head , and everybody knows it . but no matter , a german family who are all kindness and consideration in the daytime make apparently no effort to moderate their noises for your benefit at night . they will sing , laugh , and talk loudly , and bang furniture around in a most pitiless way . if you knock on your wall appealingly , they will quiet down and discuss the matter softly among themselves for a moment . then , like the mice , they fall to persecuting you again .
his forceful stroke never wavered , the head of his club struck the ball . despatching it a good two hundred yards down the middle of the fairway . as we left the tee i saw [female] merridew being led away with bowed head by two members of [organization] , poor girl ! my heart bled for her , and yet , after all , fate had been kind in removing her from the scene . even in custody , for she could hardly have borne to watch the proceedings .
`` not very dutiful , '' said her mother 's voice , fearing that she had offended [female] . she turned quickly round , there [male] was . he had crept in without interrupting her , `` oh , i had no idea ! '' she exclaimed , getting very red ; and then , without a word of greeting . she reopened the piano , [male] should have the parsifal .
let me introduce you to another effective laughter . you shall not hear a sound , yet you can not choose but laugh . if she does , quiet as she is about it . see how her shoulders shake , -- and look at her face ! every feature is instinct with mirth ; the color mounts to the roots of the hair .
my dear son. -- your letter of last week reached [location] yesterday . and i enclose dollar 13 , which is all i have by me at the present time . i may sell the other shote next week and make up the balance of what you wanted . i will probably have to wear the old buffalo overcoat to meetings again this winter . but that do not matter so long as you are getting an education , i hope you will get your education as cheap as you can .
back of these on three sides were raised platforms with other tables . and above these discreet boxes , half masked by drapery . for the seclusion of more retiring merry makers , the scene was deserted as yet . but presently he was joined by another early comer , a beautiful young woman of spanish type with a thin face and eager , dark eyes . her gown was glistening black set low about her [female] shoulders .
who was going to look after the cow , about to be separated from us ? young bute would be down again with plans , who was going to take him over the house . explain things to him intelligibly ? the new boy might turn up . this simple son of the soil miss [female] had promised to dig out and send along . he would talk berkshire , who would there be to understand him .
wonder how long we shall be before we get to stonnhurst , wonder if that 's my portmanteau that that elderly gentleman is taking away with him . wonder if they will send to meet me at the station . wonder whether there 's a fly or an omnibus , wonder what i shall do if they do not send . and there is not a fly or an omnibus , wonder if i shall have time to write a letter before dinner . wonder , for the sixth time , whether i gave my writing case to the guard .
something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between marilla cuthbert and mrs. [female] . in spite of -- or perhaps because of -- their dissimilarity , marilla was a tall . thin woman , with angles and without curves . her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it . she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience .
firby smith 's manner became ominously calm , he produced a swagger stick from a corner . what one really wants here is a row of stars , [male] was still full of his injuries when [male] came back . [male] was worn out , but cheerful , the school had finished sixth for the ashburton . which was an improvement of eight places on their last year 's form . and he himself had scored thirty at the two hundred and twenty seven at the five hundred totals .
his tongue ran on like a mill stream , i had to sit down and have the whole pullman car episode inflicted on me a second time . i was shown the receipt slip , i was shown the telegram from [male] . i was shown with a whoop the forget me nots , then he was going on saturday , i asked . he said he guessed it would take an earthquake to keep him away . and a pretty big earthquake , too , ... oh , it was a great moment .
the house had never been their own and their fortune had only been an annuity on their own lives . such is the depravity of the world , to your mother i should have returned with pleasure . should have been happy to have introduced to her , my charming sophia and should with chearfullness have passed the remainder of my life in their dear society in the vale of uske . had not one obstacle to the execution of so agreable a scheme , intervened . which was the marriage and removal of your mother to a distant part of [location] , adeiu [female] .
all beauty does not inspire love ; some please the sight without captivating the affections . if all beauties were to enamour and captivate , the hearts of mankind would be in a continual state of perplexity and confusion . for beautiful objects being infinite , the sentiments they inspire should also be infinite . true love can not be divided , and must be voluntary and unconstrained , the viper deserves no blame for its sting . although it be mortal -- because it is the gift of nature .
there was a book lying near alice on the table . and while she sat watching the white king ( for she was still a little anxious about him . and had the ink all ready to throw over him , in case he fainted again ) . she turned over the leaves , to find some part that she could read . `` -- for it 's all in some language i do not know , '' she said to herself .
fathers walk round among their daughters . choose the most likely specimen , and have her fattened up , that is their brutal eastern way . out west we shall be more delicate , match making mothers will probably revive the old confession book . eligible bachelors will be invited to fill in a page : `` your favourite height in women , '' `` your favourite measurement round the waist , '' `` do you like brunettes or blondes ? ''
i found i had to travel for my health , i went to lake bigler with my reportorial comrade , [female] . it is gratifying to me to reflect that we traveled in considerable style . we went in the pioneer coach . and my friend took all his baggage with him . consisting of two excellent silk handkerchiefs and a daguerreotype of his grandmother .
good , said hasbrouck , when the [female] column in the sunday paper began to be commented on and quoted ; and he made [male] an offer that seemed like sudden affluence . but the crowning triumph came still later , in a letter from the editor of one of the great magazines . [male] got it at the times office . and some premonition of its contents made him keep it until isobel could share it .
[male] tweed was the contractor of ludlow street jail . and here also he died , he was the son of a poor chair maker . and was born april 3 , 1823 , from the chair business in 1853 to [organization] was the first false step . exhilarated by the delirium of official life , and the false joys of franking his linen home every week . and having cake and preserves franked back to him at [location] .
the idea of the inferiority of female nature has drawn after it several others the most absurd . unreasonable , and humiliating to the sex , such is the pride of man . that in some countries he has considered immortality as a distinction too glorious for women . thus degrading the fair partners of his nature , he places them on a level with the beasts that perish . as the asiatics have , time immemorial , considered women as little better than slaves .
it was hard to leave a bright wood fire and go to bed at nine o'clock . but [male] was irresistible , he literally yawned [location] out of the room . up the staircase , and into the bed chamber , there was a key hanging by the outside of the door the size of a small club . and weighing several pounds , on the inside the keyhole , contrary to habitude , was in the centre of the door . from this point of approach it was .
it was the unfairness of the thing which hurt [female] . her conscience was clear , she knew girls . several girls -- who gave the young men with whom they walked out ample excuse for being perfect othellos . if she had ever flirted on the open beach with the baritone of the troupe of pierrots . like [female] oddy , she could have excused [female] 's attitude .
there are just two department stores in [location] where . according to the [location] viewpoint , the windows are attractively dressed . one of these stores is owned by an american , and the other , i believe . is managed by an american , in [location] there are many shops that are veritable jewel boxes for beauty and taste . but these are the small specialty shops , very expensive and highly perfumed , the [location] department stores are worse jumbles even than the english department stores .
it was impossible to persuade them that these missiles would not be accepted as deadly by savages . who of course would know no better ; and again , had not the first victory been won by these simple means ? so general tinling held his peace , and the western sky slowly changed from crocus to green . and from green to deep violet , and the evening star lighted its steady golden fire . the grasshoppers set up a louder chirp .
again the treacherous morning nap wiped out all traces of the pain and left the doctor still mercilessly obdurate on the subject of an opiate . not till the fifth day did a brief little southern note arrive informing him of the ordinary vital truths concerning a comfortable journey . and expressing a chaste hope that he would not forget her . not even surprise , not even curiosity , tempted stanton to wade twice through the fashionable , angular handwriting . dully impersonal , bleak as the shadow of a brown leaf across a block of gray granite .
when i got half-way , first one hound and then another got up and went for me . and of course i stopped and faced them . and kept still , and such another powwow as they made , in a quarter of a minute i was a kind of a hub of a wheel . as you may say -- spokes made out of dogs . circle of fifteen of them packed together around me .
he advertised a flower garden . and he had tried to give the public something as closely resembling a flower garden as it was possible for an overcrowded . overheated , overnoisy broadway dancing resort to achieve , paper roses festooned the walls . genuine tulips bloomed in tubs by every pillar . and from the roof hung cages with birds in them .
as they pegged the various items of the week 's wash to their respective lines . mrs. [female] watched from the back bedroom window . her eyes like points of steel . her lips a grim grey line . she was experiencing the sensations of the general who sees the enemy delivered into his hands .
for they were scotch and we were americans . citizens of the happy land where tips come from . undoubtedly that guide knew best , with pride and pleasure he showed [location] a representative assortment of [location] 's most popular and prominent murderers . the english dearly love a murderer , perhaps that is because they have fewer murderers than we have . and have less luck than we do in keeping them alive and in good spirits to a ripe old age .
the charity of closefist give to fame , he has at last subscribed , how much , his name . the play of `` king lear '' being performed at reading , the representative of glo'ster was . on one occasion , taken ill , and another actor was found to take the part at a short notice . he got on famously as far as the scene where glo'ster had his eyes put out .
then he recollected that in a quiet backwater off the high street there was a little confectioner 's shop . where tea might be had at a reasonable sum , and also , what was more important , peace . upstairs , at the same moment , the doctor was recommending that master [male] . the son of the house , be kept warm and out of draughts and not permitted to scratch himself . however necessary such an action might seem to him , in brief .
but they can not get what good there was originally meant to be in this institution . simply because they have not got enough money , the man ought to stand for a certain magnanimity . quite lawfully expressed in throwing money away : but if under given circumstances he can only do it by throwing the week 's food away . then he is not magnanimous , but mean , the woman ought to stand for a certain wisdom which is well expressed in valuing things rightly and guarding money sensibly . but how is she to guard money if there is no money to guard ?
although she had , as i recalled from the reports of the case . been compelled some years earlier to request the court to sever her marital relations with [female] on the ground of calculated and inhuman brutality . in that he had callously refused , in spite of her pleadings . to take old dr. [female] 's tonic swamp juice three times a day . her voice , as she spoke .
mrs. [female] 's mind worked backward and forward . she had one eye on the past . the other on the future , if she was strong on heredity . she was stronger on the future of the race . most of her published works dealt with this subject , a careful perusal of them would have enabled the rising generation to select its ideal wife or husband with perfect ease .
he said there would be quite enough hard work in towing sufficient food for [male] up against stream . as it was , i urged upon [male] . however , how much pleasanter it would be to have [male] clean and fresh about the boat . even if we did have to take a few more hundredweight of provisions . and he got to see it in my light .
i more than ever feel that vacancy in my heart , which your presence alone can fill . the mind , in every disquiet , seeks to repose itself on the bosom of a friend . and this is such a trial as i really know not how to support without your company and counsel . i must , therefore , dear letty , put your friendship to the test . i must beg you will come and do the last offices of maidenhood to your companion lydia melford .
going down the street , you would meet a typical commercial traveller . dapper and alert , [female] , you encountered a heavily bearded australian . later , maybe , it was a courteous old retired colonel who stopped you and inquired the way to trafalgar square . still later , a rather flashy individual of the sporting type asked you for a match for his cigar . would you have suspected for one instant that each of these widely differing personalities was in reality one man ?
perhaps it was just as well that juggins never married , it would have made things very difficult because . of course , he got poorer all the time . you see after he sold out his last share in his last business he bought with it a diminishing life annuity . so planned that he always got rather less next year than this year . and still less the year after , thus , if he lived long enough , he would starve to death .
if you did not , she said you did not think enough of her to let her share your life . if you gave her expensive presents and an unlimited credit account . she complained that you looked on her as a mere doll . and if you did not , she called you a screw . that was marriage , if it did not get you with the left jab .
[female] jumped to help , but it was needless ; the captive was already on the window sill . as [male] arrived , psmith dropped him on to the flower bed below . psmith closed the window gently and turned to [male] . `` who was our guest ? '' he asked , dusting the knees of his trousers where they had pressed against the wall . apparently frontal attack had been abandoned , whisperings could be heard in the corridor .
men and women and cattle were at work in the dewy fields by this time . the people often stepped aboard the raft , as we glided along the grassy shores . and gossiped with [location] and with the crew for a hundred yards or so . then stepped ashore again , refreshed by the ride , only the men did this . the women were too busy , the women do all kinds of work on the continent .
of course we made a joke of it after the child was gone . but somehow it did not seem to be our joke , i wish i could recollect my childhood . i should so like to know if children are as simple as they can look . my study window looks down upon hyde park . and often , to quote the familiar promise of each new magazine , it amuses and instructs me to watch from my tower the epitome of human life that passes to and fro beneath .
but it is not usually considered the office of friendship to turn on the betraying light . oh , well , her relatives would forgive in time . relatives have to forgive , it was unfortunate that [female] was not a relative . one thing , i know now how much mrs. [female] cares because i got those six votes ahead of her for the thursday club presidency . half a dozen copies , [female] said aloud as she caught sight of the spire of the mossdale church .
but to these women , in the unbroken sweep of this two thousand year old feminine civilization . the word woman called up all that big background . so far as they had gone in social development ; and the word man meant to them only male , the sex . of course we could tell them that in our world men did everything . but that did not alter the background of their minds , that man .
he was lulled to dreaming by the caressing warmth . the light fell on the inner surface of the tub in a pattern of delicate wrinkled lines which slipped with a green sparkle over the curving porcelain as the clear water trembled . babbitt lazily watched it ; noted that along the silhouette of his legs against the radiance on the bottom of the tub . the shadows of the air bubbles clinging to the hairs were reproduced as strange jungle mosses . he patted the water , and the reflected light capsized and leaped and volleyed , he was content and childish , he played .
all , they had all been wondering , it was worse than [male] could have imagined . till now he had pictured his position with regard to `` the girl from brighton '' company rather as that of some scientist who , seeing but unseen , keeps a watchful eye on the denizens of a drop of water under his microscope . and they had all detected him -- every one of them . it was a stunning blow , if there was one thing on which [male] prided himself it was the impenetrability of his disguises .
two minutes later the night was being made hideous by [female] 's almost tearful protestations of gratitude . and the postal order had moved from one side of the dormitory to the other . there were other things to make [male] that morning . to begin with , he was in detention , which in itself is enough to spoil a day . it was a particularly fine day , which made the matter worse .
for some days after the breaking off of diplomatic relations . [male] too pulverized to resume the offensive , he mooned about the links by himself . playing a shocking game , and generally comported himself like a man who has looked for the escape of gas with a lighted candle . in affairs of love the strongest men generally behave with the most spineless lack of resolution . wilton weighed thirteen stone , and his muscles were like steel cables .
now it so happened , that the agent having in charge the particular section of the temple in which [female] new office was located , had concealed from the young [location] the fact that for some twenty five or thirty years . the room which [location] had leased had remained unoccupied -- that is , it had never been occupied for any consecutive period of time during that number of years . tenants had come but had as quickly gone , there was something about the room that no one seemed able to cope with . luxuriously furnished or bare , it made no difference in the fortunes of number 17 .
with such emotion did clement utter these words . that [female] was in doubt whether they were spoken in courtesy only . or from love ; for the infernal plague of jealousy is so susceptible that it will take offence at the motes in the sunbeams . and the lover finds matter for self torment in everything that concerns the beloved object . nevertheless , he did not give way to confirmed jealousy .
in fact , within a year after [female] 's catastrophic visit to the bookshop the only thing in it that preserved any semblance of being up to date was miss masters . [female] had followed in the footsteps of mr. [male] and become an intolerable dowd . for [male] too , from a feeling compounded of loyalty and listlessness . had let his exterior take on the semblance of a deserted garden . he accepted the red felt skull cap as a symbol of his decay .
`` good night , '' she called over her shoulder . he could hear her laughing as she went down the road . a man 's subconscious self is not the ideal companion . it lurks for the greater part of his life in some dark den of its own . hidden away , and emerges only to taunt and deride and increase the misery of a miserable hour .
says tott , to fire it , but i was willing first to judge of its effect . the crowd about me trembled at this proposal . as they asserted it would overthrow not only the castle . but the city also ; at length their fears in part subsided . and i was permitted to discharge it , it required not less than three hundred and thirty pounds
perhaps the cricket was slow from the point of view of the follower of league football . but i do not feel that this is any condemnation of it , an essay of lamb 's would be slow to a reader of [male] 's works . who wanted a new body in each chapter , i shall not quarrel with anyone who holds that a day at lord 's is a dull day . if he thinks so , let him take his amusement elsewhere . but let him not quarrel with me , because i keep to my opinion .
`` give me his hat , '' said [male] in a silver voice . that the other obeyed like a bugle , `` and get inside with the swords . '' and just as the red and raging face of a policeman appeared above the wall . [male] struck the horse with a terrible cut of the whip and the two went whirling away like a boomerang . they had spun through seven streets and three or four squares before anything further happened .
we love her very dearly , said the marchioness , i am sure you do . and he is so proud of her , lady [female] had said that the woman was detestable . and therefore the marchioness felt that she ought to detest her . but , had it not been for lady [female] , she would have been rather pleased with her guest than otherwise . she did not remain very long , but promised that she would return on the next day .
but , at fifteen , adair bowled him , and when , two runs later . psmith got the next man stumped , and finished up his over with a c and b . [male] decided that it was not good enough , seventeen for three . with an hour all but five minutes to go , was getting too dangerous , so drummond and rigby . the next pair , proceeded to play with caution , and the collapse ceased .
about the year 1600 there was both hanged and burned at amsterdam a poor demented dutch girl . who alleged that she could make cattle sterile , and bewitch pigs and poultry by saying to them `` turius und shurius inturius . '' i recommend to say this first to an old hen , and if found useful it might then be tried on a pig . not far from the same time a woman was executed as a witch at bamberg . having , as was often the case , been forced by torture to make a confession .
i will take one case that will serve both as symbol and example . the case of color , we hear the realists talking about the gray streets and the gray lives of the poor . but whatever the poor streets are they are not gray ; but motley , striped , spotted . piebald and patched like a quilt , hoxton is not aesthetic enough to be monochrome . and there is nothing of the celtic twilight about it .
room mate , dan slote , he found there other ship comrades . including [male] and [male] , it was a joyful occasion . but one still happier followed it , young [male] 's father and sister olivia were in [location] . and an evening or two later the boy invited his distinguished `` quaker city '' shipmate to dine with them at the oldnicholas hotel .
the magistrate said , it appeared that the collegian . by this unprincipled trick , had `` killed two birds with one stone , '' he had rid himself of his creditor and his mistress at once . the stratagem , he said , was the more unprincipled , inasmuch as it was played off upon foreigners . who were utterly ignorant of the customs of the country .
in the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him . while harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete . her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm . with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after harriet 's own account had been given . he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms .
well , well , interrupted the [female] , we will take a few cords . under the circumstances , and he returned to his game of brag . in about half an hour we felt the caravan commence paddling again . supper was over , and i retired to my upper berth , situated alongside and overlooking the brag table . where the [male] was deeply engaged , having now the other pilot as his principal opponent .
we could take the lady by force or by craft . but we could not take her by right , for the law was against us . this was what my friend explained to me as we crept up toward the shelter of a shrubbery which was close to the windows of the house . thence we could examine this fortress . see whether we could effect a lodgment in it .
trevor could never understand how any one could find term time dull , for his own part . there always seemed too much to do in the time , `` you are not allowed to play games ? '' he said , remembering something about a doctor 's certificate in the past . `` no , '' said ruthven , `` thank goodness , '' he added , which remark silenced [male] . to a person who thanked goodness that he was not allowed to play games he could find nothing to say .
the whistles completed , i was marched , with music . to the place where the `` jacks '' grew , it was just such a place as boys instinctively delight in . low , damp , and boggy , with a brook hiding treacherously away under overhanging ferns and grasses . the children knew by sight the plant which bore the `` jacks , '' and every discovery was announced by a piercing shriek of delight .
to win two ripton matches in the same year was almost unheard of . this year there had seemed every likelihood of it . the match before christmas on the ripton ground had resulted in a win for [male] by two goals and a try to a try . but the calculations of the school had been upset by the sudden departure of paget at the end of term . and also of bryce , who had hitherto been regarded as his understudy , and in the first ripton match the two goals had both been scored by paget .
some gave it all to the prince of wales . declaring that his royal highness had done it out of his own head . and others were sure that the whole business had originated with a certain philanthropical mr manfred [male] who had lately come up in the world . and was supposed to have a great deal to do with most things , be that as it may . this thing did grow and become great , and there was a list of lady patronesses which included some duchesses .
i meditated pretty freely as i drove down to brinkley in the old two seater that afternoon . the news of this rift or rupture of angela 's and tuppy 's had disturbed me greatly . the projected match , you see , was one on which i had always looked with kindly approval . too often , when a chap of your acquaintance is planning to marry a girl you know . you find yourself knitting the brow a bit and chewing the lower lip dubiously .
or some spavined elder who not only rubbed it into them . but was apt , between strokes , to bore them with personal reminiscences of the crimean war . so they began to play together early and late , in the small hours before breakfast . long ere the first faint piping of the waking caddie made itself heard from the caddie shed . they were half-way through their opening round .
in their homes a large part of their time will have to be spent keeping their numerous ingenuities in good working order . their elaborate bell ringing arrangements , their locks and their clocks . in the field of science to be sure , this fertility in invention will lead to a long list of important and beautiful discoveries . telescopes and the calculus , radiographs , and the spectrum . discoveries great enough , almost , to make angels of them , but here again their simian ness will cheat them of half of their dues .
the ten men whose duels i had witnessed did not go away when their hurts were dressed . as i had supposed they would , but came back , one after another , as soon as they were free of the surgeon . and mingled with the assemblage in the dueling room , the white cap student who won the second fight witnessed the remaining three . and talked with [location] during the intermissions , he could not talk very well . because his opponent 's sword had cut his under lip in two , and then the surgeon had sewed it together and overlaid it with a profusion of white plaster patches .
not a hundred yards away , at a drug store . was one of those fickle minded , variable thermometers , showing a temperature that ranged from fifty five on downward to forty . but the hotel thermometer stood firm at sixty one . no matter what happened , in a season of trying climatic conditions it was a great comfort . a [male] really -- not only to its owner but to his guests .
his age was about seven , he looked older from the venerable whiteness of his head . and it was impossible to conjecture his size , as he always wore clothes apparently belonging to some shapely youth of nineteen . a pair of pantaloons , that , when sustained by a single suspender . completely equipped him , formed his every day suit , how , with this lavish superfluity of clothing . he managed to perform the surprising gymnastic feats it has been my privilege to witness .
of course , his subjects loved him in a way . a new statue had been erected in the palace square . showing him in the act of getting out of casual water . the minstrels had composed a whole cycle of up to date songs . commemorating his prowess with the mashie , his handicap was down to twelve .
but now let [location] consider the spiritual exaltation that comes when you are at last let down and turned loose . it is all over , and what did it amount to ? why , nothing at all , a ha ha ha ha ha ! nothing at all , you suddenly develop a particular friendship for the dentist . a splendid fellow , really , you ask him questions about his instruments . what does he use this thing for , for instance ?
but he never relinquished his efforts to make [male] conform to it . his ideal was a gentle boy of exquisite courtesy and of intellectual pursuits . such a boy he could have loved , it was hard that fate had endowed him with a godson like [male] . [male] was neither quiet nor gentle , nor courteous nor intellectual -- but [male] was intensely human . the length of [male] 's visit this year was beginning to reach the limits of [male] 's patience .
young mr. [male] occupied a front seat in one of the boxes till the conclusion of the first piece . then , having nothing else to do , he looked round the house . suddenly he espied a party of his friends . male and female , in the very next box . they occupied the front seat and part of the second .
the expedition then journeyed homeward after its long absence and its faithful endeavors . and was received with a mighty ovation by the whole grateful country , there were vulgar . ignorant carpers , of course , as there always are and always will be ; and naturally one of these was the obscene tumble bug . he said that all he had learned by his travels was that science only needed a spoonful of supposition to build a mountain of demonstrated fact out of . and that for the future he meant to be content with the knowledge that nature had made free to all creatures and not go prying into the august secrets of the deity .
five o'clock struck by the old church clock close by . [male] was upon his feet in an instant . and with a wild whoop and shout he was scudding across the green . his curls flying in the wind , and his little feet hardly seeming to touch the ground . there was none in the village so quick footed as [male] .
we could see the streams which fed the torrent we had followed issuing from under the greenish ramparts of glaciers . but two or three of these , instead of flowing over the precipices , sank down into the rock and sprang in big jets out of holes in the mid face of the walls . the green nook which i have been describing is called the gasternthal . the glacier streams gather and flow through it in a broad and rushing brook to a narrow cleft between lofty precipices . here the rushing brook becomes a mad torrent and goes booming and thundering down toward kandersteg .
once or twice at the beginning he shook his massive head . and replied the secret was not his , the last time he did this i assured him that what he said was quite correct . and then i related full particulars of the situation in which he found himself . excepting the names , for these he had not mentioned , i had pieced together his perplexity from scraps of conversation in his half hour 's fishing for my advice . which , of course , he could have had for the plain asking .
there was a vast crowd in the public grounds that night to hear the band play the `` fremersberg . '' this piece tells one of the old legends of the region . how a great noble of the middle ages got lost in the mountains , and wandered about with his dogs in a violent storm . until at last the faint tones of a monastery bell . calling the monks to a midnight service .
when my heart is dreary then my soul is weary as a bird with a broken wing who never again will sing like the sound of a vast amen that comes from a church of men . when my soul is dreary it could never be cheery but i think of myideal and everything seems real like the sound of the bright church bells peal . poems by [female] atwater will be in the paper each and every sat . miss patty fairchild of this city has not been doing as well in declamation lately as formerly . mr. [male] dill of this city is seldom seen on the streets of the city without smoking a cigarette .
mortimer sat down on the tee box , and buried his face in his hands . for a time he could think of nothing but the cruel blow he had received . this was the end of those rainbow visions of himself and her going through life side by side . she lovingly criticizing his stance and his back swing . he learning wisdom from her , a croquet player !
he did not , whatever his reason was , but led her quickly down and disappeared himself . without loosening his cloak , or pausing on the crowded deck one moment longer than was necessary to clear their way to that part of the vessel . [male] had not heard this little dialogue ; for his attention had been engaged in an unexpected manner . a hand upon his sleeve had caused him to look round . just when mrs gamp concluded her apostrophe to the steam engine .
well , then , you do not know how it is , but i guess you play poker . well , let 's go down into the town and hunt up some quiet barroom and have a civilised evening . this scenery gives me the creeps . i am with you , but where are we going to get any chips ? and yet , and yet -- is not all this contumely a part of my punishment ?
he may have meant to be funny , or he may not , some of those standing near took him one way . others the other , some gravely bowed their heads , others burst into guffaws , the g.m . often puzzled his staff in that way , all were anxious to do the right thing by him . but he made it so difficult to tell what the right thing was . but , as i went down the basement stairs to change my coat in the clerks
it is very clear to the doctor that his wife 's mind was made up on the subject . and yet there was no softer hearted woman than mrs. wortle anywhere in the diocese . or one less likely to be severe upon a neighbour , not only was she a kindly . gentle woman , but she was one who always had been willing to take her husband 's opinion on all questions of right and wrong . she , however , was decided that they must go , on the next morning .
`` do you keep him in there ? '' i asked . pointing to the coal black cupboard like room into which this strange creature had disappeared , `` yes , '' said the chief , and he likes it . often he stays there for days at a time . only coming out for air , at this juncture there came from the dark room the sounds of breaking glass .
emotion that could only be expressed in words and not through his usual medium welled up in mr macginnis . he sprang forward with a snarl , falling back as my faithful automatic caught his eye . [male] wavered , then allowed himself to be drawn away , we passed out of the classroom in our order of entry . an exclamation from the stairs made me look up . [female] was leaning over the banisters , her face was in the shadow .
for your german does not encourage laziness in any living thing . he likes to see his dogs work . and the german dog loves work ; of that there can be no doubt , the life of the english dog must be a misery to him . imagine a strong , active , and intelligent being , of exceptionally energetic temperament , condemned to spend twenty-four hours a day in absolute idleness ! how would you like it yourself ?
as i popped my head into the kitchen . little ugly was just vanishing at the opposite door , i could not make [female] tell me what miss [female] put under her arm . as she looked over her shoulder at me . and darted out of sight , o my noisy boots , i might as well wear a [organization] round my neck . stage wheels are rattling up the road , now they run upon the grass before the door .
3 , do not submit to harsh or cursory remarks from the adjutant , do answer him back . you know quite well that in private life you would not put up with his hasty . ill considered and offensive language , nor permit him to hector you because your collar was not clean . and if you have come on parade without cleaning your belt or rifle . what right has he to say that it makes him furious ?
when i stood before the open door , all the scene broke upon me . on her bed of straw , evidently at the point of death . lay my poor doggess , her eyes had almost lost their fierce expression . and were becoming fixed and glassy -- a slight tremor in her legs and movement of her stumpy tail . were all that told she was yet living ; not even her breast was seen to heave .
these reflections were the only impediments which were able to retard the progress of d'artagnan . these reflections once made , he increased the speed of his horse . but , however perfect his horse zephyr might be , it could not hold out at such a pace forever . the day after his departure from [location] . his mount was left at chartres , at the house of an old friend d'artagnan had met with in an hotelier of that city .
nothing could be more fitting and symbolic than that the first morning of his return to [location] should find him propped up in bed reading the good old chronicle . among his final meditations as he dropped off to sleep was a gentle speculation as to who was city editor now and whether the comic supplement was still featuring the sprightly adventures of the doughnut family . a wave of not unmanly sentiment passed over him on the following morning as he reached out for the paper . the sky line of [location] , seen as the boat comes up the bay . has its points , and the rattle of the elevated trains and the [male] odour of the subway extend a kindly welcome .
during the whole time i never heard a word from [female] . i wrote at least fifty letters to her , but as i learned afterward , and , indeed . surmised at the time , every one of them was intercepted by her father or brothers . and she did not know where i was and so could not write to me . i left [location] in may and went down to [location] , i had some business there which was soon transacted .
no amount of horse racing can damn this community . it was a stirring spectacle ; stirring in more ways than one . for it was amazingly funny , and at the same time deeply pathetic ; for they had seen so much . these time worn veterans , and had suffered so much ; and had built so strongly and well . and laid the foundations of their commonwealth so deep , in liberty and tolerance .
it may be as well to mention here that the whole of this book was planned . and at least three fourths of it actually written , in those happy days . which now seem so pathetically distant , when we were still at peace -- days when . to all but a very few , so hideous a calamity as a world war seemed a danger that had passed for the present . and might never recur ; when even those few could hardly have foreseen that england would be so soon compelled to fight for her very existence against the most efficient and deadly foe it has ever been her lot to encounter .
her lips parted , as if she were about to speak , but she said nothing . then she turned again , and began to walk slowly upstairs , he stood watching her till she had reached the top of the long flight . she did not look back , peggy 's nightly visits began afresh after this , and the ghost on the table troubled rutherford no more . his restlessness left him , he began to write with a new vigour and success . in after years he wrote many plays .
these little conversations represented only the first stage , the argumentative stage of the great contest . it was during this period , for example . that the mariposa newspacket absolutely proved that the price of hogs in mariposa was decimal six higher than the price of oranges in southern [location] and that the average decennial import of eggs into missinaba county had increased four decimal six eight two in the last fifteen years more than the import of lemons in [location] . figures of this kind made the people think , most certainly . after all this came the organizing stage and after that the big public meetings and the rallies .
i was so maddened by this slight , and so thoroughly apprehensive of further trouble from the infernal shade . that i resolved without more ado to sneak out of england and back to [location] before the deadly blighting thing was aware of my intentions . i immediately left the savoy , and sought the office of the green star line . secured a room on the steamer sailing the next morning . the digestic -- from liverpool , and was about packing up my belongings , when it turned up again .
mr. [male] , however , as the author of play making . knows that it is wrong to fool an audience , and so he kills only one of the beleaguered party . which is hardly a misfortune , since it enables the heroine . after a decent period of mourning , to marry the man she loves . as the scriptures have it , joy cometh in the mourning .
thus was mrs. [organization] dearest desire at last attained ; she could now inform her friends and acquaintances that her boy was actually a subaltern . while , even in conversation with strangers , it was always possible to lead up to the fact by enlarging on the heavy cost of a cavalry officer 's kit . and yet , in fairness to her , it may be said that , with all her striving after social distinction . if she had been required to choose between her son returning to the front with a commission and keeping him at home with no higher rank than that of a corporal . she would have chosen the latter without a moment 's hesitation .
grooms might be born bow legged and tailors born cross legged ; perfumers might have long . large noses and a crouching attitude , like hounds of scent . and professional wine tasters might have the horrible expression of one tasting wine stamped upon their faces as infants . whatever wild image one employs it can not keep pace with the panic of the human fancy . when once it supposes that the fixed type called man could be changed .
here evidently , was one of those trusty old retainers you read about , faithful , willing . discreet , ready to do anything for `` the little missy '' probably he had danced [male] on his knee in her infancy . and with a dog like affection had watched her at her childish sports , [male] beamed at the honest fellow . and felt in his pocket to make sure that a suitable tip lay safely therein .
at the age of 17 , [male] got disgusted with his brother . and went to [location] and [location] , where he got a chance to `` sub '' for a few weeks . and then got a regular `` sit. '' [organization] was a good printer . and finally got to be a foreman , he made an excellent foreman . sitting by the hour in the composing room and spitting on the stone .
ashe was not normally a young man of particularly ready wit . but on this occasion it may have been that the shock of this revelation . added to the fact that something must be done speedily if joan 's discomposure was not to become obvious to all present . quickened his intelligence , joan , usually so sure of herself . so ready of resource , had gone temporarily to pieces , she was quite white .
a drunken man , living in one of these villages , could never hope to get home . he would have to sit down outside , and wait till his head was clear . we witnessed the opening scenes of a very amusing little comedy at one of the towns where the train drew up . the chief characters were played by an active young goat , a small boy . an elderly man and a woman , parents of the small boy and owners of the goat .
as a gratifying proof of our progressing civilisation , there has been of recent years a very marked decrease in the number of white mice . and monkeys dressed as soldiers , exhibited by organ grinders in the [location] streets . trained dogs appear , however , decidedly more numerous , and performing canaries may be met with not infrequently in the squares of the west end . the naturalist should note , moreover , that the learned british pig which , within the memory of men who are still living . used commonly to infest the fairs near the metropolis , has recently well nigh completely disappeared and is believed by sundry naturalists to be utterly extinct .
i had been fortunate enough to secure quarters which had been recommended to me in a comfortable boarding house in one of the old-fashioned inns in holborn , thavies inn -- in which , i was informed , whether accurately or not i do not pretend to know . the knight templars of old had once resided , there were no knight templars there when i arrived . but in their stead i found some highly proper and non belligerent clerics with their wives and families . and other visitors from the country , who seemed very satisfied with the comfortable provision that was made for them .
Who Was Who: 5000 BC – 1914 by [female] at [organization] the editor begs leave to inform the public that only persons who can produce proper evidence of their demise will be admitted to who was who . press agent notices or complimentary comments are absolutely excluded . and those offering to pay for the insertion of names will be prosecuted , as persons become eligible they will be included without solicitation . while the pages will be expurgated of others should good luck warrant . who was who contains over 500 biographies of those who did or endeavored to become famous .
where miss [female] enumerates the pitfalls which the candidate must avoid and points out qualities which every good piece of writing should have . [female] writes a delightful essay on `` the profession of letters '' or `` a gossip on romance , '' these essays are very inspiring . they are too inspiring , they make the reader feel that he can go out and write like [male] . and then a lot of two cent stamps are wasted and a lot more editors are cross when they get home at night .
i mounted flight after flight of stairs . till i eventually found myself at the top of the house . in an apartment pervaded by a strong odour of chemicals . and glazed along the roof and the whole of one side with panes of a bluish tint . it was empty at the moment of my entrance .
`` england , my england , '' he moaned . it was indeed a sight to extract tears of blood from any boy scout . the table had been moved back against the wall , and in the cleared space mr. [male] . whose duty it was to have set an example to his children . was playing diabolo , beside him , engrossed in cup and ball .
[female] brain was not only very large , but it was in good order all the time . sometimes nature bestows large brains on men who do not rise to great prominence . large brains do not always indicate great intellectual power , these brains are large but of an inferior quality . a schoolmate of mine used to wear a hat that i could put my head and both feet into with perfect ease . i remember that he tied my shirt one day while i was laying my well rounded limbs in the mill pond near my childhood 's home .
so we are leaving him , and when i am in the mood for beauty i look at [male] 's mahogany sides and am soothed into slumber again ... and when i want to adjust my watch , i creep under the spare room bed and consult [male] . [male] alone of all our family keeps the correct time . and it is a pity that he alone must live in retirement . what i say is this : a man has his own work to do , he slaves at the office all day .
from here the progress of the tram across the plain was in full view . so , too , was the shed-like station across the river , which was the terminus of the line . and expectation , when the two waggoned little train approached the end of its journey . was so tense that it was almost disagreeable , a couple of hours had elapsed since . like the fishers who sailed away into the west and were seen no more till the corpses lay out on the shining sand .
because , mind you , the mariposa girls are all right . you have only to look at them to realize that , you see . you can get in mariposa a print dress of pale blue or pale pink for a dollar twenty that looks infinitely better than anything you ever see in the city . especially if you can wear with it a broad straw hat and a background of maple trees and the green grass of a tennis court . and if you remember , too , that these are cultivated girls who have all been to the mariposa high school and can do decimal fractions .
when everything was still once more , i crept out of bed , sick and feeble . and lit the gas with a hand that trembled as if it were aged with a hundred years . the light brought some little cheer to my spirits , i sat down and fell into a dreamy contemplation of that great footprint in the ashes . by and by its outlines began to waver and grow dim , i glanced up and the broad gas flame was slowly wilting away . in the same moment i heard that elephantine tread again .
even we grown-up children hear his piping now and then . but the yearning notes are very far away , and the noisy . blustering world is always bellowing so loud it drowns the dreamlike melody . one day the sweet , sad strains will sound out full and clear . and then we too shall , like the little children , throw our playthings all aside and follow .
this unfortunate prince lived so little a while that nobody had him to draw his picture . he was murdered by his uncle 's contrivance . whose name was [male] the 3rd , the character of this prince has been in general very severely treated by historians . but as he was a york , i am rather inclined to suppose him a very respectable man . it has indeed been confidently asserted that he killed his two nephews and his wife .
he had sent for [male] westlock immediately on his arrival . and [male] , under the conduct of [male] . had waited on him , having a lively recollection of mr tapley . he had caused that gentleman 's attendance to be secured . through [male] 's means , without delay .
just then the sheik discovered peggy , who , pretty as a picture . drew near the strange group , to her amazement two slaves rushed forward and obstructed her passage long enough to beat their heads on the deck a few times . after which they arose and tendered two magnificent necklaces , she was prepared for the proposal . but this action disconcerted her ; she gasped and looked about in perplexity . her friends were smiling broadly and the sheik had placed his hands over his palpitating heart .
i said to myself that my eclipse would be sure to save me . and make me the greatest man in the kingdom besides . and straightway my mercury went up to the top of the tube . and my solicitudes all vanished , i was as happy a man as there was in the world . i was even impatient for tomorrow to come , i so wanted to gather in that great triumph and be the center of all the nation 's wonder and reverence .
and i , with spontaneous gallantry , retorted that she was justified in such parsimony . since her daughter 's eyes supplied such fairy illumination . and upon her cheeks was a bloom brighter than many geraniums . but this compliment she unhappily mistook as an insinuation that her complexion was of meretricious composition . and seeing that i had put my foot into a cul de sac , i became once more the silent tomb .
now , although there were certainly ladies coming upstairs , there was no reason for alarm . they were probably friends of the man who kept opposite . and was always having his people up , but flushington had one of those odd presentiments . so familiar to nervous persons , that something unpleasant was at hand . he could not imagine who these ladies might be , but he knew instinctively that they were coming to him !
she could not look at him , yet could not keep herself from looking at him . there was something here that arose out of the depths of natural character . it was intrinsic in the two personalities , that is to say ; and was in addition to the bitterness consequent upon a public experience . just past , which had been brought upon mrs. silver partly by the dog 's appearance ( in particular the style and colour of his hair ) . and partly by his unprecedented actions in her company upon the highway .
for three days he held a conductorship on a broadway surface car . he was dismissed from this business for refusing to steal a nickel . such , reader , is the horrid degradation of business life in [location] . meantime the days passed and still [male] found no work . his stock of money was exhausted , he had not had any money anyway .
the full horror of his position was revealed to [male] in the relieved . confident , proprietor 's smile of miss boke . for [female] lived by a code from which no previous experience had taught him any means of escape . mrs. [female] had made the statement . so needless and so ruinous -- that he had no engagements ; and in his dismay he had been unable to deny this fatal truth .
in the course of his lark he managed to make a wide breach in one of the university 's most stringent laws . sequel : before noon , next day . he was in the college prison . booked for three months , the twelve long weeks dragged slowly by . and the day of deliverance came at last , a great crowd of sympathizing fellow students received him with a rousing demonstration as he came forth .
even if they had been discovered , they would have revealed nothing . because the first turn of the button lit the electric light at the head of my bed . the second turn put it out ; and this would happen as often as the button was turned to the right . but turn it three times slowly to the left . and the steel door opened , its juncture was completely concealed by panelling .
it was not till sir [male] had smoked his third cigar that he seated himself at his writing table . he then wrote rapidly a brief note , of which he proceeded to make a careful copy . this he folded and placed in an envelope , addressing it to his grace the duke of cloudeslie . a few minutes afterwards he began to prepare for bed . the day was already breaking , and yet that sick man was unwearied and unwasted .
from his place at the other crease [female] could see miss [female] and her mother sitting under the trees . watching the game , the sight nerved him . by the time he had played through his first over he had reduced [male] 's lead by half . an [male] would have hit out in such circumstances , and [male] was always an aggressive batsman . by the end of the third over the scores were level , each had made 20 .
i have excellent business , as you see . and i know some thing more than to eat my soup . since i know do to prepare it , i did learn that it must give to the first . to second , and to the third service , by dishes that want to join . and yet some thing more ; because we does pretend make a feast at four services without to account the dessert .
fair , i have seen worse ... do you smoke ? and the stain noted on your right posterior phalanx by the learned medical examiners ? or twenty to be safe , better taper off to ten , at all events . make twenty the limit , how about the booze ? so they all say . the answer is almost part of the liturgy .
when marrying a second time refrain from asking your friends what they think about it . remember that they all think you are a fool . a man 's kisses are first reverent . then rapturous , then tender , then casual , and last -- charitable , the hardest thing in life is to discover the exact geographical location of a man 's grouch . whether it is in his tooth , his vanity or his digestion .
miss lyall effaced herself on the front seat of the motor . like a mouse hiding in a corner . after lady ambermere had got in , and the footman mounted onto the box . at that moment peppino with his bag of bulbs . a little out of breath , squeezed his way between two cabs by the side of the motor .
and with that barney left me overwhelmed , subsequently i gave him the ten dollar which i think his story is worth . but i must confess that i am in a dilemma , after what i have said about my supernatural guests . i can not discharge barney for lying , but i will be blest if i can quite believe that his story is accurate in every respect . if there should happen to be among the readers of this tale any who have made a sufficiently close study of the habits of hired men and ghosts to be able to shed any light upon the situation . nothing would please me more than to hear from them .
in adrianople and the neighboring cities , the women have public baths . which are a part of their religion and of their amusement . and a bride , the first time she appears there . after her marriage , is received in a particular manner , the matrons and widows being seated round the room . the virgins immediately put themselves into the original state of eve .
however resolutely he might hold himself aloof from the social life of his restaurant acquaintances . he was not minded to hide his artistic performances from their inquiring gaze . every evening , or nearly every evening , at about seven o'clock . he would make his appearance , sit himself down at his accustomed table . throw a bulky black portfolio on to the chair opposite him .
with a jaunty , if somewhat unsteady , step , he climbed the stairs to the floor above . and made his way down the corridor to sir [male] 's room . he switched on the light , and went to the dressing table , the drawer was locked . but in his present mood spennie , like love . laughed at locksmiths , he grasped the handle .
by three o'clock the fete was in full swing , every stable in barton bridge was full . and the high street presented a curious appearance , with its rows of horseless carriages . carts , and traps , the coach houses and available sheds had all been utilised to give shelter to the scores of horses . the members of the committee , wearing big dark blue rosettes . smiled largely their satisfaction , they knew that reporters were present from the blue ribbon news and the pure water world .
we took the train at sydney at about four in the afternoon . it was [location] in one way . for we had a most rational sleeping car . also the car was clean and fine and new -- nothing about it to suggest the rolling stock of the continent of [location] . but our baggage was weighed , and extra weight charged for , that was [organization] .
the troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called my lady . and your highness , like the rest , it is annoying and difficult to scour around after hogs , in armor . there was one small countess , with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair on her back . that was the devil for perversity , she gave me a race of an hour . over all sorts of country , and then we were right where we had started from .
to the waves , at other times she would tell it to the grass or even to a stick of cordwood or a ton of coal , and [female] ? she , too , cherished beneath her stomacher a miniature of [female] the gimlet . she had it of a travelling chapman in whose pack she had discovered it . and had paid its price in pearls , how had she known that he it was . that is , that it was he ? because of the coat of arms emblazoned beneath the miniature .
there are a great many pleasures to which we may treat ourselves very economically if we go at it right . in this way we can , at a slight expense . have those comforts , and even luxuries , for which we should otherwise pay a great price . rugs may be made of coffee sacking or turkish gunny rest sacks . inlaid with rich designs in red yarn .
next day i went up to the telephone office and found that the king had passed through two towns that were on the line . i spotted his progress on the succeeding day in the same way . i kept these matters to myself , the third day 's reports showed that if he kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon . there was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming ; there seemed to be no preparations making to receive him in state . a strange thing , truly , only one thing could explain this : that other magician had been cutting under me , sure .
and this is what the brighteners of cricket are doing , they are inventing a new game . a game which those of [location] who love cricket have not the least desire to watch . if anybody says that he finds lord 's or the oval boring . i shall not be at all surprised ; the only thing that would surprise me would be to hear that he found it more boring than i find epsom or newmarket . cricket is not to everybody 's taste .
and , most of all , he felt grateful to [male] , firby smith , in the course of his address . had not omitted to lay stress on the importance of [male] 's intervention . but for [male] , he gave him to understand . he , [male] , would have been prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law . [male] came away with a confused picture in his mind of a horde of furious prefects bent on his slaughter .
but i am inclined to think a good share of it should be attributed to the inborn and ingrown british faculty for letting other folks be . only one untoward incident occurred : the inevitable militant lady broke through the lines as the imperial carriage passed and threw a votes for women handbill into his majesty 's lap . she was removed thence by the police with the skill and dexterity of long practice . the police were competently on the job , they always are . which brings me round to the subject of the [location] [male] and leads me to venture the assertion that individually and collectively .
along the shores of the pond are grouped tribes of indians from [location] . they live in their primitive huts and tents . and there we see their rude boats and canoes . [location] contributes a council house and a bark lodge once used by the once powerful iroquois confederation . and , poor things , where be they now ? passed away , their canoes have gone down the stream of time .
so he rang and managed to make the servant understand that he wished to see the landlady . the landlady had always shown a great admiration for the manly , not to say gigantic charms of the senator . upon him she bestowed her brightest smile . and the quick flush on her face and heaving breast told that the senator had made wild work with her too susceptible heart . she arrayed herself , therefore , in her brightest and her best charms .
this is the general course of all fellow commoners ; i will not say any thing of a worser sort . which are many times amongst them ; who run in the mornings to strong water shops . and in the afternoon to taverns ; where they so disguise themselves . that one must be ashamed for honest people who are in the shop , or standing upon the flore . that sees them either come in a dores or down from their chambers .
she came over in our ship second class . and had never been in [location] before , i recollect a similar instance in [location] , [location] . i was returning from government house . where i had been taken by the mayor to sign the visitors book , and as we were returning in the electric car i sat opposite a fine .
all of a sudden i hears the dad blamedest blim blamming behind me . i turns round quick and here comes the [location] paid fire department going to a fire . the biggest fire engine ever i sees goes scooting by , tearing the road wide open and making a most awful racket . right behind comes the hook and ladder wagon with the firemen hanging onto both sides of it . trying to stick fast and put their rubber coats on at the same time .
there was a young lady of wales , who caught a large fish without scales . when she lifted her hook . she exclaimed , `` only look , '' that ecstatic young lady of wales . there was an old person of cheadle , was put in the stocks by the beadle . for stealing some pigs , some coats , and some wigs .
some hunters , who are madly and passionately devoted to the sport , leap their horses over fences . moats , donjon keeps , hedges and currant bushes with utter sang froid and the wild . unfettered toot ongsomble of a brass band . it is one of the most spirited and touchful of sights to see a young fox hunter going home through the gloaming with a full cry in one hand and his pancreas in the other . some like to be in at the death , as it is called , and it is certainly a laudable ambition .
he said a friend of his , the ghost of a man who had killed a water rate collector . used to haunt a house in long acre , where they kept fowls in the cellar . and every time a policeman went by and flashed his bull's eye down the grating , the old cock there would fancy it was the sun . and start crowing like mad ; when , of course , the poor ghost had to dissolve . and it would , in consequence , get back home sometimes as early as one o'clock in the morning .
mr pecksniff 's horse being regarded in the light of a sacred animal . only to be driven by him , the chief priest of that temple . or by some person distinctly nominated for the time being to that high office by himself . the two young men agreed to walk to salisbury ; and so , when the time came . they set off on foot ; which was , after all , a better mode of travelling than in the gig .
the `` jeune hardie '' at last passed beyond the ice in the latitude of jean mayer island . about the 25th of june she met ships going northward for seals and whales . she had been nearly a month emerging from the polar sea . on the 16th of august she came in view of dunkirk . she had been signalled by the look out , and the whole population flocked to the jetty .
and then , was it true ? was it the fact that mr maguire was ill treating some other woman in order that he might get her money ? in all her misery she remembered that mrs stumfold would not commit herself to any such direct assertion . and she remembered also that mrs stumfold had especially insisted on her own part of the grievance . on the fact that the suitable young lady had been met by mr maguire in her drawing room . as to mr maguire himself , she could reconcile herself to the loss of him .
and certainly [female] was not without qualms as he knocked at the door . and went in in response to the hoarse roar from the other side of it . it was not according to his complicated , yet intelligible code of morality to tell lies to save himself . when others were concerned he could suppress the true and suggest the false with a face of brass . [male] remained stonily silent , the rather large grain of truth in what firby smith had said had gone home .
what the result will be , in the present case , i do not know . [organization] and rangoon petroleum company . when i last knew about it , `` still lived , '' they had . or said they had -- bought some land , i have not heard of their receiving any oil raised from their own wells . they have sent off a monstrous quantity of circulars .
in the spreading there is at least ground for suspicion that here and there authentic enthusiasm has worn a bit thin . it is no more than a suspicion , for [organization] is a skillful writer who can set an emotion to galloping without showing the whip . only when he comes to describe a baseball game is the [location] reader prepared to assert roundly that [organization] is merely parading an enthusiasm which he does not feel . we could not escape the impression that the english author felt that a baseball game was the most primitive thing [location] had to offer and that he was in duty bound to enthuse over this exhibition of human nature in the raw . we have seen many englishmen at baseball games .
the trees , the drive , the turf . the sky , the birds , the house . the automobile , and jarvis , the stuffed chauffeur . leaped together for an instant in one whirling , dancing mass of which i was the centre . and then , out of the chaos , as it separated itself once more into its component parts .
he piloted [location] through one picturesque street after another . and in due course deposited [location] where we belonged . he charged nothing for his map . and but a trifle for his services : so the reverend doubled it . the little chap received the money with a beaming applause in his eye which plainly said .
looking back , now , i see pretty vividly three quite distinct pictures , one of them . the rich , red interior of the billiard room , with the brilliant green square in the center on which the gay balls are rolling . and bent over it his luminous white figure in the instant of play . then there is the long lighted drawing room , with the same figure stretched on a couch in the corner . drowsily smoking while the rich organ tones summon for him scenes and faces which the others do not see .
during this time , tomas pedro pretended to have had fifty crowns sent to him from seville . and taking them out of his pocket , he presented them to the innkeeper . along with a fictitious letter from his master , it was nothing to the landlord whether the letter was genuine or not . so he gave himself no trouble to authenticate it . but he received the fifty good gold crowns with great glee .
it guyed its poor victim , baited him . worried him , as dogs do with a cornered cat . the victim answered back with defiances and challenges which included everybody . and which only gave the sport new spirit and variety . but when he changed his tactics and began to single out individuals and invite them by name .
secondly , that what is commonly called love , namely , the desire of satisfying a voracious appetite with a certain quantity of delicate white human flesh . is by no means that passion for which i here contend . this is indeed more properly hunger ; and as no glutton is ashamed to apply the word love to his appetite . and to say he loves such and such dishes ; so may the lover of this kind . with equal propriety , say , he hungers after such and such women .
isabella could only kiss [male] 's hand again and again . and tell him in a voice broken by her tears . that she accepted him as hers . and gave herself to him as his slave . [female] kissed her disfigured face , which he had never ventured to kiss in its beauty .
but now she was to be taken into favor again , and she represented to me that we could go back and get her money . and that i could establish myself there as well as anywhere ; we could live well and happily among her friends and old associations . these things were dinged in my ears day after day . till i was sick of the very sound , i could see that she was bound . or , as the dutch doctor would have said , `` bewitched '' to go back .
after the virgins had sung a marriage song . the company partook of a repast . the most magnificent the parties could afford ; after which they began a dance . the men round the bridegroom , the women round the bride . they pretended that this dance was of divine institution and an essential part of the ceremony .
the only individual throughout [location] who ever dreams of taking liberties with the law is the german student . and he only to a certain well defined point , by custom . certain privileges are permitted to him , but even these are strictly limited and clearly understood . for instance , the german student may get drunk and fall asleep in the gutter with no other penalty than that of having the next morning to tip the policeman who has found him and brought him home . but for this purpose he must choose the gutters of side streets .
such bargaining is intensely distasteful to me , when the marquis found all his offers declined with a politeness which left no opening for anger on his part . he endeavoured to induce me to take up the case on a commission contingent upon my recovery of the gems . and as i had declined this for the twentieth time , darkness had come on . and the gong rang for dinner . i dined alone in the salle a manger .
george was gazing over the balcony when the voice spoke behind him . and the muscles of his back stiffened as he recognized its genial note . this was one of the things he had prepared himself for . but , now that it had happened , he felt a wave of stage fright such as he had only once experienced before in his life . on the occasion when he had been young enough and inexperienced enough to take a curtain call on a first night .
[female] hurried off to take his place in the ranks . getting to camp at the end of the summer term is always a nuisance . aldershot seems a long way from everywhere , and the trains take their time over the journey . then , again , the heat always happens to be particularly oppressive on that day . snow may have fallen on the day before , but directly one sets out for camp .
there were now one band upstairs and five in the high street . as near to the shop as they could cluster , and a seventh approaching . all were striving to interpret moody and [location] as moody and [location] had never been interpreted before . the inspector walked out on to the pavement , and vainly strove to signal to two of his men whose helmets could be seen among the crowd . mr. [male] 's eyes followed the officer .
father o'leary , when in [location] , had a great desire to see [male] . but finding access to the king of misers very difficult . invented a singular plan to gain his object , he sent a message to the miser . to the effect that he had been in the indies . become acquainted with a man of immense wealth named [male] .
and , meantime , my own vegetables are on their way , they are in a soap box with bars across the top . coming by freight , they weigh forty six pounds . including the box , they represent the result of four months arduous toil in sun , wind , and storm . yet it is pleasant to think that i shall be able to feed with them some poor family of refugees during the rigour of the winter .
[female] died , and the struggle recommenced , [female] tried to assert herself . and said that she should go to take care of mrs. [female] . it required all mrs. [female] 's kindness to prevent her . a house was finally taken for her at sawston , and there for three years she lived with irma . continually subject to the refining influences of her late husband 's family .
i did not communicate a word of all this to my son [male] . i told him i was going to new jersey to visit some friends . to look for business , and i would like to have him accompany me , he consented . i hired a horse and carriage , and one bright morning we started . i had no friends to visit , no business to do .
she looked at the queen , who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool . alice rubbed her eyes , and looked again , she could not make out what had happened at all . was she in a shop ? and was that really -- was it really a sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter ? rub as she could , she could make nothing more of it . she was in a little dark shop .
spring returned , and there was much watching of the vanes . and great joy when they pointed easterly , and the ship news now became the most interesting column of the papers . a vessel that had sailed from [location] to [location] on the same day the voltaire departed from [location] had already got in . therefore , the voltaire might be hourly expected , at length she was reported below . and at this period the river delaware suffered much .
at last i was brought to a cell door and the cap was taken off . there were , properly no `` cells '' in this prison -- at least i never saw any . but good sized rooms for two prisoners . not only to live in but to work in , i found myself in a room with a man who was weaving carpets . and i was at once instructed in the art of winding yarn on bobbins for him .
but features of this sort , of course . are familiar wherever a successful occult creed makes its way against the prejudices of the multitude . the really notable part of the whole experience was the marvellous demonstration of occult power which attended the final seance of the society . the true nature of which is still wrapped in mystery , for some weeks it had been rumoured that a very special feat or demonstration of power by mr. [male] was under contemplation . in fact , the rapid spread of swaraj and of nirvana among the members rendered such a feat highly desirable .
when the dissection demanded by the majority of the sect could no longer be delayed . that operation was performed , and it was found that the subject had died of ovarian dropsy . but was -- as she had always maintained herself to be -- a virgin . dr. [female] , who had been a devout believer . but was now undeceived , published a full account of this and all the other circumstances of her death .
[male] laughed and said that he had had enough of being admiral to last him all his life . but when [male] insisted , he said he would see what he could do . all yesterday and today the sea was quite calm . and we could sit on deck , i was glad because . in the cabin where i am , there are three other women .
they had some medicine in their chest . and this man of sad experience showed mark how and when to administer it . and how he could best alleviate the sufferings of [male] . his attentions did not stop there ; for he was backwards and forwards constantly . and rendered mark good service in all his brisk attempts to make their situation more endurable .
for about a week he held a position as cashier in a bank . they discharged the lad because he refused to forge a cheque . for three days he held a conductorship on a broadway surface car . he was dismissed from this business for refusing to steal a nickel . such , reader , is the horrid degradation of business life in [location] .
young bute told me that a friend of his . a well to do young fellow , who lived in piccadilly , had had the whim to make his flat the reproduction of a roman villa . there were of course no fires , the rooms were warmed by hot air from the kitchen . they had a cheerless aspect on a november afternoon . and nobody knew exactly where to sit , light was obtained in the evening from grecian lamps .
i am like a general who has planned out a brilliant attack , and realises that he must fail for want of sufficient troops to carry a position . on the taking of which the whole success of the assault depends . briefly , my position is like this , my name is pretty well known in a small sort of way among editors and the like as that of a man who can turn out fairly good stuff . besides this , i have many influential friends , you see where this brings me ? i am in the middle of my attacking movement , and i have not been beaten back .
he broke off , and then , `` hers too , she 's true as steel . '' i began to busy myself amongst some manuscripts to give [male] time to compose himself . and so an hour passed , at a quarter past four i got up to go out . [male] lay recumbent , it seemed terrible to leave him brooding alone over his misery . meanwhile , eva eversleigh and i became firm friends , of her person i need simply say that it was the most beautiful that nature ever created .
he was uneasy for me , this good old man . but i reassured him by a wave and a smile . the dogs opened in front of me . one or two may have been hurt , but what would you have ? the egg must be broken for the omelette . i could hear the huntsman shouting his congratulations behind me .
and then the strange thing happened , [male] reformed , one might almost say that he reformed with a jerk . it was a parallel case to those sudden conversions at welsh revival meetings . on monday evening he had been at his worst , on the following morning he was a changed man . not even after the original thunderstorm had he been more docile , [male] could not believe that first . the lip , once bitten , was stretched in a smile , she looked for the frown .
the village constable is stout , yet tries short runs to win . they say he 's run more people out than ever he ran in . the watchmaker winds up the side , but fails to time his pulls . by now he must be well supplied with pairs of spectacles . our umpire 's fair ; he says `` not out , ''
this company was formed in 1711 ; its stock was at first about dollar 30,000,000 . subscribed by the public and handed over by the corporators to government to meet certain troublesome public debts . in return , government guaranteed the stockholders a dividend of six per cent. . and gave the company sundry permanent important duties and a monopoly of all trade to the south pacific . or `` south sea , '' this matter went on with fair success as a money enterprise .
[organization] pulled a light coat over his evening dress . and , with an agitation he could hardly explain , walked across the street and entered the palace . the line of royalties had broken by the time he reached the ballroom . and the not over severe etiquette of the greek court left him free . after a bow to those who still waited to receive it , to move about as he pleased .
this remark may , indeed , be the natural exclamation of refined sensibility . in contemplating the various maladies to which a creature of such delicate organs is inevitably exposed . but , if we take a more enlarged survey of human existence . we shall be far from discovering any just reason to arraign the benevolence of its provident and gracious author . if the delicacy of woman must render her familiar with pain and sickness .
there he took up the hod carrying business . went on the stage and set the world laughing . he also entered politics , captured the [location] police force . and , together with his brothers in parliament , rules great [location] and [location] . pear , the man who names most of the [location] busses .
[female] , much impressed , nodded acquiescence , and i took a polite leave of him . the question of lighting is an important one in a room such as mine . and electricity offers a good deal of scope to the ingenious . of this fact i have taken full advantage . i can manipulate the lighting of my room so that any particular spot is bathed in brilliancy .
it is the antithesis of the anglo saxon scheme . but as both the anglo saxon and the teuton are prospering , there must be good in both methods . hitherto , the german has had the blessed fortune to be exceptionally well governed ; if this continue . it will go well with him , when his troubles will begin will be when by any chance something goes wrong with the governing machine . but maybe his method has the advantage of producing a continuous supply of good governors .
`` oh , coronel , you must , '' said hyacinth . but she felt very happy all the same , they rode off the next day to their kingdom . the chancellor had had an exciting week ; for seven successive evenings he had been extremely mysterious and reserved to his wife . but now his business was finished and king merriwig reigned over [organization] and king coronel over the west . let [location] just take a look at belvane 's diary before we move on to the last scene .
this affair was afterwards the subject of much debate between thwackum and square . thwackum held , that this was flying in mr allworthy 's face . who had intended to punish the fellow for his disobedience , he said . in some instances , what the world called charity appeared to him to be opposing the will of the almighty . which had marked some particular persons for destruction ; and that this was in like manner acting in opposition to mr allworthy .
`` well , '' challenged mrs. [female] , as he remained silent . `` i did not say anythink , '' he mumbled . picking up his cap and making for the door , thankful that it was saturday . and that he would be home in time to see his beloved niece . that afternoon [male] arrived home with his pockets bulging .
monsieur jacques breton had nothing better to offer in his defence . and after having repeated the same things half a dozen times over , he was delivered into the iron custody of the turnkey till he should find bail for his appearance at the sessions . a person of very respectable exterior was brought before the magistrate . charged with assaulting the waiter , and destroying the property , of an eating house proprietor in the neighbourhood of covent garden . eating houses , properly so called , are , as is well known to the initiated .
and the worst of all is , that whil'st you are thus busie in contriving . ordering and looking upon things , you are every moment hindered . and taken off from it , with a continual knocking at the dore to sollicite one to deliver all sorts of comfits . another to deliver the ornaments for the brides garland , flowers , and c . a third to be cook , and pastryman , and so many more , which come one after another thundering so at the door .
may i say in conclusion that i do not consider a five cent pen wiper from the top branch of a xmas tree any adequate compensation for the kind of evening you propose . i have the honour to subscribe myself . your obedient servant , i mix a good deal with the millionaires . i like them , i like their faces , i like the way they live . i like the things they eat .
cold blooded murder. -- yesterday , between 12 and one o'clock . in front of this office on second street . [female] , in a manner almost wholly unprovoked , shot [male] . commonly known as [male] , [male] died at two o'clock this morning of his wounds . [male] was not a bad man , but , as his nickname would imply .
they followed the line of the quai . which they had gained on quitting the rue saint honore , where they left athos . d'artagnan went first ; his elbow , his wrist , his shoulder formed three wedges which he knew how to insinuate with skill into the groups . to make them split and separate like firewood , he made use sometimes of the hilt of his sword as an additional help . introducing it between ribs that were too rebellious , making it take the part of a lever or crowbar .
[female] was within two inches of dropping dead at this unwelcome reply . to which she would have rejoined , but that she saw some of the gitanos come into the yard . she rushed from the spot , athirst for vengeance . [male] , like a wise man . determined to get out of her way , for he read in her eyes that she would willingly give herself to him with matrimonial bonds .
to complete every other recommendation , he had almost told her that he loved her . what strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to . was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration . a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion . joined to all the rest , made her think that she must be a little in love with him .
now , however ludicrous all this may appear to some , others , i doubt not . will feel and acknowledge the truth of it ; nay , may , perhaps , think i have not treated the subject with decent solemnity . but surely a man may speak truth with a smiling countenance . in reality , to depreciate a book maliciously , or even wantonly , is at least a very ill natured office . and a morose snarling critic may , i believe , be suspected to be a bad man .
even the most degraded woman can walk our streets unmolested , her sex and her weakness being her sufficient protection . she will encounter less polish than she would in the old world . but she will run across enough humanity to make up for it . the music of a donkey awoke [location] early in the morning . and we rose up and made ready for a pretty formidable walk , to [location] .
at present she neither acquitted nor condemned him ; she did not pass judgment . at the moment when she was about to judge him her cousin 's voice had intervened . and , ever since , it was miss [female] who had dominated ; miss [female] who . even now , could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall . miss [female] , who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent , she had worked like a great artist .
later in the evening , the twins , their spirits restored . stole to the top of the stairs and peered down at the whirling couples . exultant not to be among them , mr. [male] was standing just below , and he glanced up . as if he might have been listening , his face brightened , `` may i come up ? '' he signaled , and mounted two steps at a time .
emma did not want to be classed with the mrs. eltons . the mrs. [female] , and the mrs. [female] . who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself . she submitted , therefore , and only questioned miss bates farther as to her niece 's appetite and diet . which she longed to be able to assist , on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy .
but he had got tired about sundown , and come in , and leaned up against my lap . and asked me about 88 questions about his ma and the city . he had never forgot what his uncle josiah had read about it . and he could not seem to talk enough about it , and he wus jest a askin me this , -- and it beats all , how many times he had tackled me on this very subject .
the gates on the elevated trains get shet rather sudden sometimes , and once they shet in a part of a man . i was told , and left the rest of him on the outside . so that after a while he fell off over the trestle . because there was more of him on the outside than on the inside , and he did not seem to balance somehow . it was rare sport for the guards to watch the man scraping along the side of the road and sweeping off the right of way .
having conglomerated , [male] saunders offered him his horse again . telling him he had `` mounted it by accident , '' and it ran away with him ; that he wished it at the dooce . almost , for taking him so far from home ; and that he was come to town for the sole purpose of advertising in the noosepapers for its owner . when he had told the astonished mr. [male] all this , he dismounted .
moreover , mr. [organization] had had to attend that evening . at the mausoleum club , a meeting of the trustees of the church ofasaph . and he had come home at eleven o'clock . as he always did after diocesan work of this sort . quite used up ; in fact , so fatigued that he had gone upstairs to his own suite of rooms sideways .
he pushed his chair back from his desk and stood up . a chunky little man with bright blue eyes and large hands . he paced to the window and looked out at [location] . and then he came back to the desk , a persistent office rumor held that he had become head of the [organization] purely because he happened to have an initial j in his name . but in his case the j stood for jeremiah .
what temptation can a man of my turn and temperament have . to live in a place where every corner teems with fresh objects of detestation and disgust ? what kind of taste and organs must those people have . who really prefer the adulterate enjoyments of the town to the genuine pleasures of a country retreat ? most people , i know , are originally seduced by vanity .
the last [female] saw was a group scene with the stout young man in the middle of it . the hat had been popped up into the infield , where it had been caught by the messenger boy . the stout young man was bending over it and stroking it with soothing fingers . it was too far off for anything to be audible , but he seemed to [male] to be murmuring words of endearment to it . then , placing it on his head , he darted out into the road and [male] saw him no more .
[male] toyed with his short mustache , he was not quite equal to a direct answer on the spur of the moment . he had a faith in his star . something would turn up , something always had turned up in the old days . and doubtless , with the march of civilization . opportunities had multiplied , somewhere behind those tall buildings the goddess of luck awaited him .
[female] was the daughter of a farmer living near [location] . [female] , and was a handsome girl about twenty years of age . she was going , she told me . to visit some friends in bennington , and would be there about a month . during which time , if i was in that vicinity .
psmith went to the bathroom to wash his hands again . with the feeling that he had done a good day 's work . the most massive minds are apt to forget things at times . the most adroit plotters make their little mistakes , psmith was no exception to the rule . he made the mistake of not telling [male] of the afternoon 's happenings .
i had a few of king [male] 's shillings . as smooth as glass , in my pocket ; and foreseeing they would be of use in the illustration of my hypothesis . i had got them into my hand when i had proceeded so far . - see , monsieur le count , said i . rising up , and laying them before him upon the table .
it suddenly came home to him that not only did he not know her address . but he was ignorant of her name . [male] had called the man with the revolver `` boss '' throughout . only that and nothing more , except that he was a police captain . [male] knew as little about the man as he had before their meeting .
being acquitted , he was at once tried again for an assault and battery on his daughter by the aforesaid whippings . and on this charge he was found guilty and sent to the county jail for three months . in april , 1835 , the trial for murder was just before . the prophet having lain in prison since his apprehension for murder in the preceding autumn . mr. [male] 's delusion had pretty much disappeared by the end of the summer of 1834 .
but of literary fame he could never have dreamed , the chief ambition . the `` permanent ambition '' -- of every [male] boy was to be a pilot . the pilot in his splendid glass perch with his supreme power and princely salary was to them the noblest of all human creatures . an elder [male] boy was already a pilot . and when he came home , as he did now and then , his person seemed almost too sacred to touch .
the lord chancellor , oh , if he did but know , streph . if he did but know what ? iol , no matter ! the lord chancellor has no power over you . remember you are half a fairy , you can defy him . down to the waist , streph , yes , but from the waist downwards he can commit me to prison for years !
he opened the suitcase , using -- oddly enough a key from his own bunch of keys . he found a night shirt and put it on , to his surprise it fitted him exactly . which was odd , for mr. [male] was an unusually tall and thin man . without wasting time , he climbed into the cot and closed his eyes . mr. [male] also retired , philo [male] .
26 , when rablais the greatest drole in [male] , lay on his death bed , he could not help jesting at the very last moment . for having received the extreme unction , a friend coming to see him . said , he hoped he was prepared for the next world . yes , yes , reply would rablais , i am ready for my journey now . they have just greased my boots , 27 , [male] the ivth .
young farnsworth , who kept the crockery store . told him the news , and presently jake hibbard . the worst `` shyster '' in the village , shuffled in -- noticeable anywhere for his suit of rusty black . his empty sleeve pinned to his coat , the green patch over his eye . and his tobacco stained lips , he confirmed the report .
said the disgusted voice of [male] from the shadows . `` they have beaten it , '' the circle of lamplight became as if by mutual consent a general rendezvous . three grey clad policemen , tough , clean shaven men with keen eyes and square jaws . stood there , revolver in one hand , night stick in the other , psmith , hatless and dusty , joined them . [male] and the kid , the latter bleeding freely from his left ear .
it was borne in upon me , as she began to do so . that she appeared from the very beginning to have been extremely confident that that essential part of her plans . my consent to the scheme , could be relied upon as something of a certainty . women have these intuitions , looking back , i think i can fix the point at which this insane venture i had undertaken ceased to be a distorted dream . from which i vaguely hoped that i might shortly waken , and took shape as a reality of the immediate future .
there is cribbing to gain marks , and there is cribbing to save trouble or avoid punishment . the average boy , who is in the main an honest individual , holds aloof from the former practice because he feels that it is unsportsmanlike . rather like stealing , in fact ; but he usually acquiesces without a struggle in the conveniences offered by the second . for instance , he refrains from furtively copying from his neighbour . for he regards that as the meanest kind of brain sucking .
whenever a woman begins to talk of anything , she is talking to . of , or at a man , the worst man hesitates when choosing a mother for his children . and hesitating , he is lost , women always excel men in that sort of wisdom which comes from experience . to be a woman is in itself a terrible experience . no man is ever too old to look at a woman , and no woman is ever too fat to hope that he will look .
the natives traveled third class , and at marvelously cheap rates . they were packed and crammed into cars that held each about fifty . and it was said that often a brahmin of the highest caste was thus brought into personal touch . and consequent defilement , with persons of the lowest castes . no doubt a very shocking thing if a body could understand it and properly appreciate it .
besides , it would make the government the laughing stock of the world if they sold a case of jewels and immediately placed the buyer in custody when they themselves had handed over his goods to him . ridicule kills in [male] . a breath of laughter may blow a government out of existence in [location] much more effectually than will a whiff of cannon smoke . my duty then was to give the government full warning . and never lose sight of my man until he was clear of [male] .
it was so entirely unexpected , he clutched mr. [male] steamer trunk in his emotion . all his resolutions to be cold and distant were swept away , he had the feeling that in a friendless universe here was somebody who was fond of him and glad to see him . a smile of such importance demands analysis . and in this case repays it ; for many things lay behind this smile of joan valentine 's on the platform of market blandings station .
it was soon manifest to the eyes of those who understood such things . that the negro soldiers orphan bazaar was to be a success . and therefore there was no difficulty whatsoever in putting the custody of the stalls into the hands of proper persons . the difficulty consisted in rejecting offers from persons who undoubtedly were quite proper for such an occasion . there came to be interest made for permission to serve , and boastings were heard of unparalleled success in the bazaar line .
as he shouldered his way towards the gate he was aware of these two men . one on either side of him , he looked at them fondly . trying to make up his mind which of them he liked best . it was sad to think that they must soon go out of his life again for ever . he came to a sudden resolution , he would postpone the parting .
he had told the pattersons a little about the story . it was pretty pathetic in spots , he said . but it all came right in the end , and there were some good western scenes . when the pattersons said he must be very good in it . he found himself unable to achieve the light fashion of denial and protestation that would have become him .
his fingers were as cold as ice , and his lips burned like fire . but [location] did not falter , as he led her across the dusky room . on the faded green tapestry were broidered little huntsmen , they blew their tasselled horns and with their tiny hands waved to her to go back . `` go back , little [location] , '' they cried , `` go back , '' but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly . and she shut her eyes against them .
there did not seem much to be done , i just lit a cigarette and sat there . he did not want to talk , presently he went out , i stood at the window of our upper smoking room . which looks out on to piccadilly , and watched him , he walked slowly along for a few yards . stopped , then walked on again , and finally turned into a jeweller 's , which was an instance of what i meant when i said that deep down in him there was a certain stratum of sense . it was from now on that i began to be really interested in this problem of [male] 's married life .
chapter x -- wherein the history begins to draw towards a conclusion . chapter xi -- the history draws nearer to a conclusion . chapter the last -- in which the history is concluded , notwithstanding your constant refusal . when i have asked leave to prefix your name to this dedication . i must still insist on my right to desire your protection of this work .
the [female] was gaily decorated with flags and coloured paper . and the eye was further refreshed by the spectacle of a mixed drove of boys . parents , and what not , the former running a good deal to shiny faces and eton collars . the latter stressing the black satin note rather when female , and looking as if their coats were too tight , if male . and presently there was some applause -- sporadic , [female] has since told me it was .
break was a more uncertain quantity , sometimes he could get it at the expense of pitch . sometimes at the expense of pace , some days he could get all three . and then he was an uncommonly bad man to face on anything but a plumb wicket . running he had acquired in a similar manner , he had nothing approaching style . but he had twice won the mile and half mile at the sports off elegant runners .
the result was that a letter was written by the lawyer to mr maguire . telling mr maguire that any further communication should be made to him . and also making a slight suggestion as to the pains and penalties which are incurred in the matter of a libel . mr maguire had dated his letter from littlebath . and there the answer reached him , he had returned thither .
i never hearn a word from her , and i am afraid she died [female] i had slighted her , the next morning bright and early we went aboard the ship that wuz to take [location] home . it wuz a fair day ; the fog dispersed and the sun shone out with promise and the waves talked to me of home , sweet home . it wuz a cold lowerin day when the good ship bore [location] into [location] harbor . the gray clouds hung low some as if they wuz a sombry canopy ready to cover up sunthin ' .
he managed , however , to tell several of his best on this occasion , as the gallant general will tell them again . and i trust many times , i shall not publish them here , mine are not worth repeating . as i said , i felt at the moment something like a well-known literary celebrity distinguished for his capital scotch tales and his conversational brevity . he was invited to meet the late [male] , who had expressed such a strong desire to make his acquaintance that he agreed to dine at the reform club ( which he had not done for a considerable time ) . and this was only arranged by their giving him the same waiter and allowing him to sit at the same table he was in the habit of having at lunch every day .
even when the stage was being entirely reset , one heard no noise . during the whole time that `` king lear '' was playing the curtain was never down two minutes at any one time . the orchestra played until the curtain was ready to go up for the first time . then they departed for the evening , where the stage waits never reach two minutes there is no occasion for music .
it may look queer , but so does the whole picture . you can not tell ; the big window may open from a room that needs a big window . i am not going to stultify myself by making things wrong about which i know none of the facts . who am i that i should condemn a man for looking through the large end of a telescope ? personally , i like to look through the large end of a telescope .
she had thirty six peach trees in her walled garden . as well as four hot houses in which trees could be forced , so that she was able to eat peaches practically the whole year round . in 1916 she ate 4200 peaches , and sent the stones to the government . in 1917 the military authorities called up three of her gardeners , and what with this and the fact that it was a bad year for wall fruit . she only managed to eat 2900 peaches during that crucial period of the national destinies .
they drew a line on the path with their feet to mark paul 's starting point . and went on to the next lamp , after a moment or two of anxious waiting he heard coggs shout . all in one breath , `` one two three off , '' and the sound of scampering feet followed immediately . it was a most exciting and hotly contested race , paul saw them for one brief moment in the lamplight . he saw chawner scudding down the path like some great camel .
and now , on a fine midsummer night , thinner than of old , and paler . with a scar across his left temple , and a languor of body which he was beginning to find irksome because of the revived activity of the lately clouded and heavy brain . brierly sat in a pleasant upper room of a certain hospitable suburban villa . the only south he had known since they bore him away from the myers home , and whirled him away from the city on a suburban train .
constable riggs deposed that on the evening of the eleventh instant while he was on his beat . prisoner accosted him and , after offering to fight him for fourpence . drew off his right boot and threw it at his head . accused , questioned by the magistrate , admitted the charge and expressed regret . pleading that he had had words with his young woman .
the queen commanded them to approach her . [female] raised her eyes to look at persons who she heard were spaniards . and , above all , from cadiz , longing to know if perchance they were acquainted with her parents . her mother first encountered her gaze . and as she looked attentively at her , there rose on her mind some shadowy confused reminiscences that seemed to intimate she had seen that face before .
[female] -- any woman who is so unreasonable as not to return a man 's affections . flirt -- any woman , over whom a man has insisted on making a fool of himself . kitten -- any woman under sixty for whom a man feels a temporary tenderness . queen -- a pretty woman whom a man has not yet kissed , `` ideal '' the particular woman , to whom a man happens to be making love , clinging vine .
but in connection with this distribution i have laid myself open to another potential mistake . in speaking of a sweeping redistribution , i speak of decision in the aim . not necessarily of abruptness in the means , it is not at all too late to restore an approximately rational state of english possessions without any mere confiscation . a policy of buying out landlordism , steadily adopted in england as it has already been adopted in [location] ( notably in mr. [location] 's wise and fruitful act ) . would in a very short time release the lower end of the see saw and make the whole plank swing more level .
was that no part of the house but the first floor was attached to the alarm . this was simply idiotic ; one might as well have no armor on at all in battle as to have it only on his legs . the expert now put the whole second story on the alarm . charged three hundred dollar for it , and went his way . by and by , one night , i found a burglar in the third story .
when the marquis had said this , he returned his sword into its scabbard . made a bow to the guardians of it . and , with his wife and daughter , and his two sons following him . walk would out , i found no difficulty in getting admittance to monsieur le count [male] b . the set of shakespeares was laid upon the table .
dennis inquired where the prisoners were , overdale was unable to answer . but at last expressed it as his opinion that the persons who were standing about them must `` be the malefactors . '' dennis said he never could satisfactorily account for the jurors being tried . and sent out of the room in charge of officers . but he had too much confidence in the extensive knowledge and vast intelligence of overdale .
`` your daughters are well ? '' said old martin , laying down his hat and stick . mr pecksniff endeavoured to conceal his agitation as a father when he answered yes , they were . they were good girls , he said , very good . he would not venture to recommend mr chuzzlewit to take the easy chair . or to keep out of the draught from the door , if he made any such suggestion .
and you , m^ { rs } , bride , who look so prettily . with such a smirking countenance ; be you merry , you are the bride . yea the bride that occasions all this tripping and dansing . now you shall have a husband too , a protector . who will hug and imbrace you , and somtimes tumble and rumble you .
they had a most noble good time , you never saw such people . those banks of beautiful ladies , shining in their barbaric splendors . would see a knight sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting . and instead of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a better view . only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief , and look ostentatiously broken hearted , and then you could lay two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was afraid the public had not found it out .
that poor boy was myself , but i can not close this research without saying that the boys alone can not claim the glory in [location] . the girls are entitled to recognition , permit me , therefore , to present the birthplace of [female] . i do not speak of it because i desire to treat the matter lightly . but to call attention to little [location] 's sagacity in selecting the same style of birthplace as that chosen by other presidential candidates . she very truly said in the course of a conversation with the writer .
removal. -- desiring a more central location for transacting my business . i have removed my office to no , 17 merchants exchange . ', where ? one says to west troy , [location] ; another to patterson , [location] . another to [location] , [location] ; another , to salem , [location] , and so on ! it is a new thing to find how central all those places are .
ergo , in marrying [female] , she was guilty of bigamy . because she was the wife of another man at the time . which is all very well as far as it goes -- but then , do not you see . she had no other husband when she married [female] . and consequently she was not guilty of bigamy , now , according to this view of the case .
[female] , too , loved to hear the girl talk of her father 's estates . of the diamond hilted sword that the saladin had given , or had lent , to her ancestor hundreds of years ago . her description of her father , the old earl . touched something romantic in [male] 's generous heart . he was never tired of asking how old he was , was he robust .
the scene was rehearsed again , to baird 's satisfaction , and the cameras ground . merton gill gave the best that was in him . his glad look at first beholding the old lady , the yearning of his eyes when his arms opened to enfold her . the tenderness of his embrace as he murmured soothing words . the lingering touch of his hand as he left her .
your husband i abhor . [male] i despise , and i am secure of never seeing either again . have i not reason to rejoice ? mainwaring is more devoted to me than ever . and were we at liberty , i doubt if i could resist even matrimony offered by him . this event , if his wife live with you .
riding has caused my appearance in a police court . but not as a member of the two pins club , in october . 1895 , i was returning from my usual ride before breakfast . accompanied by my little daughter ; we turned into the terrace in which we live . and our horses cantered up the hill about 120 yards .
i have given you a sketch of the man . whom the other day i went to visit -- at the gate we found a great number of powdered lacquies . but no civility -- after we had sat a considerable time in the coach . we were told , that mr baynard had rode out , and that his lady was dressing . but we were introduced to a parlour , so very fine and delicate , that in all appearance it was designed to be seen only , not inhabited .
was she to go and see a woman who had had a baby under such circumstances ? or was her own eldest son , the very , very marquis of brotherton . to be there with his wife , and was she not to go and see them ? through it all her indignation against her son had not been hot as had been theirs against their brother . he was her eldest son .
i remained in maine nearly two years , hardly ever going out of the state . except occasionally to [location] on business , making [female] my residence and headquarters . i practiced in [location] and in nearly all the towns and cities in the eastern part of the state . during all this time , i behaved myself , in all respects better than i had ever before done in any period of my life . i began to look upon myself as a reformed man .
in the final analysis , and stripping aside the lesser contributory causes . i maintain there were just two outstanding reasons why this country went dry after the fashion in which it did go dry . one reason was the distiller ; the other was the brewer . and for the woes of either or both i , for one , decline to shed a single tear . how a fellow does run on when he gets on the subject which is uppermost in the minds of the [location] people this year !
ceasing eventually , she waited for him to begin ; and he did not begin . not , that is to say , in the sense the word conveyed to [male] . he spoke briefly of college . still more briefly of [location] -- which city he appeared to regard with a distaste that made lot 's attitude towards the cities of the plain almost kindly by comparison . then , as if he had fulfilled the demands of the most exacting inquisitor in the matter of personal reminiscence .
to make himself more secure he locked that door . then , turning up the incandescent light , he proceeded to look about him . mr. [male] 's dining room repaid inspection . there were the remains of supper on the table . [male] cut himself some cheese and took some biscuits from the box .
all , a bat could see he could not be a chum of ours if he chuckled , all . what folly fell , to go and tell our plot to any one 's detective ! pack up at once and off we go , unless we are anxious to exhibit our fairy forms all in a row . strung up upon the castle gibbet , about a century since , the code of the duello to sudden death for want of breath sent many a strapping fellow . the then presiding prince , he passed an act .
ed , note : the editor hopes to remove this name before the next edition . its insertion is entirely due to the machinations of book reviewers . who claim miss corelli 's books have fallen into the `` was '' class . the editor never contradicts a book reviewer . coxey , general , leader of the only non militant army in the world which did not take up collections or give away christmas dinners . critic , dramatic , a notorious prevaricator who tells the world to see all the shows .
you re a frightful character from all accounts. [female] could not think of anything to say that was not rude , so said nothing . [male] 's soul began to tie itself into knots again . he was just at the age when one is most sensitive to patronage and most resentful of it . [male] had a vague idea of sacrificing his career to the momentary pleasure of flinging a chair at the head of the house .
those windows , in a double row , with the gallery between . how regularly i counted the small panes , always forgetting the number , to make the same weary task necessary every sunday ! the singing seats , projecting from the central portion of the gallery . furnished me with another hebdomadal study . in large gilt letters of antique awkwardness .
that was upon a morning when the other boys were in school . georgie having found himself indisposed until about ten o'clock . when he was able to take nourishment and subsequently to interest himself in this rather private errand . he climbed the [male] alley fence . and , having made a modest investigation of the exterior of the shack .
there , visible , was the end of the pastoral age , she descended from the fence with pronounced inelegance . and , approaching the old double doors of the `` carriage house , '' which were open . paused to listen , sounds from above assured her that the editors were editing . or at least that they could be found at their place of business . therefore , she ascended the cobwebby stairway .
the two men , so different in many ways , always had the fondest admiration for each other . each recognized in the other great courage , humanity , and sympathy . clemens would gladly have remained in hartford that winter . twichell presented him to many congenial people . including [male] , [male] stowe .
that kind of retort would sometimes stop him . but not always , he was especially dangerous if he was found with a newspaper in his hand . because that meant that some item of foreign intelligence had gone to his brain . not that i should have objected to yarner describing his travels , any man who has bought a ticket round the world and paid for it . is entitled to that , but it was his manner of discussion that i considered unpermissible .
as i write these lines , i learn with ill concealed pleasure that he is still a corpse . an awful dispensation of providence , in the shape of a large . wilted cucumber , laid hold upon his vitals and cursed him with an inward pain . he has since had the opportunity , by actual personal observation . to see whether the statements by me relating to astronomy were true , his last words were .
he calls to them to stop , quite gently and politely at first , then : `` hi ! [male] , can '' t you hear ? not quite so affably this time , after that he springs up . and dances about , and roars himself red in the face . and curses everything he knows . and the small boys on the bank stop and jeer at him .
on one occasion the king , suddenly recollecting he had not celebrated his birthday for several weeks . announced a royal festival on a most elaborate scale . the cream puff crop was an unusually large one , and the bushes were hanging full of the delicious ripe puffs . which were highly prized by the people of mo , so all the maidens got out their best dresses and brightest ribbons . and the young men carefully brushed their hair and [male] their boots .
she has , however , previous to his taking her hands , put one arm and head through the frame she uses . so that of course he does not feel it when she passes his hand down one side of her neck and over one of her arms . as it is under that arm , her husband pulls the tambourine from under the investigator 's elbow . then the medium gets her head back through the frame . leaving it on her arm .
doubtless there was a sentry on guard at the gate when the volcano belched forth . and the skin of the earth flinched and shivered and split asunder . but he did not remain for the finish , he said to himself that this was no place for a minister 's son . and so he girded up his loins and he went away from there . wherever we went i was constantly on the outlook for a kind of tourist who had been described to me frequently and at great length by more seasoned travelers .
the marchioness remembered how sir [male] had told her . before popenjoy was born , that all carriage exercise was bad . and why should she go to the deanery ? who could say whether the dean would let her come away again ? what a feather it would be in the dean 's cap if the next popenjoy were born at the deanery . it was explained to her that in no other way could she see her husband .
my first stick was a malacca , silver at the collar and person horn as to the handle . for weeks it looked beseechingly at me from a shop window . until a lucky birthday tip sent me in after it . we went back to school together that afternoon . and if anything can lighten the cloud which hangs over the last day of holidays .
he broke off a large piece of the island where the raisins and citron were thickest . and commenced to eat it , but after a time he became tired of eating nothing but fruit cake . and longed for something to go with it , but the island did not contain a single thing except the cake of which it was composed . presently prince zingle began to have a pain inside him . he paid no attention to it at first .
there was a little gray in the sky now ; so i stepped into the woods . and laid down for a nap before breakfast , the sun was up so high when i waked that i judged it was after eight o'clock . i laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things . and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied , i could see the sun out at one or two holes . but mostly it was big trees all about , and gloomy in there amongst them .
mrs. mullet belonged to an emotional race , and she kissed clovis . it was nobody 's fault that the rain came down in torrents the next morning . making a picnic a fantastic impossibility , it was also nobody 's fault . but sheer ill luck , that the weather cleared up sufficiently in the afternoon to tempt mr. [male] to make his first essay with the brogue . they did not get as far as the pigs at lockyer 's farm .
you can resolve everything in the world . even a great fortune , into atoms , and the fundamental principles which govern the handling of postage stamps and of millions are exactly the same . they are the common law of business . and the whole practice of commerce is founded on them . they are so simple that a fool can not learn them .
sports weather at [location] was as a rule a [female] but unpleasant solution of mud . hail , and iced rain , these were taken as a matter of course . and the school counted it as something gained when they were spared the usual cutting east wind . this year , however , occurred that invaluable exception which is so useful in proving rules . there was no gale , only a gentle breeze , the sun was positively shining .
ten minutes later agravaine , still dazed , was jogging along to the hills , with the damsel by his side , a dragon , fiery withal . was he absolutely certain that he was capable of handling an argument with a fiery dragon ? he would have given much for a little previous experience of this sort of thing . it was too late now , but he wished he had had the forethought to get [male] to put up a magic prescription for him . rendering him immune to dragon bites , but did dragons bite ?
so the opera proceeded , the singers drew inspiration from the audience . and the two great sextettes were rendered not unworthily , miss abbott fell into the spirit of the thing . she , too , chatted and laughed and applauded and encored , and rejoiced in the existence of beauty . as for [male] , he forgot himself as well as his mission . he was not even an enthusiastic visitor , for he had been in this place always .
`` by desire , '' i rehearsed my first lecture . `` art and artists , '' at the savage club . previous to my giving it in public , in those days the savages smoked their pipe of peace in a long room in the savoy . overlooking the graveyard where so many of their tribe lay at rest . i recollect the reading room at the back looked on to a huge building with mournful black lettering on it .
the [female] 's offense was not alone one of taste but of brutality as well . for we all know that as he said `` you chump , '' he hit his friend violently over the head with a dull , blunt instrument . all this , in addition to the ulster problem . makes the solution of the difficulties of [location] seem insurmountable to many students of international affairs .
wall , what took up josiah 's mind most of anything wuz a house all fitted up from basement to attic with electricity . you come home ( say you come in the evenin and bring company with you ) ; you press a button at the door . the door opens ; touch another button , and the person will be all lighted up . and so with every other room in the house , some of these lights will be rosettes of light let into the wall .
not that anybody did ; nor that anybody seemed to want me there at all . i gathered this from the fact that the first thing that met my eye . after i had succeeded in clawing my way down , was a boot . the air was full of boots , there were sixty men sleeping there . or , as regards the majority , i should say trying to sleep there .
the institution of the legion of honor wells calls `` a scheme for decorating frenchmen with bits of ribbon which was admirably calculated to divert ambitious men from subversive proceedings . '' but these same bits of ribbon and the red and green ones of the croix [female] and the yellow and green of the medaille militaire were later to save [female] from the onrush of the germans . without decorations , without phrases and without the brilliant and effective theatrical oratory of french officers . from marshals to sub lieutenants , [male] would have lost the great war . everybody who saw the french army in action realized that its morale was maintained during the worst days by colored ribbons and florid speeches .
but it was impossible until lately to neglect his sheets of news altogether . lately the capitalist press really has begun to be neglected ; because its bad journalism was overpowering and appalling . lately we have really begun to find out that capitalism can not write , just as it can not fight . or pray , or marry , or make a joke . or do any other stricken human thing , but this discovery has been quite recent .
but this application by [male] , and the enormous swindle which it was instantly evident had been perpetrated on somebody or other . of course waked up a commotion at once , the baron [male] . a deadly enemy of [male] , got hold of it all . and in his overpowering eagerness to ruin his foe , quickly rendered the matter so public that it was out of the question to hush it up . it seems probable that [female] expected that the business would be kept quiet for the sake of the queen .
for nearly two months we continued our experiments on these lines . at times [male] himself . so he told me , would leave money . often considerable sums , within reach of the phantasm . which never failed to remove them during the night , but [male] .
it appeared that m. feriaud did even more than this . posters round the ground advertised the fact that . on receipt of five pounds , he would take up a passenger with him . to date , however , there appeared to have been no rush on the part of the canny inhabitants of lexingham to avail themselves of this chance of a breath of fresh air . m. feriaud , a small man with a chubby and amiable face .
it was a dashed tricky thing , of course . to have to decide on the spur of the moment , i was reading in the paper the other day about those birds who are trying to split the atom . the nub being that they have not the foggiest as to what will happen if they do . it may be all right , on the other hand , it may not be all right . and pretty silly a chap would feel , no doubt , if , having split the atom .
absurd to suppose they really care about halfpence . it must , therefore , be about [location] that they care . and we ought to be grateful to them for the pains they are at to keep [location] guiltless . i do not suggest that mrs. [male] had at any point overcharged the duke . but how was he to know that she had not done so , except by checking the items .
all this was highly agreeable to the two miss pecksniffs , who were in immense request . sitting one on either hand of mr jinkins at the bottom of the table . and who were called upon to take wine with some new admirer every minute . they had hardly ever felt so pleasant , and so full of conversation , in their lives . mercy , in particular , was uncommonly brilliant , and said so many good things in the way of lively repartee that she was looked upon as a prodigy .
we should not care to be the client of a farcical comedy stage lawyer . legal transactions are trying to the nerves under the most favorable circumstances . conducted by a farcical stage lawyer , the business would be too exciting for us . she sits on a table and smokes a cigarette . a cigarette on the stage is always the badge of infamy .
the noble mind may be clouded by adversity , but can not be wholly concealed . for true merit shines by a light of its own . and , glimmering through the rents and crannies of indigence . is perceived , respected , and honored by the generous and the great , a certain man . being deranged in his intellects , was placed by his relations in the mad house of seville .
it fills it , i have seen him again . i have spoken with him , he sat beside the river on his camp stool . how beautiful he looked , sitting on it : how strong he seemed and how frail the little stool on which he sat . before him was the easel and he was painting . i spoke to him , his name -- , how my heart beats as i write it .
( i reckoned i would not say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge . ) i said it was pretty bad money . but maybe the hair ball would take it , because maybe it would not know the difference . [male] smelt it and bit it and rubbed it . and said he would manage so the hair ball would think it was good .
as good and honorable service as has been done in [location] by seventy five or a hundred other englishmen of courage . rectitude , and distinguished capacity , for [location] has been a fertile breeding ground of such men . and remains so ; great men , both in war and in the civil service . and as modest as great , but they have no monuments , and were not expecting any . [male] could not have been expecting one , and it is not at all likely that he desired one .
no care free prospector , singing his way through the mojave desert and suddenly finding himself confronted by a rattlesnake . could have experienced so abrupt a change of mood as did ginger at this revolting spectacle . even in their native piccadilly it had been unpleasant to run into mr. [male] . to find him here now was nothing short of nauseating , only one thing could have brought him to this place . obviously , he must have come to see sally ; and with a sudden sinking of the heart ginger remembered the shiny .
the circumstance was told him at hartfield . for the moment , he was silent ; but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself . over a newspaper he held in his hand , hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow i took him for . she had half a mind to resent .
he could not be bribed or cajoled or persuaded or threatened , once , indeed , when he talked with drunken affection of eugene valmont . i conceived a wild notion of declaring myself to him . but a moment 's reflection showed the absolute uselessness of this course . it was not one simard with whom i had to deal . but half a dozen or more , there was simard , sober , half sober .
the game which was to decide the fate of [female] and [female] belonged to the latter variety . a pitch had been mown in the middle of a meadow ( kindly lent by farmer rollitt on condition that he should be allowed to umpire . and his eldest son ted put on to bowl first ) , the team consisted of certain horny handed sons of toil . with terrific golf shots in the direction of square leg . and the enemy 's ranks were composed of the same material .
never again was i to feel my war horse between my knees . never again to hear the kettledrums and silver trumpets behind me as i rode in front of my little rascals . but it comforts my heart , my friends . and it brings the tears to my eyes . to think how great i was upon that last day of my soldier life .
then placing the horn to his lips and drawing a deep breath . he blew with his utmost force , first [male] . raising his mace high in the air with both hands . brought it down with terrible force on [male] 's mailed head . then [male] stood still , and [male] raising his mace in the air brought it down upon [male] 's head .
as he spoke , an aeroplane came sailing over the tops of the trees beyond the tennis lawn . gracefully as a bird it settled on the smooth turf . not twenty yards from where he was seated , roland [organization] stepped stiffly out onto the tennis lawn . his progress rather resembled that of a landsman getting out of an open boat in which he has spent a long and perilous night at sea . he was feeling more wretched than he had ever felt in his life .
when the weather is at all fresh , the landing is positively dangerous , the steam launches which come out to the mail steamers are bound round from stem to stern with huge rope fenders . when the launches are jumping , wriggling and plunging alongside the steamers , it is no easy matter to get into them . and anyone but a sailor or a professional acrobat would find it safest to be lowered over the side in a basket . the voyage to the jetty at person is a brief epitome of the bay of biscay . the australian bight , and the monsoons of the indian ocean .
oh yes , indeed , he tell , he , what ? he was the head , was he ? from the strong minded woman downwards everybody fell . that instant , upon mr spottletoe . who after vainly attempting to be heard in silence was fain to sit down again . folding his arms and shaking his head most wrathfully , and giving mrs spottletoe to understand in dumb show .
i do not know if you happen to be one of those johnnies who are steeped in crime . and so forth , and think nothing of pinching diamond necklaces . if you are not , you will understand that i felt a lot less keen on the job i would taken on when i sat in my room . waiting to get busy , than i had done when i promised to tackle it in the dining room . on paper it all seemed easy enough , but i could not help feeling there was a catch somewhere .
his life was very regular , he would arrive in the morning just in time to sign his name in the attendance book before it was removed to the accountant 's room . that was at ten o'clock , from ten to eleven he would potter . there was nothing going on at that time in his department . and mr waller seemed to take it for granted that he should stroll off to the postage department and talk to psmith . who had generally some fresh grievance against the ring wearing bristow to air .
curiosity is a valuable trait , it will make the simians learn many things . but the curiosity of a simian is as excessive as the toil of an ant . each simian will wish to know more than his head can hold , let alone ever deal with . and those whose minds are active will wish to know everything going , it would stretch a god 's skull to accomplish such an ambition . yet simians wo not like to think it 's beyond their powers .
at the same time i had a name bestowed on me . which was barcino , i liked my second master . and my new duty very well ; i was careful and diligent in watching the flock . and never quitted it except in the afternoons , when i went to repose under the shade of some tree . or rock , or bank , or by the margin of one of the many streams that watered the country .
`` i will be the buttons , '' said blackie . and disappeared into the hallway , `` oh , yes , i have heard about you , '' came to our ears a moment later , in a high , clear voice . a dear , beloved voice that sent me flying to the door in an agony of hope , [female] ! i cried , [female] , [female] ! [female] !
the clemens fortunes had been poor in [location] . [male] clemens , the father . was a lawyer , a man of education . but he was a dreamer , too , full of schemes that usually failed . born in [location] , he had grown up in [location] .
for he hopped like a cricket ; like a pea in a saucepan . or a new rubber ball on a nursery floor . he tucked up his front legs ; he hopped on his hind legs . he stuck out his tail for a balance weight behind him . and he hopped through the darling downs .
there , again , is blackwood 's magazine -- conspicuous for modest elegance and amiable satire . that review never passes the bounds of politeness in a joke . it is the arbiter of manners . and , while gently exposing the foibles of londoners ( for whom the beaux esprits of edinburgh entertain a justifiable contempt ) . it is never coarse in its fun , the fiery enthusiasm of the athenaeum is well known .
there was another silence , lasting for about a quarter of a mile . that night , after dinner , mrs mariner asked jill to read to her . `` print tries my eyes so , dear , '' said mrs mariner , it was a small thing . but it had the significance of that little cloud that arose out of the sea like a man 's hand .
[male] kept on turning to the right , but it seemed a long way . and his cousin said he supposed it was a very big maze . [male] began to think it rather strange himself . but he held on until , at last , they passed the half of a penny bun on the ground that [male] 's cousin swore he had noticed there seven minutes ago . [female] said : `` oh , impossible , '' but the woman with the baby said .
jones afterwards proceeded very gravely to sing forth the happiness of those subjects who live under such a magistrate . indeed their happiness appears to have been so compleat , that we are aware lest some advocate for arbitrary power should hereafter quote the case of those people . as an instance of the great advantages which attend that government above all others . in reality , i know but of one solid objection to absolute monarchy . the only defect in which excellent constitution seems to be , the difficulty of finding any man adequate to the office of an absolute monarch .
as stated , she emerges , in the doorway she runs into a woman of her acquaintance . if she likes the other woman she is cordial . but if she does not like her she is very , very cordial , a woman 's aversion for another woman moving in the same social stratum in which she herself moves may readily be appraised . invariably it is in inverse ratio to the apparent affection she displays upon encountering the object of her disfavor . why should this be ? i can not answer , it is not given for [location] to know .
now , touching this business of old [male] -- my man . you know -- how do we stand ? lots of people think i am much too dependent on him . my aunt [female] , in fact . has even gone so far as to call him my keeper , well , what i say is , why not ? the man 's a genius , from the collar upward he stands alone .
then i waits till mr. [male] is in the bathroom with the water running so as to hide the sound of my voice . and i goes to the telephone and i calls up miss [female] number over on riverside drive . she must have rose early so as to have her complexion laid on so it will get set good before she goes out for the day . because it 's her which answers my call instead of the maid . i tells her it 's me on the wire and i asks her .
a great mistake is lying round loose hereabouts , -- a mistake fatal to many friendships that did run well . the common fallacy is that intimacy dispenses with the necessity of politeness . the truth is just the opposite of this , the more points of contact there are . the more danger of friction there is , and the more carefully should people guard against it . if you see a man only once a month .
but , alas , it did not crush , no , i had to give it up . what those people valued was high wages ; it did not seem to be a matter of any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything or not . they stood for `` protection , '' and swore by it . which was reasonable enough , because interested parties had gulled them into the notion that it was protection which had created their high wages . i proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages had advanced but 30 per cent. .
suddenly a loud cry broke the silence -- a scream as of a strong man in mortal agony ! it struck all of them that the voice was uncommonly like agamemnon 's . but none liked to say so , and they only observed with a forced composure that really the cats were becoming quite a nuisance . the cry came again , louder this time , and more distinct . it seemed to come from the direction of the royal bath room .
great crowds to see [location] off , nearly ran over several in effort to reach starting post , very careless . people ought not to get in the way on these occasions , noise appalling . cheers , snatches of marseillaise . snorts of motors , curses of competitors . cries of bystanders knocked down by enthusiastic chauffeurs .
now , every town where i have been at heretofore to this . when the fire bell rings everybody drops whatever they is doing and goes to the fire . elsewhere from [location] , enjoying fires is one of the main pleasures of people . but soon i is surprised to see that i am pretty near the only person which is trailing along after the department . whilst i am still wondering over this circumstance .
[female] hitched it behind with the hooks . and it was a fair fit , i put on the sun bonnet and tied it under my chin . and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove pipe . [female] said nobody would know me . even in the daytime , hardly , i practiced around all day to get the hang of the things .
school of direct appeal , it is strictly an advertising property and has long been used to sell merchandise to people who never can resist the flattery of being addressed personally . when used as an advertisement it is usually accompanied by an illustration built along the lines of the pioneer grocery clerk . pointing a virile finger at you from the page of the magazine . and putting the whole thing on a personal basis by addressing you as `` you , mr , rider in the open cars ! '' or `` you , mr , wearer of 14½ shirts , '' the appeal is instantaneous .
his promenade carried him out of earshot at the critical moment when he was about to disclose the elusive identity . the lady who ? [male] could scarcely run after a total stranger . break into his conversation , and ask him for information concerning a chance passer-by . besides , it was desirable that he should keep up the appearance of looking after the luggage . in a minute or two , however , the important personage , the man who knew .
such , my dear friend , in brief , is the state of many of those foreign governments to whom we are so profuse of our wise counsels . it were doubtless much better if they ruled well ; but let [location] see if the road to this knotty consummation be by the adoption of methods totally new to them . estranged from all their instincts and habits , and full of perils which their very fears will exaggerate . constitutional governments , like underdone roast beef . suit our natures and our latitude ; but they would seem lamentable experiments when tried south of the alps .
elsie sir , we sang to these folk . and they would have repaid [location] with gross courtesy . but for your honour 's coming , now , my girl , who are you . and what do you here ? elsie may it please you . sir , we are two strolling players , [female] point and i .
it seemed to be a part of corps etiquette to keep a dog or so , too . i mean a corps dog -- the common property of the organization . like the corps steward or head servant . then there are other dogs , owned by individuals , on a summer afternoon in the castle gardens . i have seen six students march solemnly into the grounds .
witch means , a woman who practices sorcery under an agreement with the devil . who helps her , before the christian era , the jewish witch was a mere diviner or at most a raiser of the dead . and the gentile witch was a poisoner . a maker of philtres or love potions . and a vulgar sort of magician , the devil part of the business did not begin until a good while after [female] .
it might be taken by the partially intelligent kensitite as a judgment on latin christians for talking latin . it might be taken by the somewhat less intelligent professor harnack as a final proof that all prehistoric humanity talked german . but when all was said , the symbol would remain that a plain tower . as straight as a sword , as simple as a [male] , did nevertheless produce the deepest divisions that have been known among men . in any case we of the world in revolt .
i trust that a large majority of this general conference will say with emphasis we are not ready for any such action . the women of our methodism have a place in the heart of the church from which they can not be dislodged . they are our chief working members , they are at the very front of every great movement of the church at home or abroad . in the spirit of rejoicing consecration our matrons and maids uphold the banner of our lord in every conflict with the enemy of virtue and righteousness . looking down upon america from these galleries , tier upon tier , are the magnificent leaders of the woman 's foreign and the woman 's home missionary societies .
a house without woman or firelight is like a body without soul or spirit . beware of meat twice boil would . and an old foe reconcil would , the heart of a fool is in his mouth . but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart . he that is rich need not live sparingly , and he that can live sparingly need not be rich .
petulantly i wrestled my form free , and instantly those breeches seemed to leap outward in all directions away from me . i grabbed for them , and barely in time i got a grip on the yawning top hem . peering down the cavelike orifice that now confronted me i beheld two spectral white columns . and recognized them as my own legs , in the same instant . also , i realized what that hard clump against my spine was , because when he took his hand away the clump was gone .
fritchie , [female] , a southern target . sprang into poetry as the only woman in the history of mankind who admitted her old age . galileo , inventor , star gazer . proved himself an imbecile by declaring the world revolved when everybody knew it was stationary . manufactured the first spy glass , an instrument which has since been used in theatres and for various other purposes .
all of a sudden he saw a splendid camel strut by him quite closely . stretching its long legs and puffing out its throat like a turkey cock . and that made his heart throb , camels already , eh ? lions could not be far off now ; and , indeed , in five minutes time he did see a whole band of lion hunters coming his way under arms .
i can not expect that any of my readers will believe the story which i am about to narrate . looking back upon it , i scarcely believe it myself . yet my narrative is so extraordinary and throws such light upon the nature of our communications with beings of another world . that i feel i am not entitled to withhold it from the public , i had gone over to visit [male] at his rooms . it was saturday , october 31 , i remember the date so precisely because it was my pay day .
friendship must be physically dirty if it is to be morally clean , it must be in its shirt sleeves . the chaos of habits that always goes with males when left entirely to themselves has only one honorable cure . and that is the strict discipline of a monastery , anyone who has seen our unhappy young idealists in east end settlements losing their collars in the wash and living on tinned salmon will fully understand why it was decided by the wisdom ofbernard orbenedict . that if men were to live without women , they must not live without rules . something of the same sort of artificial exactitude .
the [location] 's crust is variously estimated in the matter of thickness . some think it is 2,500 miles thick , which would make it safe to run heavy trains across the [location] anywhere on top of a second mortgage . while other scientists say that if we go down one tenth of that distance we will reach a place where the worm dieth not . i do not wish to express an opinion as to the actual depth or thickness of the [location] 's crust . but i believe that it is none too thick to suit me , thickness in the [location] 's crust is a mighty good fault .
there is , however , between a good detective story and a bad detective story as much . or , rather more , difference than there is between a good epic and a bad one . not only is a detective story a perfectly legitimate form of art . but it has certain definite and real advantages as an agent of the public weal . the first essential value of the detective story lies in this , that it is the earliest and only form of popular literature in which is expressed some sense of the poetry of modern life .
pope the actor , well known for his devotion to the culinary art . received an invitation to dinner , accompanied by an apology for the simplicity of the intended fare . a small turbot and a boiled edgebone of beef . the very thing of all others that i like , ', exclaimed pope . `` i will come with the greatest pleasure '' : and come he did .
she had reached a turning point thirty feet down . she heard a faint muffled answer far to the left . and with a touch of panic fled toward it . she passed another turning , two more yawning alleys , no answer . she started to run straight forward , and then turned like lightning and sped back the way she had come .
a big music person where lovers of music could find pleasure at any time . and where weekly concerts was given , most of the performers being of the musically inclined amongst the young people in the city of justice . a pretty little theatre where they could act out little plays and dramas of a helpful , inspirin ', sort . a big gymnasium full of the best appliances and latest helps to physical culture . a large bathing tank where the white marble steps led down to cool .
it was during that evening that there flitted across his mind the first suspicion he had ever had that his uncle [male] 's mental outlook was a little limited . and now , as he paced the promenade , watching the stir and bustle of the crowd . he definitely condemned his absent relative as a narrow-minded chump . if the brown boots which he had [male] so assiduously in his bedroom that morning with the inside of a banana skin . and which now gleamed for the first time on his feet , had a fault .
he went out , leaving mr. [male] a prey to many and varied emotions . he had only been gone a few minutes when mr. [male] 's meditations were again interrupted . this time , the visitor was a stranger to him . a dark faced , clean shaven man , he did not wear evening clothes . so could not be one of the guests ; and mr. [male] could not place him immediately .
it was all over , i was hopelessly ruined now , my weak fancy that even a spectre would have some remnants of common decency and good feeling hanging about it . had put the finishing touch to my misfortunes ! i paid for the smashed platform and windows with the money that had been taken at the doors . and then i travelled back to [location] , third class , that night . with the feeling that everything was against me .
whether it was that the man of coffins met the gaze of any particularly cross eyed waiter . or was overcome by the laughter called forth by my solemn request . an outbreak foreign to the ears of a gentleman of his calling -- i know not . but he promptly vanished , later in the evening a request came from him for a present of one of the coffin shaped salt cellars . and no doubt the one i sent him will adorn his window for another fifty four years .
( if the neighbour pushes his paper towards him with a friendly smile . that of course is a different matter , ) but he is greatly addicted to a more venial crime known as `` paving . '' the paver prepares his translation in the orthodox manner . but whenever he has occasion to look up a word in a lexicon he scribbles its meaning in the margin of the text . or , more frequently , just over the word itself , to guard against loss of memory on the morrow .
`` why , you do know something about it after all ! '' cried [female] , startled into a sort of friendliness in spite of herself . and at the words and the sight of her quick smile sam 's professional composure reeled on its foundations . he had half risen . with the purpose of springing up and babbling of the passion that consumed him .
the two had the wizard of finance between them . and they were marching him up to the university . he was taken along much as is an arrested man who has promised to go quietly . they kept their hands off him . but they watched him sideways through their spectacles .
which is my case exactly , i have seen so many horrid visitants from other worlds that they hardly affect me at all . so far as the mere inspiration of terror is concerned , on the other hand . they interest me hugely . and while i must admit that i do experience all the purely physical sensations that come from horrific encounters of this nature . i can truly add in my own behalf that mentally i can rise above the physical impulse to run away .
a sigh , and they departed , the church was invisible . but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour . this was a stained window , through which some feeble light was shining , and when the door opened [male] heard mr. [male] 's voice running through the litany to a minute congregation . even their church , built upon the slope of the hill so artfully . with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingle .
mr. [male] , mr. [male] . can not that request be modified so as to provide for taking the vote on the passage of the bill instead of on the engrossment and third reading ? i ask unanimous consent that the vote may be taken on the passage of the bill , the [male] . the chair will state that the roll call having disclosed the absence of a quorum . no business is in order but a call of the house or a motion to adjourn .
we felt a strong temptation , at one point . to turn into a village inn as we passed and have a cheese and a few loaves between us . but we heroically restrained ourselves : we should enjoy the duck all the better for being famished . we fancied we smelled it when we go into the town and did the last quarter of a mile in three minutes . we rushed upstairs , and washed ourselves .
the silence which had fallen upon the room as she left it . was broken by mr trevis , jill walked out into forty second street . looking about her with the eye of a conqueror . very little change had taken place in the aspect of [location] since she had entered the gotham theatre . but it seemed a different city to her , an hour ago .
at eight o'clock on the third morning out from [location] . land was sighted , away across the sunny waves one saw a faint dark stripe stretched along under the horizon or pretended to see it . for the credit of his eyesight , even the reverend said he saw it . a thing which was manifestly not so , but i never have seen any one who was morally strong enough to confess that he could not see land when others claimed that they could . by and by the bermuda islands were easily visible , the principal one lay upon the water in the distance .
the day passed wearily for [female] , nutty having the air of one who is still engaged in picking up the pieces . she had not the heart to ask him to play his customary part in the household duties . so she washed the dishes and made the beds herself . after that she attended to the bees , after that she cooked lunch . nutty was not chatty at lunch , having observed `` about now the blighter is cursing the waiter for bringing the wrong brand of champagne , ''
in one circumstance relating to courtship , the italians are said to be particular , they protract the time as long as possible . well knowing that even with all the little ills attending it , a period thus employed is one of the sweetest of human life . a french lover , with the word sentiment perpetually in his mouth . seems by every action to have excluded it from his heart . he places his whole confidence in his exterior air and appearance .
breakfast was a nightmare , lunch was rather worse . and as for dinner , it was quite unspeakable , [female] seemed to gather force during the day . it was not the actual presence of the lady that revolted the babe . for that was passable enough , it was her conversation that killed . she refused to let the babe alone , she was intensely learned herself .
`` that 's that miss pratt , '' observed miss boke , following [female] 's gaze with some interest . `` you met her yet ? '' [male] lifted his right hand from his ankle and passed it . time after time , across his damp forehead . he did not believe that miss pratt could have expressed herself in so mercenary a manner . but if she had -- well , one fact in british history had so impressed him that he remembered it even after examination .
it would not become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that i was a tired man and very sleepy . i wished i had gone off to bed when i had the chance . now i must stick it out ; there was no other way , so she tinkled along and along . in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush of the sleeping castle . until by and by there came , as if from deep down under us , a far-away sound .
i knew , then , how a mother feels when women . whether strangers or friends , take her new baby . and close themselves about it with one eager impulse . and bend their heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it were not . for that time , i knew how she feels , and that there is no other satisfied ambition .
we concluded to make a tour between the inner fences . we elected to walk upright , for convenience 's sake . we argued that if discerned , we should be taken for friends rather than enemies . and in any case we should be out of reach of swords . and these gentry did not seem to have any spears along , well , it was a curious trip .
finally had a row with his brother , and was knocked out in the first round . [male] , a patriarch whose descendants now own [location] . [location] , vast sections of the remainder of the globe . and control the pawn broking , diamond , theatrical , and old clothing markets . camel and sheep merchant , considerable land was willed him , a. prospered , married [male] .
there awful stupid , if theres anything solid you get it in the pan with the rim on it . then they pour the soup on your cover . when you sit down half what you got left spills out on the table . it isnt so bad now cause everything freezes about as soon as it hits . the fello that invented our eatin tables must have been a supply sargent once .
upon a discussion of the subject with him . it appeared that he considered the project distinctly and decidedly dangerous . i was not convinced , yet i was not willing to try the experiment in any risky way . that is , in a way that might cripple the strength and efficiency of the expedition . i was about at my wits end when it occurred to me to try it on the latinist .
if by fraud he commit adultery with a woman of an equal or inferior cast . the magistrate shall take his possessions , brand him in the forehead . and banish him the kingdom , such are the laws of the shaster . so far as they regard all the superior casts , except the bramins . but if any of the most inferior casts commit adultery with a woman of the casts greatly superior .
for some moments [female] sat without speaking . if this had not been one of his napoleonic mornings , no doubt the sudden arrival of his old friend . mr. [male] , whom he had imagined at his home in putney packing for his trip to [location] . would have suggested nothing to him , as it was it suggested a great deal . he had had a brain wave , and for fully a minute he sat tingling under its impact .
clubs : [male] , august , a frenchman who did his utmost to fill european and [location] galleries with statues at a price which would have made [male] a billionaire . rojesvensky , admiral , a great russian admiral and sea fighter who gloriously defeated the fishing squadron in the english channel . later hit a snag in the orient , romeo , [organization] 's best fellow . who learned that his road to true love ended in a cemetery . romulus , remus twin . collaborated with his brother in home life and in building rome .
mark twain in that time contributed fifty two or three letters to the `` alta [location] '' and six to the `` [location] tribune , '' or an average of nearly three a week . a vast amount of labor to be done in the midst of sight-seeing . and what letters of travel they were ! the most remarkable that had been written up to that time , vivid , fearless , full of fresh color .
the inspector breathed hard , mr. [male] looked grave and concerned . the plain clothes men looked blank . bindle looked cheerful , whilst the foreman looked as a man looks only once in a lifetime . deliberately he approached the tail of the van . undid the lock , removed the bar , threw open the doors .
throughout the whole country nothing but the approaching match was discussed . wherever civilization reigned , and in portions of liverpool . one question alone was on every lip : who would win ? octogenarians mumbled it . infants lisped it , tired city men . trampled under foot in the rush for their tram .
now , what does the right of suffrage do ? it carries with it the right to hold office . where women have the privileges of voting on the school question . they are granted the privilege of being school directors . holding the office of superintendents , and the restriction on them stops at that point under statute law . if you go a little further you will find that when the freedmen were enfranchised .
`` merci , monsieur. '' he goes out . the audience feel a thrill of pride at having learned french and being able to follow the intense realism of this dialogue . the maid lays the letter on the supper table . just as she does it the door opens and there enter mr. [male] and lady cicely . yes , them , both of them , the audience catches it like a flash .
squinty walked over and tried to find a few drops in the bottom of the wooden trough . these he licked up with his red tongue , but there was not nearly enough , ha ! i guess that little pig must be hungry , said the farmer looking down in the pen , after he had put some more stones and a board over the hole where squinty had gotten out . i guess i will have to feed him .
the real hydrophobia dog generally ignores kindness . and devotes himself mostly to the introduction of his justly celebrated virus . a good thing to do on observing the approach of a mad dog is to flee . and remain fled until he has disappeared , hunting mad dogs in a crowded street is great sport . a young man with a new revolver shooting at a mad dog is a fine sight .
her mere entry dazzled him , there is no knowing with a woman like belvane . and i believe she had purposely kept herself plain during these last few days so that she might have the weapon of her beauty to fall back upon in case anything went wrong . things had indeed gone wrong ; udo had become a man again ; and it was against the man that this last weapon was directed . udo himself was only too ready , the fact that he was once more attractive to women meant as much as anything to him . to have been attractive to hyacinth would have contented most of us , but udo felt a little uncomfortable with her .
as he drew near , he heard a slow and dirge like whistling proceeding from the interior . plunging in out of breath , just as the deluge began . he found hargate seated at the little wooden table with an earnest expression on his face . the table was covered with cards , hargate had not yet been compelled to sprain his wrist . having adopted the alternative of merely refusing invitations to play billiards .
but the horse did not mind it , i have seen a german . weary with abusing his horse , call to his wife to come out and assist him . when she came , he told her what the horse had done . the recital roused the woman 's temper to almost equal heat with his own . and standing one each side of the poor beast , they both abused it .
being now perfectly gratified , she already begins to mention their return to town . and has desired [location] to accompany her , we can not refuse her request since it is seconded by the commands of our father . and thirded by the entreaties of mr. [male] who is certainly one of the most pleasing young men . i ever beheld , it is not yet determined when we are to go . but when ever we do we shall certainly take our little louisa with us .
eliza spoke quite snappishly , and said that my linen was always properly aired , and that i was too fussy . i replied , without losing my temper , that there was airing and airing , even now i can not think that eliza was either just or accurate . at breakfast time one or two other little circumstances occurred to put me out , a teacup which is filled so full that it overflows into the saucer is a perfect thorn in the flesh to me . so is bacon which is burnt to a cinder , i hardly did more than mention it . but eliza seemed put out ; she said i did nothing but find fault .
van tricasse , the burgomaster . was forced to make police regulations concerning the domestic animals , as , seized with lunacy . they rendered the streets of quiquendone unsafe . there was a kind of insurrection at the high school . and the dictionaries became formidable missiles in the classes .
his presentiment , or superstition , that it was an evil journey . did not at all deter him from doing the evil for which the journey was undertaken . with this in view , he dressed himself more carefully than usual to make a favourable impression on mr pecksniff . and , reassured by his own appearance , the beauty of the morning . and the flashing of the wet boughs outside his window in the merry sunshine .
at this point a massive , grey haired man , who had been standing close by . gazing on the lobby with an air of restrained severity . as if daring it to start anything , joined in the conversation . `` i am the manager , '' he said , his eye was cold and hostile . others , it seemed to say , might like archie moffam .
whenever annette came to his studio he was either sitting in a chair with his feet on the window sill . smoking , or in the same attitude listening to sellers views on art , sellers being on the upgrade . a man with many pounds to his credit in the bank . had more leisure now , he had given up his advertisement work .
but meanwhile there was high council being held among the wisest of them all , the students and thinkers who had been gathering facts from [location] all this time . collating and relating them , and making inferences , laid the result of their labors before the council . with the lightest touch , different women asking different questions at different times . and putting all our answers together like a picture puzzle . they had figured out a sort of skeleton chart as to the prevalence of disease among us .
escaped from polyphemus , a one-eyed giant , by sticking a burning telegraph pole in his eye . later performed his greatest feat by evading the sirens , stayed away from home so much his wife forgot what he looked like . his dog , however , recalled the scent and prevented u. from sleeping in the barn . press agent : homer . recreation . travel , wars , address : ithaca .
she attacks its hand and destroys her also ; she attacks the fishwife 's leg and destroys her also . she attacks its body and consumes him . she wreathes herself about its heart and it is consumed . next about its breast , and in a moment she is a cinder . now she reaches its neck -- he goes .
on the following morning it was settled among them that the dowager should insist on possession of her own house at cross [female] . and a letter was written to the marquis , congratulating him of course on his marriage . but informing him at the same time that the family would remain in the parish . some few days later mr. [male] , the agent for the property . came down from [location] , he had received the orders of the marquis .
it was a very different place from the last tavern in which he had regaled . boasting no greater extent of accommodation than the brick floored kitchen yielded . but the mind so soon accommodates itself to the necessities of the body . that this poor waggoner 's house of call , which he would have despised yesterday . became now quite a choice hotel ; while his dish of eggs and bacon .
he did not realise this for some time , it was borne in upon him when the road he was taking suddenly came to an abrupt end in a blank wall . instead of being , as he had fancied , in the high street , he must have branched off into some miserable blind alley . more than ever he wished he had not come , eckleton was not a town that took up a great deal of room on the map of england . but it made up for small dimensions by the eccentricity with which it had been laid out . on a dark and foggy night , to one who knew little of its geography .
it was time for idle strangers to go and ask leave to look down out of a gallery and see what would be the result of it . and now took place that memorable sitting of the house which broke two records . it lasted the best part of two days and a night . surpassing by half an hour the longest sitting known to the world 's previous parliamentary history . and breaking the long speech record with dr. person 's twelve hour effort .
after these words the bridal bonnet disappeared ; with as much state as the dimity bedgown left in it . old [male] gave his arm to the younger sister without speaking . and led her out , mrs todgers . with her holiday garments fluttering in the wind . accompanied them to the carriage , clung round merry 's neck at parting .
my name is algernon weatherhead , and i may add that i am in one of the government departments . that i am an only son , and live at home with my mother . we had had a house at hammersmith until just before the period covered by this history . when , our lease expiring , my mother decided that my health required country air at the close of the day . and so we took a `` desirable villa residence ''
[female] eliza flung her handkerchief over her head . could she sacrifice what hair she had to the claims of literature ? she gave a cry of dismay . the little boys rushed in a moment to the rescue . they flapped newspapers , flung sofa cushions .
she spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , mr. [male] . she was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation . wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described . and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her . but his gaiety did not meet hers , he found he could not be useful .
gertrude [female] had held a silent place in the little circle gathered about the two gentlemen from [location] . she was not interested in the visitors ; she was watching madame [female] . as she constantly watched her , she knew that [female] also was not interested . that she was bored ; and [female] was absorbed in study of the problem how . in spite of her indifference and her absent attention .
what a time of it dawson 's landing was having ! all its life it had been asleep , but now it hardly got a chance for a nod . so swiftly did big events and crashing surprises come along in one another 's wake . friday morning , first glimpse of real nobility . also grand reception at aunt [female] .
i turned away , i could not listen ; i could not look . i did not know whither to go or what to do , mechanically and without knowing it . i put my eye to that strange instrument , and there was peking and the czar 's procession ! the next moment i was leaning out of the window . gasping , suffocating , trying to speak , but dumb from the very imminence of the necessity of speaking .
there are many men alive today who do not dare say anything without first thinking how it will read in their memoirs . men whom we can not , therefore , thoroughly enjoy until they are dead . and yet whose graves will be kept green only so long as the appropriation lasts . i have one letter from a man of twenty seven summers . who pants to bestow himself on some one at as early a date as possible .
on entering the meeting house , mr. [male] found some thirty persons assembled . most of them women , if there were any `` official members '' present , they made themselves in no way officious in regard to the preacher . who , after pausing at the door leading into the little altar or chancel for a short time . and looking around with an expression of inquiry on his face .
then , not as it were gradually , but quite suddenly , i woke up . sat up , and looked about me , i found myself lying , or rather sitting up . on a broad couch , i was in a great room . dim , gloomy , and dilapidated in its general appearance . and apparently , from its glass cases and the stuffed figures that they contained .
the comic man is happy under any fate , and he says funny things at funerals and when the bailiffs are in the house or the hero is waiting to be hanged . this sort of man is rather trying in real life . in real life such a man would probably be slaughtered to death and buried at an early period of his career . but on the stage they put up with him . he is very good , is the comic man , he can not bear villainy .
becket objected to a priest being tried even by the lord chief justice . and his reason was simple : because the lord chief justice was being tried by the priest . the judiciary was itself sub judice . the kings were themselves in the dock . the idea was to create an invisible kingdom , without armies or prisons .
i hear you are devoting yourself to literature . and i beg that you will avail yourself of the enclosed note . which is addressed to a personal friend of mine , i had received the letter at breakfast . i took a cab , and drove straight to the orb . my letter was taken down a mysterious stone passage .
ern , do not run away , listen to me . are you all crazy ? [male] , what would you with me , spectre ? oh , ai not his eyes sepulchral , and ai not his voice hollow ! what are you doing out of your tomb at this time of day , apparition , ern . i do wish i could make you girls understand that i am only technically dead .
a discussion of the new social unrest , the transformation of society which it portends and the social catastrophe which it might precipitate . the point of view taken by the author leads towards the conclusion that the safety of the future lies in a progressive movement of social control alleviating at least the misery it can not obliterate . and based upon the broad general principle of equality of opportunity . and a fair start , the chief immediate opportunities for social betterment . as the writer sees them , lie in the attempt to give every human being in childhood .
and he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy . pummelling the air , and kicking and gouging , oh , you do , do you ? you holler `` nough , do you ? now , then , let that learn you ! '' and so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction , [male] fled home at noon . his conscience could not endure any more of amy 's grateful happiness .
i ought to give you all my impressions of [location] , i suppose . but i have grown so used to the place that i do not think i have any now . i seem to have been here years and years . you will see by the address that mr. [male] has not yet sold his inheritance . he expects to do so very soon , he tells me .
they chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation . and the floods of love and sincerity . which fructify every hour of life , burst forth in tumult . they descended from the carriages ; they embraced each other . it was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them .
it is a simple and easily worked plan , and there has been some talk lately of its being made use of by the angling fraternity in general . indeed , the committee of the thames angler 's association did recommend its adoption about two years ago . but some of the older members opposed it , they said they would consider the idea if the number were doubled . and each fish counted as twenty , if ever you have an evening to spare . up the river , i should advise you to drop into one of the little village inns .
the boys , if less subdued , were in better temper than the evening before . and found it troublesome to keep up a feud when the first flush of resentment had died out . there was a general disposition to forget his departure from the code of schoolboy honour . and give him an opportunity of retrieving the past , but he would not meet them half-way . his repeated repulses by the doctor and all the difficulties that beset his return to freedom had made him very sulky and snappish .
it is probably a thorough conviction of the necessity of eating and drinking . and a constant contemplation from a penitentiary point of view of the consequences of so doing without paying therefor . that induces our modern witches to charge a specific sum for the exercise of their art . and to demand the inevitable dollar in advance , whatever there is of sorcery . astrology , necromancy , prophecy , fortune telling .
gentlemen will wear one pocket handkerchief in the side pocket . with the corner gently emerging , and another in the hip pocket . as they did last season , the former for decorative purposes and the latter for business . this is a wise provision and never fails to elicit favorable comment , the custom of wearing a few kernels of roasted coffee or a dozen cloves in the little cigarette pocket of the cutaway coat will still continue . and the supply will be replenished between the acts , as heretofore .
alike for those who for the drouth prepared and those who , like myself , more poorly fared . fond memory weaves roseate shrouds to dress departed spirits we have loved , and shared . myself when young did eagerly frequent the gilded bar , and all my lucre spent for bottled joyousness . but evermore came out less steadily than in i went , the legal finger writes . and having writ , moves on -- and neither thirst nor wit has lured it back to cancel half a line to give a man excuse for being lit .
[female] winfield slept the peaceful sleep of childhood in his sterilized cot . the light gleamed faintly on the white tiles , it lit up the brass knobs on the walls . the spotless curtains , the large thermometer . an intruder , interested in these things , would have seen by a glance at this last that the temperature of the room was exactly that recommended by doctors as the correct temperature for the nursery of a sleeping child . no higher , no lower , the transom over the door was closed , but the window was open at the top to precisely the extent advocated by the authorities .
there are three kinds of bachelors : the kind that must be driven into matrimony with a whip . the kind that must be coaxed with sugar ; and the kind that must be blindfolded and backed into the shafts . if you want to be chosen to brighten a bachelor 's life . first make it dark and dreary ; so long as women are willing to make his existence one long sweet song . naturally he is not anxious to exchange it for a lullaby .
clarence chuckled grimly as the tape clicked out the news . the end had begun , to sow jealousy between the rival generals would have been easy . to sow it between two rival music hall artistes would be among the world 's softest jobs . among the general public , of course , the announcement created a profound sensation . nothing else was talked about in train and omnibus .
when the preacher concluded this extract from the well-known icelandic poet he paused and looked downward . breathing heavily through his nose , like [male] in the third act , it was amebius whose immortal lines he recited in order to prove the extreme error of the position assumed in the controversy by the famous italian , polenta . he had them going , and there was not a thing to it . when he would get tired of faking philosophy he would quote from a celebrated poet of ecuador or tasmania or some other seaport town . compared with this verse , all of which was of the same school as the icelandic masterpiece .
before all else it was necessary to ascertain whether the lion had been killed on the civil or the military territory . in the former case the matter regarded the tribunal of commerce . in the second , [male] would be dealt with by the council of war . and at the mere name the impressionable [male] saw himself shot at the foot of the ramparts or huddled up in a casemate silo . the puzzle lay in the limitation of the two territories being very hazy in [location] .
[male] also assisted perkin , his new brother in law . in an invasion of england , which failed , after which the pretender gave himself up . he was hanged amid great applause at tyburn . and the earl of warwick , with whom he had planned to escape . was beheaded at tower hill , thus , in 1499 , perished the last of the plantagenets of the male kind .
i spent most of each day with him , merely sitting by the bed and reading . i noticed when he slept that his breathing was difficult . and i could see that he did not improve , but often he was gay and liked the entire family to gather about and be merry . it was only a few days before we sailed that the severe attacks returned . then followed bad nights ; but respite came , and we sailed on the 12th , as arranged .
there are people in the world who will take a great deal of trouble to point out the faults in a religion or a language . and then go blandly about their business without suggesting any remedy , i am not that kind of person . i have shown that the german language needs reforming , very well , i am ready to reform it . at least i am ready to make the proper suggestions , such a course as this might be immodest in another . but i have devoted upward of nine full weeks .
according to the daily chronicle , an [location] professor is looking forward to the time when cooking and dining shall become lost arts . and we shall take our sustenance in the form of tablets of concentrated things . our esteemed contemporary appears to think that such a system would necessarily do away with all conviviality and social intercourse . but , unless mr. [male] 's clairvoyant is liable to error , we need not take quite so gloomy a view of the future . people will still entertain , only the dinner of the next century will be a more economical and less tedious function .
[male] was the son of [male] . duke of york , and cecily neville , daughter of the earl of westmoreland . his father being the legitimate heir to the throne by descent in the female line . so he was the head of the yorkists in the war of the roses . [male] 's father , the duke of york .
we knew of a boarding house , and what we needed now was somebody to pilot [location] to it . presently a little barefooted colored boy came along , whose raggedness was conspicuously not bermudian . his rear was so marvelously bepatched with colored squares and triangles that one was half persuaded he had got it out of an atlas . when the sun struck him right , he was as good to follow as a lightning bug . we hired him and dropped into his wake .
`` he wo not have forgotten you , '' said bream mortimer confidently . he did not see how it was humanly possible for anyone to forget this woman . she was like a celebrated chewing gum , the taste lingered . mrs. [female] was a woman of instant and decisive action . even while her late visitor was speaking schemes had begun to form in her mind like bubbles rising to the surface of a rushing river .
jones then apprehended it might lead to some other apartment . but upon searching all round it , he could perceive no other door than that at which he entered . and where the centinel had been posted , he then proceeded to call [organization] several times by his name . but no one answered ; nor did this serve to any other purpose than to confirm the centinel in his terrors . who was now convinced that the volunteer was dead of his wounds , and that his ghost was come in search of the murderer .
`` ah , '' said mrs gamp . walking away from the bed , `` he would make a lovely corpse . '' she now proceeded to unpack her bundle ; lighted a candle with the aid of a fire box on the drawers . filled a small kettle , as a preliminary to refreshing herself with a cup of tea in the course of the night . laid what she called `` a little bit of fire , ''
he loved claire with a passionate fervour . he liked [male] very much indeed , he submitted this diagnosis to conscience . and conscience graciously approved and accepted it , from time to time . as he walked along the road , he took out the photograph and did some more gazing . the last occasion on which he did this was just as he emerged from the shadow of a large tree that stood by the roadside .
i took a large room , far up broadway , in a huge old building whose upper stories had been wholly unoccupied for years until i came . the place had long been given up to dust and cobwebs , to solitude and silence . i seemed groping among the tombs and invading the privacy of the dead . that first night i climbed up to my quarters . for the first time in my life a superstitious dread came over me .
and , after all , that warming glow is more suited to our cold little back parlor of a world than is the burning spirit love . love should be the vestal fire of some mighty temple -- some vast dim fane whose organ music is the rolling of the spheres . affection will [male] cheerily when the white flame of love is flickered out . affection is a fire that can be fed from day to day and be piled up ever higher as the wintry years draw nigh . old men and women can sit by it with their thin hands clasped .
i am not saying that in the course of our long association i have always found myself able to view [male] with approval . there are aspects of his character which have frequently caused coldnesses to arise between us . he is one of those fellows who , if you give them a thingummy . take a what d'you call it , his work is often raw , and he has been known to allude to me as `` mentally negligible '' more than once , as i have shown , it has been my painful task to squelch in him a tendency to get uppish and treat the young master as a serf or peon .
paul had been careful , whilst in the hearing of his friends . to give the cabman a fictitious address , but as soon as he reached the euston road . he stopped the man and ordered him to put him down at the church near the south end of westbourne terrace . for he dared not drive up openly to his own door , at last he found himself standing safely on the pavement . looking down the long line of yellow lamps of his own terrace .
below person we passed hornberg . goetz person berlichingen 's old castle . it stands on a bold elevation two hundred feet above the surface of the river . it has high vine clad walls enclosing trees . and a peaked tower about seventy five feet high , the steep hillside .
the aspect of the people too , at the stations and in the towns we passed , puzzled me . there were no uniforms , no soldiers , but i was amazed at the number of commercial travellers . lutheran ministers , photographers , and so forth . and the odd resemblance they presented , in spite of their innocent costumes . to the arrogant and ubiquitous military officers whom i had observed on my former visit .
i was neither sorry nor glad when i heard of it . for all places were the same to me just then ; only , as the time drew near . i began to regard the future with a growing dread . the school was at some distance from [location] . and my uncle took me down by rail .
lady elphinspoon , in spite of her elevated position as the wife of the foreign secretary of [location] . held it not beneath her to perform for her husband the plainest household service . she rang for an egg , the butler broke it for her into a tall goblet filled with old sherry . and the noble lady , with her own hands , beat the stuff out of it . for the veteran politician , whose official duties rarely allowed him to eat .
but the old gentleman was the thirteenth earl of derby . the successive earls of derby have been among lear 's kindest and most generous patrons . he went to [male] , and the drawings in the [male] menagerie ( now a rare and highly prized work among book collectors ) . are by lear 's hand , at [male] he became a permanent favorite .
the night was very still , through the trees which flanked the house the dimmed headlights of what was presumably [male] hired car shone faintly like enlarged fire flies . a boat of some description was tooting reflectively far down the river . such was the seductive influence of the time and the scene that [male] might have remained there indefinitely . weaving dreams , had he not been under the necessity of making his way down to the library . it was his task to close the french windows after his father and ogden had passed through .
she favors the dark complexioned man . which means trouble , you face money . but you must earn it , there is a good deal . but you may not get much of it etc. , etc . these words are exactly the sort of stuff that is sold by the witches of today .
amongst others the old priest came forth . the same whom we had seen in the morning , he was all smiles now . and he bore with him some hot punch on a salver . the reek of which i can remember still , behind her father was sophie . with horror i saw her clasp major sergine 's hand as she congratulated him upon the victory he had won and the prisoners he had made .
although his grandfather makes him a moderate allowance . by the aid of post obits and convenient friends he can live in a splendour becoming his rank . he has not distinguished himself in the knocking down of policemen much . he is not big enough for that , but , as a light weight , his skill is of the very highest order . at billiards he is said to be first rate , he drinks and smokes as much as any two of the biggest officers in his regiment .
a cold gleam had come into billie 's eyes . her face was pale and hard , if [male] -- at that moment carolling blithely in his bedroom at the blue boar in windlehurst . washing his hands preparatory to descending to the coffee room for a bit of cold lunch . could have seen her , the song would have frozen on his lips . which , one might mention , as showing that there is always a bright side .
and so it came about that mr. [male] . returning to his suite in the middle of lunch in order to find a paper dealing with the subject he was discussing with his guest . the architect of his new hotel , was aware of a murmur of voices behind the closed door of his bedroom . recognising the accents of his son in law . he breathed an oath and charged in , he objected to archie wandering at large about his suite .
he had managed it with the utmost dexterity at the merry-go-round . with winning politeness he had assisted genevieve on her wooden steed . and then , as the machinery began to work , had grasped [female] 's arm and led her at a rapid walk out into the sunlight . [female] 's last glimpse of genevieve had been the sight of her amazed and offended face as it whizzed round the corner . while the steam melodeon drowned protests with a spirited plunge into [male] 's ragtime band ' .
five minutes later welch , enjoying a sound beauty sleep , began to be possessed of a vague idea that somebody was trying to murder him . his subsequent struggles for life partially woke him . and enabled him to see dimly that two figures were standing by his bed , `` yes ? '' he murmured sleepily , turning over on to his side again , and preparing to doze off . the shaking continued , this was too much , `` look here , '' said he fiercely , sitting up .
the engagement is generally announced at a luncheon given by the parents of the prospective bride . this is usually a small affair , only fifteen or twenty of the most intimate friends of the engaged `` couple '' being invited . it is one of the customs of engagement luncheons that all the guests shall be tremendously surprised at the news . and great care should be taken to aid them in carrying out this tradition . on the invitations , for example , should be written some misleading phrase .
it was in the year of our lord 1629 that mynheer wouter [female] was appointed governor of the province of nieuw nederlandts . under the commission and control of their high mightinesses the lords states general of [location] . and the privileged [location] company , with all his reflective habits . he never made up his mind on a subject . his adherents accounted for this by the astonishing magnitude of his ideas .
[male] had been looking straight out before him with those fine blue eyes of his . there had been just a touch of sternness in his attitude . a stranger , coming into the room at that moment . would have said that here was a girl trying to coax her blunt , straightforward , military father into some course of action of which his honest nature disapproved . he might have been posing for a statue of rectitude .
claire was querulous at times , and always a little too apt to take offence . he had never been able to talk to her with that easy freedom that [female] invited . talking to [female] was like talking to an attractive version of oneself . it was a thing to be done with perfect confidence . without any of that apprehension which claire inspired lest the next remark might prove the spark to cause an explosion .
no , [male] could not come , there was no help there , and [male] . the other son , ten years older than [male] . alas , [male] had gone forth from the homestead to fight his way in the great city ! `` mother , '' he had said , `` when i make a million dollar i '' ll come home , till then good-bye , and he had gone .
oh , talk , talk , talk ! i have had enough . see here , young lady , i offered to pay all your expenses abroad for a year . you did not seem to appreciate it -- well , the trustees of the institute are now to give doctor [male] a year abroad . how do you like that ? splendid , just what he needs ! doctor [male] told me in [location] that [location] always kills its big men with routine .
now she had got a start , and she went on and told me all about the good place . she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing . forever and ever , so i did not think much of it , but i never said so . i asked her if she reckoned [female] would go there . and she said not by a considerable sight , i was glad about that .
likewise , i invited his consideration of the fact . which was not to be gainsaid either , that many men very much less elaborated than i in girth customarily ate very much more than i did . i recalled , offhand , sundry conspicuous examples of this sort . i believe i mentioned one or two such , for instance . now , there was mr. [male] , the [male] appetite .
this is its simple and exact meaning -- that is to say , its restricted . its fettered meaning ; but there are ways by which you can set it free . so that it can soar away , as on the wings of the morning . and never be at rest , you can hang any word you please to its tail . and make it mean anything you want to .
in 1886 a presidential succession law was passed , whereby on the death of the president and the vice-president the order of succession shall be the secretary of state . the secretary of the [organization] , the secretary of war . the attorney general , the postmaster general , and the secretaries of the navy and of the interior . this gives the secretary of agriculture an extremely remote and rarefied chance at the presidency . still , he should be just as faithful to his trust as he would be if he were nearer the throne .
in this trim we rode safely enough for forty eight hours . the ship proving herself an excellent sea boat in many respects . and shipping no water of any consequence , at the end of this period . however , the gale had freshened into a hurricane , and our after -- sail split into ribbons . bringing [location] so much in the trough of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas .
it was at these times that he especially wished he might be allowed to view the `` rushes . '' he not only wished to assure himself for baird 's sake that the piece would be acceptably serious . but he wished , with a quite seemly curiosity , to view his own acting on the screen . it occurred to him that he had been acting a long time without a glimpse of himself . but baird had been singularly firm in this matter .
it was the sinking clampherdown heaved up her battered side . and carried a million pounds in steel , to the cod and the corpse fed conger eel . and the scour of the channel tide . it was the crew of the clampherdown stood out to sweep the sea . on a cruiser won from an ancient foe .
no sooner had he expressed the wish than mr. [male] 's neck curved round through the window . and with three words to the chauffeur he had deflected the course of the taxi . [male] had an almost boyish curiosity about his edifice . he would go and give it a glance at the oddest moments . and just now he had a swift and violent desire to behold it .
the ensuing five years should be devoted to the peculiar orthography of the english language . then put in three years with the dumb bells , sand bags . slung shots and tomahawk , in my own journalistic experience i have found more cause for regret over my neglect of this branch than anything else . i usually keep on my desk during a heated campaign , a large paper weight . weighing three or four pounds , and in several instances i have found that i could feed that to a constant reader of my valuable paper instead of a retraction .
yards and yards of muslin she poured on to it . never had there been so much muslin nor that so exquisitely fine , it went to her heart to [female] it . but there was no time for minor considerations ; every atom of that evidence must be purged by fire . the princess would certainly not write and say that she had left some eyebrows and a hundred yards of muslin behind her . for , knowing what she did , it would be to her interests as well as mrs quantock 's that those properties should vanish .
there was a pervading , anxious hush -- at least what stood very well for a hush in that house . it was believed by many that the opposition was cowed , and that there would be no more obstruction . no more noise , that was an error , presently the president entered by the distant door to the right . followed by vice-president fuchs , and the two took their way down past the polish benches toward the tribune . instantly the customary storm of noises burst out , and rose higher and higher , and wilder and wilder .
every religion , apart from open devil worship . must appeal to a virtue or the pretence of a virtue . but a virtue , generally speaking , does some good to everybody , it is therefore necessary to distinguish among the people it was meant to benefit those whom it does benefit . modern broad mindedness benefits the rich ; and benefits nobody else . it was meant to benefit the rich ; and meant to benefit nobody else , and if you think this unwarranted .
he wheeled round from the window . and transferred his gaze from the view to his sister marion . losing by the action , for the view was a joy to the eye . which his sister marion was not , he was a nasty little man to hold despotic sway over such a paradise . a goblin in fairyland , somewhat below the middle height .
if jill 's vision of brookport as a wintery southend was not entirely fulfilled . neither was [female] picture of it as an earthly paradise . at the right time of the year , like most of the summer resorts on the south shore of long island . it is not without its attractions ; but january is not the month which most people would choose for living in it . it presented itself to jill on first acquaintance in the aspect of a wind-swept railroad station .
what i mean to say is , you are on the map , you have a sporting chance . whereas [female] ... well , just go over to england and try wooing an earl 's daughter whom you have only met once . and then without an introduction ; whose brother 's hat you have smashed beyond repair . whose family wishes her to marry some other man : who wants to marry some other man herself . and not the same other man , but another other man ; who is closely immured in a mediaeval castle .
and behold , they were glad they had gone into savagery . for they had gained something ; they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife . they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable , they were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort . no , they practised cautiously , after supper , with right fair success . and so they spent a jubilant evening , they were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the six nations .
selms went back to his pile of pelts . there were several sheep skins and some cow hides , but only one coon skin -- the one he had that moment bought . selms himself , in after years . used to tell this story as a great joke , one of the boys occasional pastimes was to climb holliday 's hill and roll down big stones .
it suggested amiability in the man who had recently possessed it . it suggested also a mild contempt for public opinion . which is always a sign of superior mentality and advanced years . i began to draw a mental portrait of the old man . he was a family lawyer .
bindle showed great concern at his curious inability to keep with the others . and suggested retiring from the contest ; but this mr. [male] would not hear of . to help matters he beat time with his hand . but as his vocal attitude was one of contemplation of the ceiling . generally with closed eyes , he very frequently hit [female] on the head .
wife : hurry up and finish that paper . we will never get along in this person if we do not begin earlier than we did last night . husband : well , suppose we did not get along in it . that would suit me all right , wife : if you do not want me to read it to you . just say so ... if it 's so far over your head , just say so .
in this last chapter of our short story i will venture to run rapidly over a few months so as to explain how the affairs of bowick arranged themselves up to the end of the current year . i can not pretend that the reader shall know , as he ought to be made to know . the future fate and fortunes of our personages . they must be left still struggling , but then is not such always in truth the case . even when the happy marriage has been celebrated ? -- even when , in the course of two rapid years .
that 's how it comes about that the first results are often so contradictory and conflicting . sometimes the poll is badly arranged and the scrutineers are unable to see properly just how the ballots are being marked and they count up the liberals and conservatives in different ways . often , too , a voter makes his mark so hurriedly and carelessly that they have to pick it out of the ballot box and look at it to see what it is . i suppose that may have been why it was that in mariposa the results came out at first in such a conflicting way . perhaps that was how it was that the first reports showed that [male] drone the independent candidate was certain to win .
the selected paper was laid aside , and the others thrown upon the floor . the investigator being further requested to write on as many different pieces of paper as contained the names . and the relation of the spirits bearing them . supposing the names written were [male] , [male] , and [male] . being , respectively , the investigator 's mother , father , and brother .
let [location] look over her shoulder and read some more of the wicked woman 's confessions . the countess turned on a few more pages and prepared to write up yesterday 's events . tuesday , june 23rd , she said to herself , now what happened ? acclaimed with enthusiasm outside the palace -- how do you spell `` enthusiasm ' ? '' she bit the end of her pencil and pondered .
they may not be aware that they so demand . but it is nevertheless a fact that , unless the chorus come on at these fixed intervals . the audience 's interest sags . the raciest farce scenes can not hold them , nor the most tender love passages . they want the gurls , the whole gurls .
it would be an endless task to enumerate all the nations which practised polygamy . we shall , therefore , only mention a few , where the practice seemed to vary something from the common method . the ancient sabaans are not only said to have had a plurality , but even a community of wives . a thing strongly inconsistent with that spirit of jealousy which prevails among men in most countries where polygamy is allowed . the ancient germans were so strict monogamists , that they reckoned it a species of polygamy for a woman to marry a second husband even after the death of the first .
the reeves building was as fireproof as a rock and as efficient as a typewriter . fourteen stories of yellow pressed brick . with clean , upright , unornamented lines , it was filled with the offices of lawyers . doctors , agents for machinery . for emery wheels , for wire fencing , for mining stock .
he had won it a year before . and since then had confined himself to smoking cigars as long as walking sticks and appearing nightly in a vaudeville sketch entitled . `` a fight for honor , '' his reminiscences were being published in a sunday paper . it was this that gave smith the idea of publishing kid brady 's autobiography in peaceful moments . an idea which won the kid 's whole hearted gratitude .
and a middle-aged woman emerges ( all women are middle-aged when emerging from the dentist 's office ) . looking as if she were playing the big emotional scene in [female] ferguson . a wisp of hair waves dissolutely across her forehead between her eyes . her face is pale , except for a slight inflammation at the corners of her mouth . and in her eyes is that far-away look of one who has been face to face with life .
mrs. [female] not only brought up jessie carefully . but very slowly , so that at seventeen she was still a clever schoolgirl and quite in the background of the little literary circle of unimportant celebrities which [female] plantagenet ', adorned . mrs. [male] knew bechamel 's reputation of being a dangerous man . but then bad men are not bad women , and she let him come to her house to show she was not afraid . she took no account of jessie .
jellicoe , who was appearing in society supported by a stick . looked meaningly at [female] , and giggled , receiving in answer a stony stare . [male] had informed [male] of the details of his interview with mr . [male] at the `` white boar , '' and [male] . after a momentary splutter of wrath against the practical joker .
[female] watched till dawn , sometimes he started up to walk to and fro . beating his bosom , and wringing his hands in agony . [male] he threw himself prostrate in the stupor of despair . at the first carol of birds in the forest . sleep surprised his weary senses , and the peace of the innocent settled upon his features .
there was a large room at the back of the shop . and here oceans of hot tea and tons of toast were consumed . the staff of [male] 's consisted of mr. [male] . late sergeant in a line regiment . six foot three , disposition amiable , left leg cut off above the knee by a spirited fuzzy in the last soudan war .
they were shown also in all these paintings as graceful and beautiful in figure . but in those days when the pocahontas girls went barefooted till the age of eighty nine years . chewed tobacco , kept lent all winter and then ate a brace of middle-aged men for easter . the figure must have been affected by this irregularity of meals . unless the pocahontas of the present day has fallen off sadly in her carriage and beauty .
`` not at home , miladi , '' said the man . in the same tone , at that moment mrs. toff came running through the long [female] to the carriage door . the house was built round a quadrangle , and all the ground floor of the front and of one of the sides consisted of halls . passages , and a billiard room , mrs. toff must have been watching very closely or she could hardly have known that lady alice was there . she came out and stood beside the carriage , and leaning in , whispered her fears and unhappinesses , oh !
he broke off and agitated the sidewalk to a bumpy gallop , `` daggone ! '' he muttered , half aloud , they would all be there . the old crowd , the crowd to which , by right of [organization] . sold long since , and the portrait of the officer in gray over the mantel . [male] should have belonged , but that crowd had grown up together into a tight little set as gradually as the girls
grave historians have debated for centuries the pretensions of [female] to the title . `` the virgin queen , '' and it is utterly impossible to dispose of the issue in a note . however , the weight of opinion appears to be in the negative , many and great were the difficulties attending the marriage of a protestant princess in those troublous times . and [female] finally announced that she would become wedded to the english nation . and she wore a ring in token thereof until her death .
he went along the same path , and soon came to an enclosure . but no sooner had he entered it than he saw that he must have mistaken his way . this was not the right place , there was no statue in the middle . he was about to turn away , when he saw something that made him start . it was a low pedestal in the centre .
more table turning in the evening , person said last night was in a measure successful . and they ought to sit again , cummings came in , and seemed interested , i had the gas lighted in the drawing room . got the steps , and repaired the cornice , which has been a bit of an eyesore to me . in a fit of unthinkingness—if i may use such an expression . —i gave the floor over the parlour .
what this dreadful matter was , the reader will be informed , after we have first related the many preceding steps which produced it . and those will be the subject of the following book , there are a set of religious . or rather moral writers , who teach that virtue is the certain road to happiness . and vice to misery , in this world . a very wholesome and comfortable doctrine , and to which we have but one objection .
although many of [location] 's foremost boxers have been persons whom one would not care to know socially . yet much fun and pleasure can be had out of the `` manly art '' if practised in a gentlemanly manner , `` boxing parties '' are generally held in the evening . the ballroom of one 's home can be pleasantly decorated for the occasion . with a square ring roped off in the centre surrounded by seats for the ladies and gentlemen who come as invited guests .
his second start was favoured with greater luck , and he found himself out in the [male] . and presently in the cool air of the night , with the stars shining down on him . had those silent stars ever shone down on a more broken hearted man ? had the cool air of the night ever fanned a more fevered brow ? ah , yes , or , rather , ah no , there was not a very large entry for the mixed foursomes competition . in my experience there seldom is , men are as a rule idealists .
he is so self willed , he is cock sure that the correct turning is the second on the right . and nothing will persuade him that it is the third . he is positive he can get across the road in time . and will not be convinced until he sees the cart smashed up , then he is very apologetic . it is true , but of what use is that ? as he is usually of the size and strength of a young bull .
the atrocities introduced into this country by the tories and indians caused general sullivan to go out against the measly enemy . whip him near elmira , and destroy the fields of corn and villages in the genesee country . where the indian women were engaged in farming while their men folks attended to the massacre industry . the weak point with the americans seemed to be lack of a suitable navy . a navy costs money , and the colonists were poor .
but he was as insensible to their caresses as any other fish would have been . he had some scales on his body . which dropped off by degrees ; but his skin was as hard and rough as shagreen . he stayed at home nine years . without recovering his speech or his reason : he then disappeared again .
with each generation the difference between the two families became more acute . they differed on every possible point , they wore different tartans . sat under different ministers , drank different brands of whisky . and upheld different doctrines in regard to eternal punishment . to add to the feud the mcwhinuses had grown rich , while the mcshamuses had become poor .
lord [male] hurried up to town . and took a room for himself at an hotel in jermyn street . he would not go to scumberg 's , as he did not wish to mix his private life with that of his brother . that afternoon he went across , and was told that his brother would see him at three o'clock the next day . then he interrogated mrs. [female] as to his brother 's condition .
so much for one european fashion , every country has its own ways . it may interest the reader to know how they `` put horses to '' on the continent , the man stands up the horses on each side of the thing that projects from the front end of the wagon . and then throws the tangled mess of gear forward through a ring . and hauls it aft , and passes the other thing through the other ring and hauls it aft on the other side of the other horse .
in his council he presided with great state and solemnity . he sat in a huge chair of solid oak . hewn in the celebrated forest of the hague . fabricated by an experienced timmerman of amsterdam , and curiously carved about the arms and feet into exact imitations of gigantic [organization] 's claws . instead of a scepter , he swayed a long turkish pipe .
and so they bear with dance and song . and crimson foil and green , they wearily sit , and grimly long for the transformation scene . four subjects , and all of them male . to borria doubled the knee , they were once on a far larger scale . but he would eaten the balance , you see ( `` scale '' and `` balance '' is punning .
these upheavals had the effect on [female] of making her feel curiously linked to the firm . on ordinary days work was work . but on these occasions of storm and stress it was a fight . and she looked on every member of the little band grouped under the banner of [female] rendal as a brother in arms . for [female] , while the battle raged , she would have done anything .
to which dr. [female] on the other side added , like a chorus . `` pulverem olympicum , '' to all of which tomlinson answered never a word . but looked steadily first at one and then at the other , dr. [male] said afterwards that the penetration of tomlinson was wonderful . and that it was excellent to see how [male] tried in vain to draw him . and [male] said afterwards that the way in which tomlinson quietly refused to be led on by [male] was delicious .
the germans remember the sabbath day to keep it holy , by abstaining from work , as commanded . we keep it holy by abstaining from work . as commanded , and by also abstaining from play , which is not commanded , perhaps we constructively break the command to rest . because the resting we do is in most cases only a name . and not a fact , then she rose -- and all the congregation stood while she walked down the aisle .
after that , when thoroughly braced up , they rise , whistle the dogs to heel . set the guns on half cock . and go `` on the shoot '' -- another way of saying that every man plucks off his cap , `` shies '' it up with all his might , and pops it on the fly with no . 5 , 6 , or two shot , according to what he is loaded for .
i went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash hopper , and started for the kitchen . when i got a little ways i heard the dim hum of a spinning wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again . and then i knowed for certain i wished i was dead -- for that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world . i went right along , not fixing up any particular plan , but just trusting to providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come . for i would noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouth if i left it alone .
luckily , he was prepared with an offering of a suitable nature . he had meant to enjoy it for yet a few days . and then to give it to teacher , she was such a sensible person about presents . one might give her one 's most cherished possession with a brave and cordial heart . for on each friday afternoon she returned the gifts she had received during the week .
mr. [male] 's relief was overwhelming . if lord dreever 's statement was correct and [male] had really succeeded in winning [male] 's affection . this would indeed be a rescue at the eleventh hour , it was with a nunc dimittis air that he felt for his cigar case . and extended it toward the detective , a cigar from his own private case was with him a mark of supreme favor and good-will . a sort of accolade which he bestowed only upon the really meritorious few .
the difference is that the heavy father , in his heavy way . is a democrat , he does not urge a thing merely because to his fancy it should be done . but , because `` everybody does it , '' the conventional authority does claim some popular mandate . the unconventional authority does not , the puritan who forbids soldiers on sunday is at least expressing puritan opinion . not merely his own opinion , he is not a despot .
the skipper had grumbled a bit at first , but had given way . he always spoiled the girl -- with the result that [male] found himself sitting on the deck of the tug engaged in the complicated process of restoring his faculties to the normal . in a sort of dream he perceived mr. [male] rise to the surface some feet away . adjust his derby hat , and , after one long look of dislike in his direction . swim off rapidly to intercept a five which was floating under the stern of a near by skiff .
now , however , after five minutes of solitude on the depressing platform of market blandings station . he was what the spiritualists call a sensitive subject . he had reached that depth of gloom and bodily discomfort when a sudden smile has all the effect of strong liquor and good news administered simultaneously . warming the blood and comforting the soul , and generally turning the world from a bleak desert into a land flowing with milk and honey . it is not too much to say that he reeled before joan 's smile .
it is a solemn business . this getting laughs for a living , supposing the people do not laugh . then how are you going to live ? take an act that you have been doing for weeks . every afternoon and every night the audience laughs at exactly the same lines . this goes on night after night , week after week and city after city .
i am glad we met [male] , ', said [male] . `` he 's a good boy , '' she spoke soberly . she was conscious of a curious feeling of affection for the sturdy . weather tanned little man opposite her , the glimpse she had been given of his inner self had somehow made him come alive for her . `` he wants to marry my daughter , '' said lord [location] .
the fireplaces are large and deep , with fierce crooked looking fire dogs , there is constantly a rousing fire . and a huge pot over it , full of [organization] and pork . to which the good woman of the house is always busy in attending , she is a little fat old lady . with blue eyes and a red face , and wears a huge cap like a sugar loaf . ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons , her dress is of orange colored linsey woolsey .
as the train stopped , we got out on the right hand side of the line . the engine stood panting impatiently under the red light , which changed to green as i looked at it . as the train moved on with increasing speed , the detective counted the carriages . and noted down the number , it was now dark , with the thin crescent of the moon hanging in the western sky throwing a weird half light on the shining metals . the rear lamps of the train disappeared around a curve .
it is a melancholy fact ; but it must be related . that mr pinch 's sister was not at all ugly , on the contrary . she had a good face ; a very mild and prepossessing face . and a pretty little figure -- slight and short , but remarkable for its neatness . there was something of her brother , much of him indeed .
ten miles south , the leading aec disaster truck stopped behind the six strand fence blocking the range road . two men with wire cutters . jumped from the truck and snipped the twanging wires . the metal `` keep out '' sign banged to the ground and was kicked aside . the truck rolled through the gap and the men swung aboard .
but what is this ? instead of `` showing up '' the parsons , are we indulging in maudlin praises of that monstrous black coated race ? o saintly francis , lying at rest under the turf ; o [male] . and [male] , and willy , friends of my youth ! o noble and dear old elias , how should he who knows you not respect you and your calling ? may this pen never write a pennyworth again , if it ever casts ridicule upon either !
ah , who can depict the secret chagrin of an old maid who sees pass by in useless monotony her dark . loveless , despairing days , without hope even of some event of personal interest . while about her moves the busy whirl of happier creatures whose life has but one goal . who feel emotions and tendernesses , and who look upon her simply as an obscure accessory in the household 's affairs ! they all loved her , of course .
`` well , i think that that is all , mr. [male] , '' chirruped the editor . he was a little man with a long neck and large pince nez . and he always chirruped , `` you understand the general lines on which i think the paper should be conducted ? '' the sub editor nodded , mr. [male] made him tired . sometimes he made him more tired than at other times .
with cards and dice , and dress and friends . my savings are complete ; i light the candle at both ends . and thus make both ends meet , a cowardly fellow having spoken impertinently to a gentleman . received a violent box of the ear , he demanded whether that was meant in earnest . `` yes , sir , '' replied the other , without hesitation , the coward turned away .
philip received the reprimand with good grace . and bowed , first smiling at his brother , and then at his mother , but mazarin saw from the corner of his eye that a group was about to be formed in the corner of the room . and that the duc d'anjou , with the comte [male] guiche . and the chevalier [male] lorraine , prevented from talking aloud , might say , in a whisper . what it was not convenient should be said , he was beginning , then , to dart at them glances full of mistrust and uneasiness .
this parent establishment of germans began its work fifteen years ago . strangers , poor , and unencouraged ; it owns 15,000 acres of land now . and raises grain and fruit , and makes wines . and manufactures all manner of things , and has native apprentices in its shops . and sends them forth able to read and write , and also well equipped to earn their living by their trades .
the whole arm seemed red hot , and the broken bone grated in the joint , sending out shoots of the essence of pain . his other arm was pinioned against the wall , and gino had trampled in behind the stove and was kneeling on his legs . for the space of a minute he yelled and yelled with all the force of his lungs . then this solace was denied him , the other hand . moist and strong , began to close round his throat , vivid pictures were dancing through the pain .
poor [female] is buried here tho once he was both hale and stout . death stretched him on his bitter bier . in another world he hops about , received of [male] his borrowed earth july 4th 1673 . here lies [location] 's premier baron , patiently awaiting the last trump . here lies a cardinal who wrought both good and evil in his time , the good he did was good for naught not so the evil .
we see certainly , that the men , for the most part . can not tarry at home , and will be going hither or thither to take the air . or for his pleasure , or to smoke a pipe of tabacco . as is shew would you in the fifth confession ; if then , in the mean while . the woman , through occasion of some customers in the shop .
as paul looked he saw distinctly that his son 's fraudulent imitation of his father 's personal appearance had become deteriorated in many respects since that unhappy night when he had last seen it . it was then a copy , faultlessly accurate in every detail . it was now almost a caricature , a libel ! the complexion was nearly sallow , with the exception of the nose . which had rather deepened in colour , the skin was loose and flabby .
however , i am now emerging from my doleful dumps , with the reflection that . after all , it is contrary to common sense to drain the cup of misery to the dregs for so totally inadequate a cause as the ficklety of any feminine ! the public will be astounded at the news ( which came with the perfect novelty of a surprise upon this insignificant self ) . that i have ceased to be the cherished guest beneath the hired scottish roof of mister leofric allbutt innett and his bucksome lady . one fine september morning , when i was accoutring myself in order to go out and hunt the [male] ( n.b . a genuine local scotticism for individuals belonging to the rabbit genius ) .
after the usual dance in the church of [female] maria . before the image of the glorious [female] , [female] caught up a tambourine . well furnished with bells , and having cleared a wide circle around her with pirouettes of exceeding lightness . she sang a hymn to the patroness of the day . it was the admiration of all who heard her .
the officers rode up and down the column encouraging the more active with words of praise . and the laggards with blows from the flat of their swords . all the time from over the wood in front of them there came the tremendous roar of the battle . as if all the rivers on earth had united in one gigantic cataract . booming and crashing in a mighty fall , like the spray of the cataract was the long veil of smoke which rose high over the trees .
and then , across the street , his soured eye fell upon his true comrade and best friend leaning against a picket fence and holding desultory converse with [male] . an attractive member of the friday afternoon dancing class . that hated organization of which [female] and penrod were both members . [female] was a shy little girl ; but penrod had a vague understanding that [female] considered her two brown pig tails beautiful . [location] , [male] had never told his love .
besides , cinderella dear , we should not quite mean it . this excellent advice , we have grown accustomed to these gew gaws . and we should miss them in spite of our knowledge of their trashiness . you , your palace and your little gold crown . i , my mountebank 's cap .
he discarded the theory as repellent . and yet there must be a reason for his depression , today of all days . as [organization] had pointed out , he had everything to make him happy . popular as he was in [location] , this was the first piece of his to be produced in [location] . and there was no doubt that it was a success of unusual dimensions .
[male] was a county man . he had only played once for his county , it was true . but that did not matter , he had passed the barrier which separates the second class bat from the first class . and the bank welcomed him with awe . county men did not come their way every day .
hence the spectacle in the new spanish and portuguese world , as in the old . of men and women who are at once journalists . novelists , dramatists , politicians , soldiers . poets and what not else , such a versatility , often joined to a literary prolixity . no doubt serves to lower the artistic worth of works produced under such conditions .
in those days i could have told you what granite was made of . in those days i had over my bed a map of the geological strata of the district . in different colours like a chocolate macaroon . and in those days i knew my way to the geological museum . as a botanist i never really shone , but two of [location] joined an open air course and used to be taken expeditions into kew gardens and such places .
3 , practise on some soft and smooth ground , for example . on a lawn ; the one next door for choice . a muddy road , although sufficiently soft , is not recommended -- the drawbacks are obvious , 4 . choose a secluded place for practising , it may at first sight appear somewhat selfish to deprive your neighbours of a gratuitous performance which would be certain to amuse them . nevertheless , be firm , 5 , get someone to hold you on , engage a friend in an interesting conversation while you mount your bicycle .
she spoke no good of the girls . and the customer foresaw feminine trouble in his household with those same young ladies . having a few moments to himself before she resumed . he worked himself into a great passion with the ungrateful hussies who were about to treat their kind old father in so scandalous a manner . but presently recollecting that they were as yet in the condition of your sister .
the newberrys belonged to the class of people whose one aim in the summer is to lead the simple life . mr. [male] himself said that his one idea of a vacation was to get right out into the [male] . and put on old clothes , and just eat when he felt like it . this was why he had built castel casteggio . it stood about forty miles from the city .
he sprang toward the door , but she was before him . a moment later a young man with pallid face . set mouth and tragic eyes was flying toward the indian mound upon a swift wheel . and in the school room , prone upon the floor . a girl lay in a death like swoon .
and the poet rummaged in his pocket , and drew out a piece of brass . [location] , quadrangular , about a line in thickness . and an inch and a half in length . but scarcely had this little piece of brass seen the light . than the poet appeared to have committed an imprudence , and made a movement to put it back again in his pocket .
she could not understand the amount of offence which was rankling in [female] 's bosom . it had not consisted only in the words spoken , but her looks in the man 's presence had conveyed the same accusation . so that it could be seen and understood by the man himself . [male] , with an effort , had gone on with her play . determined that no one should suppose her to be cowed by her grand sister in law .
still i believe he must have been pretty popular with the ladies , because i can not think of him to this day without wanting to punch his head . at the church sociables he used to hop around among them . chipping and chirping like a dicky bird picking up seed ; and he was a great hand to play the piano . and sing saddish , sweetish songs to them , always said the smooth thing and said it easy . never had to choke and swallow to fetch it up , never stepped through his partner 's dress when he began to dance .
to betty everything was new and strange , her previous acquaintance with the metropolis had not been extensive . mr. [male] 's home . or , rather , the house which he owned in [location] . was on the outskirts of [location] , and it was there that she had lived when she was not paying visits . occasionally , during horse show week , or at some other time of festivity .
at this vengeful deed on the part of the camel all the other animals became furious . a full grown goat cracker swung himself against the camel and knocked it . in turn , from its stem ; and in falling on the ground it broke its hump off . then a lion cracker knocked the goat down , and an elephant knocked a cat down . and soon the whole tree was in a violent commotion , the animals fought with each other so desperately that before long the entire treeful of animal crackers had fallen to the ground .
`` bow wow , '' barked [male] . and that meant he would do as his master had told him . for several days after this nothing happened in the pigs pen except that they were washed off with the hose now and then , to clean them of mud and make them cool . once in a while the farmer would take a corn cob and scratch the back of mr. or mrs .
he moped to school gloomy and sad . and took his flogging , along with [male] harper . for playing hookey the day before , with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles . then he betook himself to his seat . rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands .
bradstreet , author , wrote a book in which he described your bank account and told how you paid your bills . his complimentary comments are highly valued , [organization] , eugene , a seller of damaged goods who got away with it without being fined or driven out of business . brown , [male] , an [location] who helped start the civil war by espousing the cause of the negro . this resulted in his body moulding in the grave . brown , [male] , an englishman who reversed the usual procedure of life by springing into print when young .
the contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh , his forehead was lofty and very fair . his nose a snub ; his eyes large . heavy , glassy , and meaningless , about the mouth there was more to be observed . the lips were gently protruded , and rested the one upon the other , after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any . even the most complex , combination of human features , conveying so entirely , and so singly .
besides , his coming events cast such peculiar and very unpleasant shadows before . that he preferred to keep out of the grim presence of such shady men . and for all after time to bask him only in the sunshine of smiling women . `` pizon his first wife , '' would he ? well , he could have taken that `` pizon '' with tolerable composure from the lips of lovely woman . but to receive it from the mumbling mouth of a skinny old man .
my men ate up all the stuff , all i saved for my self was the white meat an half a mince pie . it certainly tastes good in the field , of course we aint in nobodies field . thats a military expreshun , i cant explain it . i got to quit now an post a guard , at the same time ill post this letter to you . thats a joke mable , im sorry this letter cant be longer but as a man rises in the army he gets less an less time to hisself , olive oil .
they prefer albumen and starch and nitrogen to huckleberry pie and doughnuts . they wo not drink water out of a tap . they wo not eat sardines out of a can , they wo not use oysters out of a pail . they wo not drink milk out of a glass . they are afraid of alcohol in any shape .
but the first essential of a quiet funeral is a willing corpse . and i am still sitting up and taking nourishment , there are two things you never want to pay any attention to . abuse and flattery , the first can not harm you and the second can not help you . some men are like yellow dogs -- when you are coming toward them they will jump up and try to lick your hands . and when you are walking away from them they will sneak up behind and snap at your heels .
curiously enough , a sort of lair or nest , very soft and comfortable , was thus made ready for our religious humbug . just as he wanted it worst ; for in these days he was but seedy . he heard something of [male] . i do not know how ; and on the 5th of may , 1832 , he called on him . very quickly the poor fellow recognized the long bearded prophetical humbug as all that he claimed to be .
at last i made bold to ask him to tell [location] who he was . `` an angel , '' he said , quite simply , and set another bird free and clapped his hands and made it fly away . a kind of awe fell upon [location] when we heard him say that . and we were afraid again ; but he said we need not be troubled . there was no occasion for [location] to be afraid of an angel .
with a variety of tortuous embellishments about the pockets . invented by the artist to do honour to the day , the miserable augustus no longer felt strongly even on the subject of jinkins . he had not strength of mind enough to do it . `` let him come , '' he had said , in answer to miss pecksniff . when she urged the point , let him come !
at first the city boys and girls were much interested in watching [female] posts and fence pickets . but they soon tired of it , and even jim decided it was not the right sort of sport for cities . but one day the butcher asked jim to ride one of his horses into the country . to a pasture that had been engaged , and jim eagerly consented , he had been longing for a horseback ride . and to make it seem like old times he took his lasso with him .
this , taken in conjunction with the fact that if the worst came to the worst he had . at any rate , won a medal by having got into the final , cheered sheen . if only [male] had appeared he would have been perfectly contented , sheen got his full measure of applause this time . his victories in the preliminary bouts had won him favour with the spectators . `` go it , ripton , '' cried a voice from near the door .
likenesses of person and person flanked the windows with an [location] flag above them . and a series of battleships and army scenes beneath . the inventor 's taste , however , had not run entirely to patriotic subjects . for scattered along the walls , where shelves sagged with their burden of oilcans . putty , nails and fishing tackle .
[female] the conqueror now disarmed the city of [location] . and tipping a number of the nobles , got them to wait on him . he rewarded his norman followers , however , with the contraband estates of the conquered . and thus kept up his conking for years after peace had been declared . but the people did not forget that they were there first , and so , while [male] was in normandy .
next morning brought good news -- our trunks had arrived from [location] at last . let this be a warning to the reader , the germans are very conscientious . and this trait makes them very particular , therefore if you tell a german you want a thing done immediately . he takes you at your word . he thinks you mean what you say .
la fleur bore his fall like a french christian . saying neither more nor less upon it , than diable , so presently got up . and came to the charge again astride his bidet , beating him up to it as he would have beat his drum . the bidet flew from one side of the road to the other . then back again , -- then this way , then that way , and in short .
they began , i think , with the `` endless chain '' of letters of appeal , you may remember the device . for it was all popular in clerical circles some ten or fifteen years ago . you got a number of people to write each of them three letters asking for ten cents from three each of their friends and asking each of them to send on three similar letters . three each from three each , and three each more from each , do you observe the wonderful ingenuity of it ?
then mr , [male] remembered , [female] had an aunt resident about three miles from the school . whom he was accustomed to visit occasionally on sunday afternoons during the term . he felt for his bunch of keys . and made his way to the shed , [male] shambling behind at an interval of two yards , mr . [male] unlocked the door , and there on the floor was the clue !
nothing had happened for a long time -- for such a long time that . in spite of the ferment within him . mr pickering almost began to believe that nothing would happen , the moon shone with unutterable calm . the crickets and the tree frogs performed their interminable duet . apparently unconscious that they were attacking it in different keys .
he was still not quite sure in his mind whether he was playing the role of a penitent or a king cophetua . but in either character he might have anticipated a little temporary coldness . which it would have been his easy task to melt , but he had never expected to be looked at as if he were a specimen in a museum . and that was how he was feeling now , jill was not looking at him—she was inspecting him . examining him , and he chafed under the process .
[female] said nothing ; she was beyond speech . she stood there wide-eyed and silent among the ruins of her little air castle , the old man patted her hand affectionately . he was pleased at her docility , it was the right attitude . becoming in one of her high rank , so little did ted brady realize at first the true complexity of the situation that he was inclined . when he heard of the news , to treat the crisis in the jaunty .
never shall i forget the sudden flash of hope which shone in his dark eyes when he saw a comrade burst into the room . or the look of despair which followed as he understood that i had come not to change his fate but to share it . you can think how amazed these people were when i hurled myself into their presence . my pursuers had crowded in behind me and choked the doorway . so that all further flight was out of the question , it is at such instants that my nature asserts itself .
i worked more than half an hour before i got him to change the subject . and even then an outside matter did it for me . this was a something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a small hill . a red glow , a good way off , that 's a fire , ', said i . fires interested me considerably , because i was getting a good deal of an insurance business started .
the red-faced man at the next table eyed them as they went out . leaving behind them a waiter who clutched totteringly for support at the back of a chair . on the boardwalk at [location] , that much enduring seashore resort which has been the birthplace of so many musical plays . there stands an all day and all night restaurant , under the same management and offering the same hospitality as the one in [location] circle at which jill had taken her first meal on arriving in [location] . at least , its hospitality is noisy during the waking and working hours of the day .
no , returned hoppy , i have not , in fact i have not got an office to be to . that 's what bothers me so like thunder , i have looked at plenty of offices advertised as for rent for legal firms . but i will be hanged if i can find anything suitable . your barristers over here have not as good accommodations as we give obsolete papers at home . our pigeon holes are palatial in comparison with your office suites .
there are misguided people who complain that cricket is becoming a business more than a game . as if that were not the most fortunate thing that could happen , when it ceases to be a mere business and becomes a religious ceremony . it will be a sign that the millennium is at hand . the person who regards cricket as anything less than a business is no fit companion . gentle reader , for the likes of you and me .
it was a rather startling surprise to everybody . but it was effective in the matter of its purpose . so the conversation flowed on instead of perishing , there was some talk about the perils of the sea . and a landsman delivered himself of the customary nonsense about the poor mariner wandering in far oceans . tempest tossed , pursued by dangers , every storm blast and thunderbolt in the home skies moving the friends by snug firesides to compassion for that poor mariner .
in the centre of her landaulet sat the lady in black and lavender . chatting pleasantly first with one , then with another of that fortunate few in cutaways who had found their way to speaking distance in the first rush . after a while she glanced around her and beside her with a look of growing annoyance . she yawned and asked the man nearest her if he could not run in somewhere and get her a glass of water . the man apologized in some embarrassment , he could not have moved hand or foot .
`` i will tell you not another word ! '' she cried , with a spasm of terror . then she got out her handkerchief , and seemed as if she would shed tears . after a silence , which he intended to symbolize to her the dropping of a curtain on the scene . he began to talk of other subjects , they were among olives again .
the president began the proceedings by reciting the evidence of daphne 's title . which it now appeared had been put into the hands of the burgomaster and other notables of eswareinmal by the marshal . just before he had gone to meet his sudden end , he then asked . in the name of the whole tribunal , what the present occupants of the throne had to urge in their own defence . if the queen had possessed the legal mind she would have perceived at once that the evidence was merely hearsay .
he wished that old mr. [male] could have been present . he had conceived a great affection for mr. [male] . and registered a mental resolve to lose no time in weaning him from his distressing habit of allowing the office to interfere with his pleasures . he was planning a little trip to the polo grounds . in which mr. [male] , his father .
he had a severe cold , he had a splitting headache . his hands and feet were frozen , his eyes smarted . he was hungry , he was thirsty , he hated cheerful m. feriaud . who had hopped out and was now busy tinkering the engine , a gay provencal air upon his lips . as he had rarely hated any one , even muriel coppin 's brother [male] .
`` how far did you say it was ? '' she demanded of the porter in a tone that seemed . as if by magic , to dry up the fountain of his mirth . `` three mile , mum , '' he replied . making a shuffling movement in the direction of where young [male] stood beside his levers . all unconscious of the splendid joke that had come to cheer his solitude , mrs. [female] .
the scot is always believed , yet he never tells anything but lies . whereas the [male] is never believed , although he never tells a lie . so far as i can judge , if he should say his uncle was a male person . he would probably say it in such a way that nobody would believe it . at the same time the scot could claim that he had a female uncle and not stir a doubt in anybody 's mind .
miss [organization] would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her . but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr. [male] going . she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence . what mr. [male] had learned from the ostler on the subject . being the accumulation of the ostler 's own knowledge .
the bore and his comrades -- for there are usually from two to four on hand . day and night -- mix into the conversation when men come in to see the editors for a moment on business . they hold noisy talks among themselves about politics in particular . and all other subjects in general -- even warming up , after a fashion , sometimes , and seeming to take almost a real interest in what they are discussing . they ruthlessly call an editor from his work with such a remark as .
close at hand , now , was a chance for a blood curdling alpine adventure . close at hand was the snowy mass of the great altels cooling its topknot in the sky and daring [location] to an ascent . i was fired with the idea , and immediately made up my mind to procure the necessary guides . ropes , etc. , and undertake it . i instructed [male] to go to the landlord of the inn and set him about our preparations .
the barman looked from [male] to tippitt , then touching his forehead with a fugitive first finger . and glancing in the direction of [male] , made it clear that another was prepared to support the diagnosis of the young woman at the oil shop . [female] completed the journey on the top of the van . industriously occupied in puffing lamp black through the holes in the roof . his method was to dip the end of the pea puffer into the packet .
wilhelm said he would not go ; if there was danger for her . his place was by her , and there he would remain . then she began to cry again , and it was all so mournful that i wished i had stayed away . there was a knock , now , and [male] came in , fresh and cheery and beautiful . and brought that winy atmosphere of his and changed the whole thing .
it was wildly exhilarating to slide along the edge of the precipices . after this grisly fashion , and look straight down upon that far-off valley which i was describing a while ago . there was no level ground at the kaltbad station . the railbed was as steep as a roof ; i was curious to see how the stop was going to be managed . but it was very simple ; the train came sliding down , and when it reached the right spot it just stopped .
turnbull said nothing , but turned and looked out of the foolish lattice of the little windows . then he said , `` we must have food and sleep first . '' when the last echo of their eluded pursuers had died in the distant uplands . [male] began to unpack the provisions with the easy air of a man at a picnic . he had just laid out the last items , put a bottle of wine on the floor .
the adventuress is like the proverbial cat as regards the number of lives she is possessed of . you never know when she is really dead , most people like to die once and have done with it . but the adventuress , after once or twice trying it , seems to get quite to like it . and goes on giving way to it , and then it grows upon her until she can not help herself . and it becomes a sort of craving with her .
on that night , a year before , the flower of his profession had assembled to do him honor . once between the courses , when he rose , as was his habit . to walk about , he wandered into the drawing room , and , seating himself at the orchestrelle . began to play the beautiful `` flower song '' from [male] . it was a thing i had not seen him do before .
they were standing on the boat deck , leaning over the rail . jill caught her breath , for the first time since disaster had come upon her she was conscious of a rising of her spirits . it is impossible to behold the huge buildings which fringe the harbor of [location] without a sense of expectancy and excitement . there had remained in jill 's mind from childhood memories a vague picture of what she now saw . but it had been feeble and inadequate , the sight of this towering city seemed somehow to blot out everything that had gone before .
besides these , they had a variety of other methods equally ridiculous and unavailing . and of which it would be trifling to give a minute detail . we shall , therefore , just take notice as we go along . that such of either sex as believed themselves forced into love by the power of philtres and charms . commonly had recourse to the same methods to disengage themselves , and break the power of these enchantments .
yes , saith [female] consent to all , and my advice is then to take a little horn . with a sheeps udder , and lay that upon the tipples , for that defends them . and occasions their curing much better and sooner , o what a pleasure it is to hear all the pretty considerations of so many prudent doctresses ! if clement marot might but revive , i am sure he would find here as many doctresses . as ever there were doctors at [location] , but o how happy will this fortunate new father be .
it is curious the attraction the church has always possessed for the marketing classes . person drove them from the temple . but still , in every continental city , they cluster round its outer walls . it makes a charming picture on a sunny morning . the great cathedral with its massive shadow forming the background ; splashed about its feet .
the morning sunlight fell pleasantly on the garden of windles . turning it into the green and amber paradise which nature had intended it to be . a number of the local birds sang melodiously in the undergrowth at the end of the lawn . while others , more energetic , hopped about the grass in quest of worms . bees , mercifully ignorant that , after they had worked themselves to the bone gathering honey .
will was a constant source of anxiety and wonder to the teacher . who often marked him as the scapegoat to carry off the surface sins of sneaking and cowardly pupils . corporal punishment was part of school discipline . and [male] and myself got our share of the rule and rod . through all the centuries , in youth and age .
my children begin now to claim all my attention in different manner from that in which they have been used to receive it . as they are now arrived at that age when it is necessary for them in some measure to become conversant with the world . my [female] is 17 and her sister scarcely a twelvemonth younger , i flatter myself that their education has been such as will not disgrace their appearance in the world . and that they will not disgrace their education i have every reason to beleive . indeed they are sweet girls -- , sensible yet unaffected -- accomplished yet easy -- . lively yet gentle .
the modern englishman , however , is like a man who should be perpetually kept out . for one reason after another , from the house in which he had meant his married life to begin . this man has always desired the divinely ordinary things ; he has married for love . he has chosen or built a small house that fits like a coat . he is ready to be a great grandfather and a local god .
but at any rate evening paper poets had never written facetious verses about their exploits . this crowning degradation had been reserved for the hitherto blameless percy . who , of all the young men of lady [male] 's acquaintance . had till now appeared to have the most scrupulous sense of his position , the most rigid regard for the dignity of his great name . yet , here he was , if the carefully considered reports in the daily press were to be believed .
mr. [male] does not crave notoriety . he seems rather to court seclusion . this is characteristic of the man , see how he walked around all over the state of [location] last week . in the night , too -- in order to evade the crowd . nothing is more pleasing than the sight of a man who has risen by his own unaided effort .
we have no idea whether he is a good boy or not . the marks of his destruction are plain enough , but without knowing his motives we can not pass on his conduct . we were slightly annoyed when he broke the lamp . but perhaps it was no more than pardonable curiosity on his part . perhaps it was wanton , how can we tell ?
the balcony above the portico was positively hung with gaudy chinese lanterns . and there were even some strange sticks and shapes up in one corner that looked suspiciously like fireworks . fireworks in westbourne terrace , what would the neighbours think or do ? between the wall which separates the main road from the terrace and the street front there were no less than four piano organs . playing , it is to be feared , by express invitation .
another sample was smith , the blacksmith 's apprentice . this vast donkey had some pluck , of a slow and sluggish nature . but a soft heart ; at one time he would knock a horse down for some impropriety . and at another he would get homesick and cry , however , he had one ultimate credit to his account which some of [location] had not . he stuck to the war , and was killed in battle at last .
corona 's architectural library was small , she found on the top shelf one book on the construction of chicken roosts . a pamphlet in explanation of the kindergarten system . a cook book that had belonged to her grandmother , and a treatise on crochet . there her domestic literature came to an end , she accordingly bought a book entitled north america homes ', . then , having , in addition , begged or borrowed everything within two covers relating to architecture that was to be found in her immediate circle of acquaintance .
we are moving about over the country , person whitcomb riley and i . in the capacity of a moral and spectacular show , i attend to the spectacular part of the business . that is more in my line , i am writing this at an imitation hotel where the roads fork . i will call it the fifth avenue hotel because the hotel at a railroad junction is generally called the fifth avenue . or the gem city house , or the palace hotel .
for works of travel , 10 cents per mile . and for political or other essays , two cents per page . or ten dollar per idea , and for theological and controversial work . seven dollar and fifty cents per cubic yard extracted . our clients are assured of prompt and immediate attention .
the doctor , as he rode home . was , on the whole , better pleased with his visit than he had expected to be . he had been told that his letter was argumentative and true , and that in itself had been much . at the end of the week he received a reply from the bishop . and found that it was not , at any rate , written by the chaplain .
she shuddered the more as she now remembered that this very day . in that very house , she had invited for her very self a similar fate . what if the duke had taken her word ? strange ! she would not have flinched then . she had felt no horror at the notion of such a death . and thus she now saw noaks conduct in a new light .
down the curve of the road a phaeton was coming . the pony tearing along at full gallop , within was the very lady whom i had come to meet . she lashed at the pony like one who endeavours to escape from some pressing danger . glancing ever backward over her shoulder , the bend of the road concealed from me what it was that had alarmed her . and i ran forward not knowing what to expect , the next instant i saw the pursuer .
gardner , dazed and weak , began selling , and finally liquidated the full line at prices ranging from 114 to 112 1/2 . but montgomery [male] had cleared dollar 58,550 , and all because it was he and not the market that got excited . it was not that he had realized heavily in his investments which caused his friends and his enemies to regard him in a new light . his profit had been quite small , as things go on the exchange in these days . the mere fact that he had shown such foresight proved sufficient cause for the reversal of opinion .
i have the lighter philosophies at my tongue 's tip . i can be merry , wise , [male] , grim , and sardonic . one by one , or all at once ; i have a pretty turn for anecdote . i know all the jests -- ancient and modern . past , present , and to come ; i can riddle you from dawn of day to set of sun .
it was generally felt that the way to find favour in the eyes of [female] . which were a charming blue , and well worth finding favour in -- was to show an intelligent and affectionate interest in her dog . this was so up to a certain point ; but no farther , for the mournful recollection of mr. [male] prevented her from meeting their advances in quite the spirit they could have wished . however , they persevered , and scarcely a week went by in which [female] was not rescued from an artfully arranged horrible fate by somebody . but all their energy was in reality wasted , for [female] remembered her faithful [male] .
we looked at the eminent novelist with admiration . we realized that like so many of our writers , actors , and even our thinkers . of today , he was an open-air man in every sense of the word . bulls , we explained , were not a department of research for which we were equipped . what we wanted , we said , was to learn something of his methods of work .
the truth is , i could not help regarding mrs. [female] as a decidedly plain looking woman . if not positively ugly , she was not , i think , very far from it . she was dressed , however , in exquisite taste -- and then i had no doubt that she had captivated my friend 's heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect and soul . she said very few words , and passed at once into her state room with mr. [male] . my old inquisitiveness now returned , there was no servant -- that was a settled point .
the old grecian theatre in the city road was the nursery of many members of the theatrical profession . and authors too , two well-known members of the savage club . [female] and pettitt , were writers of the common stuff necessary for the melodramas of the kind connected with their names . [male] would have made an equal fortune if exhibited as the original fat boy in [male] , or as a prize baby at a show .
there is always a curiously dream like atmosphere about a play founded on a book . one seems to have seen it all before , during the whole of the first act owen attributed to this his feeling of familiarity with what was going on on the stage . at the beginning of the second act he found himself anticipating events . but it was not till the third act that the truth sank in . the third was the only act in which , in his dramatization , he had taken any real liberties with the text of the novel .
i knew that they were hungarians the night i saw them . because i distinctly heard one of them say , `` what t'ell do we play next boys ? '' the reference to [female] tell was obvious . after every four tunes the orchestra are given a tall stein of beer . and they all stand up and drink it , shouting `` hoch ! ''
in the beginning , mohammedanism had no money . and it has never had anything to offer its client but heaven . nothing here below that was valuable , in addition to heaven hereafter . christian science has present health and a cheerful spirit to offer . for cash -- and in comparison with this bribe all other this world bribes are poor and cheap .
he seemed to be at a loss what to say next , and , leaning over . pretended to whisper to grant , then , as if he had been prompted by the great soldier . he straightened up and poured out a fervid eulogy on grant 's victories . adding , in an aside , as he finished , `` i nearly forgot that part of my speech , '' to the roaring delight of his hearers , while grant himself grimly smiled .
in the other paper he would find a lord [male] . a mr. [male] , a mr. [male] . a churchill , a chamberlain , a trevelyan , an acland . if this is not being governed by families i can not imagine what it is . i suppose it is being governed by extraordinary democratic coincidences .
the new batsman had the bowling , he snicked his first ball for a single . bringing the novelist to the fore again , and [male] wilberforce gosling vowed a vow that he would dismiss that distinguished novelist . but the best intentions go for nothing when one 's arm is feeling like lead . of all the miserable balls sent down that afternoon that one of gosling 's was the worst . it was worse than anything of [location] 's .
and after dinner he went to his shelves and took down lane 's three volume edition of `` the arabian nights , '' which he set himself to study with a new interest . it was long since he had looked into these wondrous tales . old beyond all human calculation , and fresher , even now , than the most modern of successful romances . after all , he was tempted to think , they might possess quite as much historical value as many works with graver pretentions to accuracy .
i wish to place before the reader some of the usual descriptions of the taj . and ask him to take note of the impressions left in his mind . these descriptions do really state the truth . as nearly as the limitations of language will allow , but language is a treacherous thing . a most unsure vehicle , and it can seldom arrange descriptive words in such a way that they will not inflate the facts .
then came a moment of excited movement , which would have been confusion but for the quick wit of ruth glidden . and the coolness and energy of the detective . while the entrapped villain was struggling like a fiend in the grasp of four strong men . ruth knelt beside the fallen woman and lifted her head . the next moment two or three officers came hastening in , and ferrars and brierly .
naturally , since an attack was about to be made upon the convent , these sisters had been expecting to be directed to some place of safety . probably they were under vow not to quit the walls . and they had been told to remain in this cell until they received further orders . in any case i adapted my conduct to this supposition . since it was clear that i must get them out of the room .
she said he had been home this summer on bizness down south and had come to see her . which billy said wuz true , a very handsome and elegant young gentleman having called twice to see his old nurse during the spring and summer . `` you know she lacks , '' that wuz aunt tryphena 's greatest condemnation to say folks lacked . she never told what they lacked , but left it to the imagination of the hearer . from her expression you would imagine they lacked all the cardinal virtues and them that wuz not cardinal .
the chief part in the game is taken by two players who station themselves one at each end of the car . and who adopt some distinctive costumes to indicate that they are `` it . '' the other players occupy the body of the car . or take up their position at intervals along the track . the object of each player should be to enter the car as stealthily as possible in such a way as to escape the notice of the players in distinctive dress .
back i went to the museum , fiercely plotting an ascent up the water spout or a burglarious entrance through a back window . when , to my delight , i saw an attendant gesticulating to me from a window three or four stories from the ground . my time was running very short , so i rapidly explained to him the predicament i was in . and implored him to throw my bag out of the window . he told me that he was a prisoner locked in to look after the building .
[female] went back to the chamber , tiburcio remained leaning against the table . his eyes fixed upon the candle which flickered in the breeze . slowly the light of the moon came in , white , climbing upon the walls . he arose with a sigh , went to the door . sat down upon the threshold , lighted his pipe and looked leisurely out upon the country .
[female] and [female] lived alone in a large house . i believe they did a good deal of entertaining at times . but on this occasion i was the only guest . the only other person of note in the place was ponsonby , the butler . it was not as if he minded talking about [male] .
and then he told them how , resolved to probe this pecksniff . and to prove the constancy and truth of [male] . he had conceived and entered on his plan ; and how , beneath her gentleness and patience . he had softened more and more ; still more and more beneath the goodness and simplicity . the honour and the manly faith of [male] .
every sham , as has often been said , proves some reality , petroleum exists . no doubt , and is an important addition to our national wealth . but the petroleum humbug or mania or superstition . or whatever you choose to call it , is a humbug . just as truly , and a big one , whether we use the word in its milder or its bitterer sense .
tessie gazed after him admiringly , he let himself into the dark store . so lately the scene of his torment , and on the way to his little room stopped to reach under the grocery counter for those hidden savings . to night he would add to them the fifteen dollar lavished upon him by gashwiler at the close of a week 's toil . the money was in a tobacco pouch . he lighted the lamp on his table .
one evenin we met a bridal procession . the groom was ridin in a peacock shaped gilt chariot drawed by four horses . accompanied by a band of music ; a big crowd of friends follered him . and coolies bearing torches ; it seemed as if he wanted to show himself off all he could . when they got to the house of the bride .
there is nothing more beneficent than accident insurance . i have seen an entire family lifted out of poverty and into affluence by the simple [male] of a broken leg . i have had people come to me on crutches . with tears in their eyes , to bless this beneficent institution . in all my experience of life , i have seen nothing so seraphic as the look that comes into a freshly mutilated man 's face when he feels in his vest pocket with his remaining hand and finds his accident ticket all right .
it was only lately , since he had joined the firm . that he had been conscious of any great strain , college had given him a glimpse of a larger life . and the office cramped him , he felt vaguely that there were bigger things in the world which he might be doing . his best friends , of whom he now saw little , were all men of adventure and enterprise . who had tried their hand at many things ; men like [male] .
at any rate , the old-fashioned spinster did not stay out of her home all night and get herself compromised . talked about , sent abroad , or , if she did , she knew enough to remain abroad until the gossip blew over . you think we can not see through all this ? science -- fiddlesticks ! the good-looking young scientist -- that 's why you could not stay abroad , we see it . [female] sees it .
miss mackenzie at once made up her mind that her money was gone ! but , in truth , this did not much annoy her , she had declared to herself once before that if anything was wrong about the money she would regard it as a present made to her brother . and when so thinking of it , she had . undoubtedly , felt that it was , not improbably , lost to her , it was something over a hundred a year to be deducted from her computed income . but she would still be able to live at the paragon quite as well as she had intended .
it is well that the rule does not hold off the stage . or good men might be misjudged , we ourselves . for instance , wear a clean collar -- sometimes , it might be very awkward for our family . especially on sundays , he has no power of repartee . has the stage villain , all the good people in the play say rude and insulting things to him .
swept from his saddle by a low branch . count [male] lay stunned upon the ground . the hunting party swept on , the riderless steed galloping wildly among them . no man turned back ; not one loved the count better than his sport . then did the woodman embrace him with tears .
then came in mr [male] , and [male] colza at once turned her attention to him . but mr [male] shook [male] colza off almost unceremoniously . and seated himself by [male] mackenzie . immediately afterwards arrived the doctor and his wife . the doctor was a very silent man , and as [male] himself was not given to much talking .
as they did not heed him , he predicted the plague . and left for smyrna , sure enough , the pestilence broke out just after his departure . and the ephesians telegraphed to smyrna , by the only means in their power , for his immediate return . gold , in the meanwhile , falling at least ten per cent . [male] reappeared in the twinkling of an eye .
martin could hardly be a mortal man , and not express in his face something of the anger and disdain with which mr pecksniff inspired him . but beyond this he evinced no knowledge whatever of that gentleman 's presence or existence . true , he had once , and that at first , glanced at him involuntarily . and with supreme contempt ; but for any other heed he took of him . there might have been nothing in his place save empty air .
for a moment there was a pause and a silence of utter astonishment . while the minds of those who had witnessed the affair adjusted themselves to the marvel . and then the world became full of starting eyes , yelling throats . and clutching hands , from all over the casino fresh units swarmed like bees to swell the crowd at the centre of things . promenaders ceased to promenade , waiters to wait , elderly gentlemen sprang on to tables .
now in history there is no revolution that is not a restoration . among the many things that leave me doubtful about the modern habit of fixing eyes on the future . none is stronger than this : that all the men in history who have really done anything with the future have had their eyes fixed upon the past . i need not mention the [organization] , the very word proves my case . the originality of [female] and [female] began with the digging up of old vases and manuscripts .
his position in the house depends firstly upon his athletic ability . and secondly upon the calibre of the prefects , given a timid set of prefects . and an unquestioned reputation in the football world . master bullock has an extremely pleasant time of it . he possesses no fags , but that does not worry him .
reviewing the matter later , i could see that i made one or two blunders in my conduct of the campaign to win over professor [female] . in the first place , i made a bad choice of time and place . at the moment this did not strike me , it is a simple matter . i reflected , for a man to pass another by haughtily and without recognition , when they meet on dry land . but , when the said man , being it should be remembered , an indifferent swimmer .
`` a psalm of life , '' by [female] . is like a treasure laid up in heaven , it should be learned for its future value to the child . not necessarily because the child likes it , its value will dawn on him . tell me not , in mournful numbers , life is but an empty dream ! for the soul is dead that slumbers , and things are not what they seem .
and less peaceful than the graves of the departed , these tombs themselves are full of the hopeless cries of the entombed . praying for help , praying for some strong hand to reach down and lift them out of their reeking . polluted , living death , the whole of our fair land is covered with jest such graves . its turf is tread down by the footprints of the mourners who go about the streets . they pray , they weep : the night is long , is long .
he was admirably equipped for success in finance . having the steely eye and square jaw without which it is hopeless for a man to enter that line of business . he possessed also an overwhelming confidence in himself . and the ability to switch a cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other without wiggling his ears . which , as you know , is the stamp of the true monarch of the money market .
i turned to the weather man . he was wiping the palms of his hands on his hips and looking foolishly happy . i said nothing , there was nothing that could be said . before we left the office he stopped to write out the prophecy for wednesday . june 21 , the first day of summer .
on a side table the stranger sees a number of what appear to him diagrams of city improvements . with mains and drains and all sorts of things . but on closer inspection they turn out to be the plans of the table . you discover one bearing your name , and opposite it a red cross . or perhaps i ought to say an exaggerated asterisk , when you have taken your seat downstairs in the banqueting [male] you inspect your plan .
i do not say that such a story could ever be common , but it is more probable than the world might credit . sometimes the man is better without the woman , the woman without the man . an old anglicized frenchman , i used to meet often in my earlier journalistic days . held a theory , concerning man 's future state . that has since come to afford me more food for reflection than .
in that vein of delightful facetiousness which so endears him to all followers and perpetrators of the drama . the `` one in authority '' rent and tore [male] play . he knocked [male] play down . and kicked it ; he jumped on it with large feet . he poured cold water on it .
mer , compelled upon olympus here to stop , while the other gods go down to play the hero . do not be surprised if on this mountain top you find your mercury is down at zero , ap . to earth away to join in mortal acts , and gather fresh materials to write on . investigate more closely , several facts , that i for centuries have thrown some light on , dia . i , as the modest moon with crescent bow .
[male] , [male] , an [location] westerner who murdered . stole , and appeared in paper novels for the benefit of the messenger boy . the author , and the publisher , [male] , king . a scotchman who was considered good enough to be elected king of england . jekyll , doctor , a physician who took a dose of his own medicine .
not very long after this , a young stranger made his appearance in fashionable circles . and created quite a flutter among the ladies , he had . besides larger whiskers , larger moustache , and larger imperial than glover , a superb goatee . and a decided foreign accent , he soon threw the [location] in the shade . especially as a whisper got out that he was a french count travelling through the country .
but even if there had been only one other , it would have complicated matters . if you go to a boy and say , `` either you or [male] were out of your house last night at twelve o'clock , '' the boy does not reply , sir , i can not tell a lie . i was out of my house last night at twelve o'clock . he simply assumes the animated expression of a stuffed fish .
another frost of this sort , and the sprouting keenness of the house would be nipped in the bud . he conducted himself with much tact . another [male] might have made the fatal error of trying to stir his team up with pungent abuse . he realised what a mistake this would be , it did not need a great deal of discouragement to send the house back to its old slack ways . another such defeat , following immediately in the footsteps of the first , and they would begin to ask themselves what was the good of mortifying the flesh simply to get a licking from a scratch team by twenty-four points .
and then there was the haughty lady who sold programmes in the haymarket amphitheatre . but she 's got the sack , so cookson informs me . therefore , as i shall tell [female] plainly that i disapprove of the cabin . the past can hatch no egg of discord in the shape of the cast off glove . the only thing that i can think of as needing suppression is the part i played in mr. [male] 's system .
some weeping over their disaster , some laughing at the strange figure the others made in their robber 's costume . one dolorously reciting the list of the things he had lost . another declaring that the loss of a box of agnus dei he was bringing home from rome afflicted him more than all besides . in short , the whole wood resounded with the moans and lamentations of the despoiled wretches . the brother and sister beheld them with deep compassion .
the [female] , with his gentle nature , his polish , his sweetness . his moral and verbal purity , seemed pathetically out of place in his rude and autocratic vocation . it seemed another instance of the irony of fate . he was going home under a cloud . the passengers knew about his trouble , and were sorry for him .
as a rule , i try not to look into mirrors any more than is absolutely necessary . things are depressing enough as they are without my going out of my way to make myself miserable . but every once in a while it is unavoidable , there are certain mirrors in town with which i am brought face to face on occasion and there is nothing to do but make the best of it . i have come to classify them according to the harshness with which they fling the truth into my face . i am unquestionably at my worst in the mirror before which i try on hats .
no sign of life was at present evident in those bibulous abodes . no qui his had indicated breakfast , and she put her utmost irony into the reflection that [organization] slept late after their protracted industry last night over diaries and roman roads . by a natural revulsion , violent in proportion to the depth of her previous regard for major benjy . she hugged herself more closely on the prospect of exposing him than on that of exposing the other . she had had daydreams about major benjy and the conversion of these into nightmares annealed her softness into the semblance of some red hot stone .
mr. [male] sat in his luxurious suite at the cosmopolis . smoking one of his admirable cigars and chatting with his old friend , professor binstead . a stranger who had only encountered mr. [male] in the lobby of the hotel would have been surprised at the appearance of his sitting room . for it had none of the rugged simplicity which was the keynote of its owner 's personal appearance . [male] was a man with a hobby .
this , of course , was wrong , it was no part of [male] 's duties as assistant master at [organization] to wander about bestowing brotherly kisses on housemaids . on the other hand , there was no great harm done , in the circles in which violet moved the kiss was equivalent to the hand shake of loftier society . everybody who came to the back door kissed violet . the carrier did ; so did the grocer , the baker . the butcher , the gardener , the postman .
it was almost bed time before he came down the stairs again . yet , i think her name is meredith , and i think she 's gone to vermont . and she has the most wonderful head of mahogany colored hair that i ever saw in my life , were the only definite clues that he had been able to contribute to the cause . in the slow , lagging week that followed , stanton did not find himself at all pleased with the particular steps which he had apparently been obliged to take in order to ferret out [female] 's real name and her real city address .
approaching adelaide we dismounted from the train , as the french say , and were driven in an open carriage over the hills and along their slopes to the city . it was an excursion of an hour or two . and the charm of it could not be overstated , i think , the road wound around gaps and gorges . and offered all varieties of scenery and prospect . mountains , crags , country homes .
[female] threw down the stump of his cigar . and grunted irritably , inside charing cross station business was proceeding as usual , porters wheeling baggage trucks moved to and fro like juggernauts . belated trains clanked in , glad to get home . while others , less fortunate , crept reluctantly out through the blackness and disappeared into an inferno of detonating fog signals . for outside the fog still held , the air was cold and raw and tasted coppery .
d'artagnan took advantage of this to go and ask grimaud how he was . monk requested athos to conduct him to the chamber he lived in . this chamber was still full of smoke and rubbish . more than fifty balls had passed through the windows and mutilated the walls . they found a table , inkstand , and materials for writing .
in the mean while you may be kissing and slabbering of your mistris in the next room . or contriving what 's to be done about the marriage , and keeping of the wedding . but perhaps , through the discord of the friends , it will not be long before you are disturb would . the differences oft rising so high , that the sound thereof . clatters through the walls , into the ears of the lovers .
but the southwest wind of spring brings also remorse . we catch the vague spirit of unrest in the air and we regret our misspent youth . ashe was doing this , even as he skipped , he was conscious of a wish that he had studied harder at college and was now in a position to be doing something better than hack work for a soulless publishing company . never before had he been so completely certain that he was sick to death of the rut into which he had fallen . the larsen exercises , invented by a certain lieutenant larsen , of [organization] .
the point is that man does what he likes . he claims the right to take his mother nature under his control . he claims the right to make his child the superman . in his image , once flinch from this creative authority of man . and the whole courageous raid which we call civilization wavers and falls to pieces .
roland stiffened in his chair , now that the ghastly moment had come . he felt too petrified with fear even to act the little part in which he had been diligently rehearsed by the obliging mr. [male] . he simply sat and did nothing , it was speedily made clear to him that miss chilvers would do all the actual doing that was necessary . the butler had drawn no false picture of her personal appearance . dyed yellow hair done all frizzy was but one fact of her many sided impossibilities .
three or more respond -- but there must not be less than three ; the president lays their names before the other presidents . with the request that they furnish antagonists for these challengers from among their corps . this is promptly done , it chanced that the present occasion was the battle day of the red cap corps . they were the challengers , and certain caps of other colors had volunteered to meet them . the students fight duels in the room which i have described .
in the [female] the members of my class were collected . some were changing their clothes ; others , already changed , were tapping the punch ball . they knew that i always came punctually at nine o'clock . and they liked to be ready for me , amongst those present was sidney price . [male] brought up short , hiccuping , in the midst of them .
a striking feature of the now taking place art exhibition at [organization] in the thiergarten is offered by the absolutely marvellous paintings exhibited by the princess [female] paul cecilie hohenzollern stickitintothem . a cousin of our noble governor , the paintings which the princess has been preciously pleased to paint and has even stooped to exhibit to the filled with wonder eye of the public have been immediately awarded the first prize in each class . while it would be invidious even to suggest that any one of her high incipiency 's pictures is better than any other . our feeling is that especially the picture night on [location] is of so rare a quality both of technique and of inspiration that it supersedes the bounds of the hitherto thought to be possible art in [location] . the princess 's conception of night .
here he started to turn the vehicle round a little -- and kept on doing so until the britchka capsized on to its side . and chichikov landed in the mud on his hands and knees . fortunately selifan succeeded in stopping the horses , although they would have stopped of themselves . seeing that they were utterly worn out , this unforeseen catastrophe evidently astonished their driver . slipping from the box , he stood resting his hands against the side of the britchka .
in old times the fijians were fierce fighters . they were very religious , and worshiped idols ; the big chiefs were proud and haughty . and they were men of great style in many ways . all chiefs had several wives , the biggest chiefs sometimes had as many as fifty . when a chief was dead and ready for burial , four or five of his wives were strangled and put into the grave with him .
when he died , by slow degrees , folks said . he 's gone higher ; but it 's my opinion he 's settin by the fire , he never tried to make a speech . a speech was far beyond his reach , he did not even dare to try . he did his work upon the sly , he took the voter to the rear and gently whispered in his ear .
but finally i did get my last iron off , and was a free man once more . i took a good breath of relief , and reached for the king 's irons , too late ! in comes the master , with a light in one hand and his heavy walking staff in the other . i snuggled close among the wallow of snorers . to conceal as nearly as possible that i was naked of irons ; and i kept a sharp lookout and prepared to spring for my man the moment he should bend over me .
i have pondered much upon the apparition , and have come to a definite opinion . a man i met later at frankfort . and to whom i described the pair , said he had seen them himself in [location] . three weeks after the termination of the fashoda incident . while a traveller for some english steel works whom we met in strassburg remembered having seen them in [location] during the excitement caused by the transvaal question .
it is not on account of his education that i love him . no , it is not that , he is self educated , and does really know a multitude of things . but they are not so , it is not on account of his chivalry that i love him . no , it is not that , he told on me . but i do not blame him ; it is a peculiarity of sex .
the cart jerked forward , and young [male] and his colleague grinned their valedictions . in their hearts the knowledge that they had just lived a crowded hour of glorious life . the cart jolted its uneasy way along the dusty high road . with bindle beside the driver , mrs. [female] on the blankets as grim as destiny itself . engaged in working up a case against bindle , and the boy scout watchful and silent .
`` hang to it , boys , '' called the crowd from the steamer 's deck . and hang they did , they were almost exhausted when they got them . men leaning from the steamer threw them ropes and one by one every man was hauled aboard just as the lifeboat sank under their feet , saved ! by heaven , saved , by one of the smartest pieces of rescue work ever seen on the lake . there 's no use describing it ; you need to see rescue work of this kind by lifeboats to understand it .
he might , perhaps , be up in the eiffel tower and the taxi man get a stroke of paralysis . and then he would starve to death trying to find his way back . after all , the guide has to have the kind of pluck and hardihood that ought to be well rewarded . why , in other countries , like switzerland , they have to use dogs for it . and in [male] , when these plucky fellows throw themselves into it .
`` do come , papa , '' said [female] , jumping up and putting her arm round her father 's shoulders . she was more than willing to meet them all half-way . she would sit in the arm chair all the morning and try to drink porter at lunch if they would receive her father graciously . of course she was bound to her husband . she did not wish not to be bound to him , she was quite sure that she loved her husband with a perfect love .
[male] is a better title , because it does give a suggestion of the nature of the book . no novel with a tragic ending , no powerful realistic novel , would be called [female] . without having read [female] i should say that it was a charming story of suburban life . told mostly in dialogue , and that [female] herself was a perfect dear . though a little cruel about that first box of chocolates he sent her .
at this announcement the rogerses , who were all sturdy trenchermen . set up such a howl as to bring mrs. rogers and the other maid out of the omnibus . just at that moment [female] , a precocious youth of twelve . rode up full of importance and information , he pushed his way through the mass of rogerses . and without preliminary shouted , `` 33 lebanon avenue , [location] ; that 's where the van went . ''
patty hesitated an instant , well , she admitted , i suppose the butler might tell her . i will put on a hat -- this with the air of one who is making a really great concession . some more banging of bureau drawers . and she appeared in a black velvet hat trimmed with lace . with the brown jacket of her suit over her red blouse .
in front of the cottage stood six children . a nurse , and the fellow from the grocer 's staring . from the windows of the houses opposite projected about four hundred heads of both sexes , staring . down the road came galloping five more children , a dog . three men , and a boy , about to stare , and on our porch .
at the name , which was the only one by which she knew ferrars . mrs. [female] flushed and paled , and the smile with which she received this news was slightly tremulous . and then she told them how she was stopping . for a short time , with a friend in bloomsbury . her husband 's business affairs .
psmith 's share in the entertainment was more obvious . the early comers had seen his interview with [male] . and were relating it with gusto to their friends . their attitude towards psmith was that of a group of men watching a terrier at a rat hole . they looked to him to provide entertainment for them .
we all know the man whom children or dogs love instinctively . it is a rare gift to be able to inspire this affection . the fates have been kind to him . but to inspire the affection of inanimate things is something greater . the man to whom a collar or a window sash takes instinctively is a man who may truly be said to have luck on his side .
when she had gone , however , i sat up till late . thinking calmly over my position , and the complications which might be expected to ensue from it . it would be very easy to harrow the reader 's feelings and work upon his sympathies here by a telling description of my terror and my guilty confusion at the unforeseen consequences of what i had done . but i think , in relating an experience of this kind , the straightforward way is always the best . and i do not care to heighten the effect by attributing to myself a variety of sensations which i do not remember to have actually felt at the time .
had mixed cement in the drawing room ; had caused the anvil to ring out till midnight . aroused no admiration in higgins 's mind . in addition to this , the ancient nobleman had been penuriously strict in his examination of accounts . exacting the uttermost farthing , so the humble servitor regarded his memory with supreme contempt . i realised before the drive was finished from the station to chizelrigg chase that there was little use of introducing me to higgins as a foreigner and a fellow servant .
he saw the odd look in her eyes and the drawn . uncertain smile on her lips , but he attributed them to wonder and incredulity . somehow , after all these years , he was transformed before her very eyes . she was looking upon a new personality , he was no longer montgomery . the brother , but she could not explain how and when the change crept over her .
he peremptorily orders them out . they do not answer him , they do not argue . in dead silence , and with one accord they fall upon him . all you can see from the bed is a confused tangle of waving arms and legs . suggestive of an intoxicated octopus trying to find bottom .
youth is gay and hopeful , age is covered with experience and scars where the skin has been knocked off and had to grow on again . to the young a dollar looks large and strong , but to the middle-aged and the old it is weak and inefficient . when we are in the heyday and fizz of existence . we believe everything ; but after awhile we murmur . what 's that you are givin us , or words of like character .
two others came in together , but i was compelled to content myself with memorising their features . for i did not learn their names , these men were evidently collectors . for i heard the rattle of money in every case . yet here was a small shop , doing apparently very little business , for i had been within it for more than half an hour . and yet remained the only customer , if credit were given , one collector would certainly have been sufficient .
fenn looked annoyed , he had miscounted the balls . and now his partner , who had no pretensions to be considered a bat . would have to face [male] , impossible as he had found it to defeat fenn . [male] had never lost his head or his length . he was bowling fully as well as he had done at the beginning of the innings .
so i made up my mind that i would outwit this man at his own game . i let him talk straight ahead and encouraged him all i could . until he finally left me with a sheet of questions which i was to answer as an applicant . now this was what i was waiting for ; i had decided that , if that company wanted information about me . they should have it , and have the very best quality i could supply .
they were interested , profoundly interested , but it was not the kind of interest we were looking for . to get an idea of their attitude you have to hold in mind their extremely high sense of solidarity . they were not each choosing a lover ; they had not the faintest idea of love . sex love , that is , these girls -- to each of whom motherhood was a lodestar . and that motherhood exalted above a mere personal function , looked forward to as the highest social service .
the saint looked neither at the view nor at the pot . and at her widowed mother still less , for lo ! she had a vision : the head and shoulders ofaugustine were sliding like some miraculous enamel along the rough cast wall . it is a gentle saint who is content with half another saint to see her die . in her death , as in her life , [female] deodata did not accomplish much .
we traversed miles of these schluter masterpieces . eventually we heard sounds of martial music without . and we went to a window overlooking a paved courtyard . and from that point we presently beheld a fine sight . for the moment the courtyard was empty , except that in the center stood a great mass of bronze .
when [female] fell the spectators present could not refrain from giving expression to their excited feelings . they actually shouted ; and a young collegian who was present , and who became a protestant clergyman . was so carried away by the general feeling , as to fling up his hat in the air . and shout , `` hurra for o'connell ! '' the excitement in [location] , when the result was known .
now i have often come across ants nests in my travels . but never when swimming , in seas and rivers , pools and lakes . i have wandered , but nature has never put ants eggs in my way , no doubt . it would be only right -the goldfish has a keener eye than i have for these things .
she looked at him and tried to make her expression contemptuous . but he only laughed , acknowledging her defeat but disclaiming all future interest in the punch . she left the room , at seven thirty , her cheeks glowing and her high piled hair gleaming with a suspicion of brilliantine . evylyn descended the stairs , mrs. [female] . a little woman concealing a slight nervousness under red hair and an extreme empire gown .
for years it was patronized by his countrymen until they were ruined . later only royalty and tourists were permitted to enter and form a mistaken idea of the real french cafe . pay double prices for everything . see a few chorus girls , hear champagne bottles . and talk to english speaking waiters , ambition : americans . recreation .
with those words , the good man patted mrs lupin 's hand between his own . as if he would have added `` think of this , my good woman ! '' and walked away in a sort of ecstasy or rapture . with his hat under his arm , jonas sat in the attitude in which mr pecksniff had left him . gazing moodily at his friend ; who , surrounded by a heap of documents .
[female] was an extraordinarily beautiful girl , a daughter of the gods . divinely tall , and most divinely fair , from her mother she had inherited the dark eyes and [female] complexion which went so well with her mass of dark hair . from her father a chin of peculiar determination and perfect teeth . her body was strong and supple , she radiated health . to her friends ruth was a source of perplexity .
it may readily be seen that a woman with the square . heavy jawed face pictured by no , 5 , should not adopt a straight , or nearly straight . bang , nor wear her hair low on her forehead . nor adjust the greater portion of her hair so that the coil can not be seen above the crown of her head . the low bang brings into striking relief all the hard lines of her face and gives the impression that she has pugilistic tendencies .
there was not the least curiosity or impertinence in the manner of this offer . which was open hearted , unaffected , and good natured , as it was next to impossible that he should not have his confidence awakened by a deportment so prepossessing and kind . [male] plainly stated what had brought him into those parts . and even made the very difficult avowal that he was poor , he did not say how poor . it must be admitted , rather throwing off the declaration with an air which might have implied that he had money enough for six months .
columbia was the only personage unmoved by all the fiery demonstrations . she stood rigid , looking strangely massive and tall , till the last rocket had spent itself . then her progress began again with a sort of jerk . a shudder went over her frame , the pole wavered in her hands . those hands that seemed so limp and lifeless -- she tottered .
`` have at you , '' cried the saxon , thus luckily the whole story was cut off on the first page and ended . then the lure of the city lured him . his fate took him to [location] . to [location] , and to [location] , during all this time women were calling to him . he knew and came to be friends with -- [male] , [male] .
everyone knows that the people who can least pay their debts are the people who are always trying to . among the poor a payment may be as rash as a speculation . among the rich a bankruptcy may be as safe as a bank , considering the class from which private soldiers are taken . there is an atrocious meanness in the idea of buying their blood abroad . while we sell their sticks at home .
the eagles descended gradually as they drew near the shore . intending , as i supposed , to alight on one of the welsh mountains ; but when they came to the distance of about sixty yards two guns were fired at them . loaded with balls , one of which took place in a bladder of liquor that hung to my waist . the other entered the breast of the foremost eagle . who fell to the ground , while that which i rode , having received no injury .
how curious it is that we always consider solemnity and the absence of all gay surprises and encounter of wits as essential to the idea of the future life of those whom we thus deprive of half their faculties and then called blessed ! there are not a few who , even in this life , seem to be preparing themselves for that smileless eternity to which they look forward . by banishing all gaiety from their hearts and all joyousness from their countenances . i meet one such in the street not unfrequently , a person of intelligence and education . but who gives me such a rayless and chilling look of recognition .
one of the characters in `` a prince there was '' is the editor of a magazine and . curiously enough , he has been made the hero of the film . of course , there may be something to be said for editors . indeed , we have heard them trying to say it . and yet they remain among the forces of darkness and of mystery .
i happened to call at his house on the second evening of the explorer 's visit . and already the mischief had been done , [male] was one of those lean , hard bitten men with smouldering eyes and a brick red complexion . he looked what he was , the man of action and enterprise . he had the wiry frame and strong jaw without which no explorer is complete . and mortimer , beside him , seemed but a poor , soft product of our hot house civilization .
`` i hate it , [female] ! '' there was such feeling and decision in [female] 's voice that [female] turned and regarded her curiously . `` i want to be happy , oh , i do so want to be happy , [female] . '' there was almost a sob in [female] 's voice and her eyes were moist with unshed tears . [male] said nothing , but he pondered deeply as they walked slowly along .
`` poor mr , [male] , '' said [male] . slowly , but with a simplicity which made it evident to [female] that the young minister had not repeated to miss [female] the talk that had lately occurred between them . ah , now , do not say poor mr , [male] , i do not pity mr . [male] at all , but i pity your father a little . and i do not want to displease him , therefore , you see .
and then some big brained person suggested the club idea . which stands alone as an example of [location] dry humour . there are now no boxing contests in [location] , [male] and his fellows would be shocked at the idea of such a thing . all that happens now is exhibition sparring bouts between members of the club . it is true that next day the papers very tactlessly report the friendly exhibition spar as if it had been quite a serious affair .
the rest of the letter was on other subjects . it took fenn less than a minute to decide to patronise that opening performance . he was never in the habit of paying very much attention to risks when he wished to do anything . and now he felt as if he cared even less than usual what might be the outcome of the adventure . since he had ceased to be on speaking terms with [male] .
fenn took the rebuke in silence . cast one glance at the sausage which confronted him . and then pushed it away with such unhesitating rapidity that mr [male] glared at him as if about to take up the cudgels for the rejected viand . perhaps he remembered that it scarcely befitted the dignity of a house master to enter upon a wrangle with a member of his house on the subject of the merits and demerits of sausages . for he refrained , and fenn was allowed to go on with his meal in peace .
in the morning room of his sister in law 's house groby lington fidgeted away the passing minutes with the demure restlessness of advanced middle age . about a quarter of an hour would have to elapse before it would be time to say his good byes and make his way across the village green to the station . with a selected escort of nephews and nieces . he was a good natured , kindly dispositioned man , and in theory he was delighted to pay periodical visits to the wife and children of his dead brother [male] . in practice , he infinitely preferred the comfort and seclusion of his own house and garden .
the shop girl had espied an acquaintance in the crowd . she gave tongue , `` mordee ! cummere , cummere quick , sumfin ', hap'nin ' ! '' [female] , accompanied by perhaps a dozen more of [location] 's millions . added herself to the audience , these all belonged to the class which will gather round and watch silently while a motorist mends a tyre . they are not impatient , they do not call for rapid and continuous action .
it was not until afternoon , when the sun had turned ruddy and shadows were beginning to stretch dark fingers across the land . that they finished the job , but at last the saplings were set in the notches . the nooses were formed and fastened on , grass and leaves were strewn over the snares . chips , hewn branches . and other evidences of their work were removed , they sat down and looked proudly at each other .
few imagine that a caricaturist requires models to draw from . although i will not further digress at this point . i may perhaps be pardoned if i return later on in this book to the explanation of my modus operandi . a subject which , if i may judge from the number of letters i receive about it . is likely to prove of interest to a large number of my readers .
one would imagine that these paraphernalia would not have been much admired by a modern fine lady . but mrs [female] was resolved to approve of all the captains connexions . she wished , indeed , the squaw had been better provided with linen . but she owned there was much taste and fancy in her ornaments . she made no doubt , therefore , that madam squinkinacoosta was a young lady of good sense and rare accomplishments .
a horrible nausea had seized me from the tossing which i had undergone . and i felt as i did upon the ocean when first i experienced those movements of which the english have taken so perfidious an advantage . i had to sit for a few moments with my head upon my hands beside the ruins of my barrel . but there was no time for rest , already i heard shouts above me which told that my pursuers were descending the hill . i dashed into the thickest part of the underwood , and i ran and ran until i was utterly exhausted .
i was quite willing to remain with him and watch his garden . a much less fatiguing business in my opinion than guarding a flock of sheep . and as there was no need to discuss the question of wages . the morisco soon had a servant and i a master , i remained with him more than a month . not that the life i led with him was much to my liking .
whereat the churl behind the desk gat him down from his stool and closed one eye in a wink . `` there is one room , '' he says , and places his forefinger along the side of his nose . in the manner of a man who places his forefinger along the side of his nose . but at this point i am stopped short by the warning passage through the room of a cold . damp current of air as from the grave , and i know that it is one of mr. [male] 's vice deputies flitting by on his rounds in defense of the public morals .
to continue with the german genders : a tree is male , its buds are female . its leaves are neuter ; horses are sexless , dogs are male . cats are female -- tomcats included , of course . a person 's mouth , neck , bosom . elbows , fingers , nails , feet , and body are of the male sex .
honestly , it is but a dog 's life . that of the short story writer , i particularly wished at this point to introduce a description of mr rackstraw 's country house and estate . featuring the private football ground with its fringe of noble trees . it would have served a double purpose , not only charming the lover of nature . but acting as a fine stimulus to the youth of the country .
this letter is accompanied by a tin type picture of a young man who shaves in such a way as to work in a streak of whiskers by which he fools himself into the notion that he has a long and luxuriant mustache . he looks like a person who , under the influence of liquor . would weep on the bosom of a total stranger and then knock his wife down because she split her foot open instead of splitting the kindling . he is not a bad looking man , and the freckles on his hands do not hurt him as a husband . any young lady who would like to save him from a drunkard 's grave can address him in my care .
the prophecy was fulfilled , on the following wednesday there was a match between the under sixteen and a scratch side . [male] 's name was among the under sixteen . and on the saturday he was playing for the third eleven in a trial game . `` this place is ripping , '' he said to himself . as he saw his name on the list .
he looked round him for shelter . he had reached the rose garden in the course of his perambulations . at the far end was a summerhouse , he turned up his coat collar and ran . as he drew near , he heard a slow and dirgelike whistling proceeding from the interior . plunging in out of breath , just as the deluge began .
these were vague and shimmering glories of vision rather than definite plans for his life work . yet he did with all his will determine to own and play upon some roaring instrument of brass . and , after all , this was no new desire of his ; it was only an old one inflamed to take a new form . nor was music the root of it . for the identical desire is often uproarious among them that hate music .
the heroine of maría is more a woman . less a child than [female] , hence the fate of the spanish girl is tragic where that of the other maiden is merely pitiful . [female] , on the other hand , is stouter in texture . in maría there is no love struggle . the struggle is with life and circumstance .
[female] washed the dishes deftly enough , as marilla who kept a sharp eye on the process , discerned . later on she made her bed less successfully . for she had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick . but is was done somehow and smoothed down ; and then marilla , to get rid of her . told her she might go out of doors and amuse herself until dinner time .
ghosts with no position to maintain -- mere middle class ghosts . occasionally , i believe , do a little haunting on off nights : on all hallows eve . and at midsummer ; and some will even run up for a mere local event . to celebrate , for instance , the anniversary of the hanging of somebody 's grandfather . or to prophesy a misfortune , he does love prophesying a misfortune .
the company thus assembled , are entertained with a variety of tunes . played upon a set of bells , fixed in a steeple hard by -- as these bells are well toned . and the musician , who has a salary from the city . for playing upon them with keys , is no bad performer . the entertainment is really agreeable , and very striking to the ears of a stranger .
the bella union was a pretty fair sample of the theatre in those days . it was a low wooden structure with a perpetual band on the outside . that played gay and festive circus tunes early and often . inside you could poison your soul at the bar and see the show at one and the same price of admission . in an adjoining room silent men joined the hosts of faro and the timid tenderfoot gamboled o'er the green .
the widger took the extended palm in her shrivelled fingers and made four rapid dabs in the middle of it with the forefinger of her other hand . as if she were scornfully pointing out defects in its workmanship . then she opened the drawer of the little stand with a spiteful jerk . and withdrew thence something which she put to her sinister optic . and began rapidly screwing it round with both hands .
jameson endured postponement three days , then resolved to wait no longer , without any orders . excepting mr. [male] 's significant silence -- he cut the telegraph wires on the 29th . and made his plunge that night , to go to the rescue of the women and children . by urgent request of a letter now nine days old . as per date , -- a couple of months old , in fact .
a vast multitude residential , and a vaster come per rail from town . three glorious days of excellent racing , at once national and unique , and before all and above all . a contest free from all chicanery , and the very embodiment of fairplay . the new lock at teddington must be a patent one . as there is no quay , flannels in moderation are pardonable .
king : oh , it 's not ungrammatical , i can not allow that . unpleas antly personal , perhaps , but written with an epigrammatical point that is very rare nowadays . very rare indeed , [male] : why do they represent you with such a big nose ? king : eh ? yes , it is a big one ! why , the fact is that , in the cartoons of a comic paper .
the safety pins which are in the bureau in the next room . place the child in the scales . the father should then sit on top of the child to hold him down . weigh father and child together , then deduct the father 's weight from the gross tonnage . and the weight of the child is the result .
mr waller looked with interest at [male] . who shuffled and felt awkward , he was hoping that psmith would say nothing about the reason of his engaging bill in combat . he had an uneasy feeling that mr waller 's gratitude would be effusive and overpowering . and he did not wish to pose as the brave young hero . there are moments when one does not feel equal to the role .
even a jury would have penetration enough to discover that , a writer 's ideas must be a good deal confused . a good deal out of line and sequence . when he starts out to say that a man met a counselor 's wife in the street . and then right in the midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching people and makes them stand still until he jots down an inventory of the woman 's dress . that is manifestly absurd , it reminds a person of those dentists who secure your instant and breathless interest in a tooth by taking a grip on it with the forceps .
[female] , aged thirty one , good , gentle , bashful , timid , lived in a quiet village in [location] . he was superintendent of the presbyterian sunday school . it was but a humble distinction ; still , it was his only official one . and he was modestly proud of it and was devoted to its work and its interests . the extreme kindliness of his nature was recognized by all ; in fact .
[male] was in something of a panic . he wanted the money immediately , and he was now inspired also with a vague idea of attending the gamma psi dance . he wanted to see edith -- edith whom he had not met since one romantic night at the [location] country club just before he went to [female] . the affair had died , drowned in the turmoil of the war and quite forgotten in the arabesque of these three months . but a picture of her , poignant , debonnaire .
i think nothing will ever erase from my mind the moment when the central idea of the girl who waited came to me . it was a boisterous october evening . the wind had been rising all day , now the branches of the lilac were dancing in the rush of the storm . and far out in the bay one could see the white crests of the waves gleaming through the growing darkness . we had just finished tea , the lamp was lit in our little drawing room .
towards night the horror of the situation increased in a measure far beyond that marked by the darkness . all day long the sea had been washing over the ship . but by taking refuge in the berths and on the tables and benches in the saloon it had been possible to keep comparatively dry . as night fell the tide rose , and at midnight the water came rushing over the deck in huge volumes . filling the saloon , and making the cabins floating coffins .
[female] was not one of your common , coarse , county fair barkers , he was a pretty high toned article . had nice , curly black hair and did not spare the bear 's grease . wore a silk hat and a prince [male] coat all the time . except when he was orating , and then he shed the coat to get freer action with his arms . and when he talked he used the whole language , you bet .
`` the best care we can , '' [male] said . it did not seem sufficient , he added : `` the best possible care , doctor , '' and tried to look dependable and trustworthy , like a boy scout , he was aware that the effort failed miserably . at his signal , the two plainclothes [organization] men took over from the attendants . they marched [male] out to their car .
but [male] , just because he knew that he was wet and fancied that he must look ridiculous . held his peace , and presently , his secret still locked in his bosom . and his collar sticking limply to his neck . he crept downstairs , avoiding the society of his fellow man . and slunk out into the night where , if there was no [male] , there were .
now daisy used to go up for solitary rambles on the fells sometimes , when she generally took [female] as a protector . he was becoming very nearly as active as ever , and now there was a stronger motive than before for pursuing the swallows . for he had a notion that they would be rather good eating . but one morning she missed him on her way back through the village by the lake . she was sure he was with her on the pier .
he looked very handsome , very gallant , his boyish face flashing challenge to the fates . i fancy veronica is going to be an authoress , her mother thinks this may account for many things about her that have been troubling us . the story never got far , it was laid aside for the more alluring work of play writing . and apparently forgotten , i came across the copy book containing her `` rough notes '' the other day , there is decided flavour about them .
at length they drew near new thermopylae . where , that same evening , mrs hominy would disembark . a gleam of comfort sunk into [organization] 's bosom when she told him this . mark needed none ; but he was not displeased . it was almost night when they came alongside the landing place .
in 1920 , and later included in the o. [male] memorial collection for the same year . i like it least of all the stories in this volume . my amusement was derived from the fact that the camel part of the story is literally true . in fact , i have a standing engagement with the gentleman involved to attend the next fancy dress party to which we are mutually invited . attired as the latter part of the camel -- this as a sort of atonement for being his historian .
at the extreme end , and he meant to have that coy vegetable if he had to squeeze the pot to get at it . to take another instance , all the afternoon of the previous day he had bowled patiently at fenn while the latter lifted every other ball into space . he had been taken off three times , and at every fresh attack he had plodded on doggedly . until at last , as he had expected , the batsman had misjudged a straight one . and he had bowled him all over his wicket .
i next tried my hand at the organ grinding for a while . and may say that i made out pretty well , it is a plain . straightforward business , and requires no particular abilities . you can get a music mill for a mere song . and to put it in order , you have but to open the works .
he did not hope to be able to reconcile her to his marriage at once . and perhaps he entertained some faint idea that for the first six months of his new married life the cedars would be quite as pleasant without his mother as with her . but a final reconciliation would be more easy if he and his wife had the mackenzies of incharrow to back them . than it could be without such influence , and as for the [location] gossip of the thing . the finale to the romance of the lion and the lamb .
`` that tastes good , if this keeps on , i will be in as good shape as i was last spring before you know it ! '' leaning far back in the rocking chair , his hands behind his head . he smoked with fervor ; but suddenly he jumped in a way which showed that his nerves were far from normal . his feet came to the floor with a thump . he jerked the cigar out of his mouth .
fables should not be composed to outrage the understanding ; but by making the wonderful appear possible . and creating in the mind a pleasing interest , they may both surprise and entertain . which can not be effected where no regard is paid to probability , i have never yet found a regular . well connected fable in any of our books of chivalry -- they are all inconsistent and monstrous . the style is generally bad ; and they abound with incredible exploits .
when the duke [female] choiseul . who was a remarkably meagre looking man , came to [location] to negotiate a peace . [male] , being asked whether the french government had sent the preliminaries of a treaty . answered , `` he did not know , but they had sent the outline of an ambassador . '' it is with narrow souled people as with narrow necked bottles .
but that was no matter , for the dog fight was always a bigger interest anyway . the men rose , sometimes , to observe it the better and bet on it . and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out over their balusters with the same object . and all broke into delighted ejaculations from time to time . in the end , the winning dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his paws .
presently he would come in and join [male] on the porch . the risk of interruption was negligible , nutty mixed himself a drink and settled down to brood bitterly . as he often did , on the doctor who had made that disastrous statement . doctors were always saying things like that -- sweeping things which nervous people took too literally . it was true that he had been in pretty bad shape at the moment when the words had been spoken .
ruth conceded none of these things . throughout the interview hank sat bolt upright . tucking a pair of shoes of the dreadnought class coyly underneath his chair . and drew suspiciously at turkish cigarettes from [organization] 's case . an air of constraint hung over the party .
approaching nearer , the women concentrated upon him whom they regarded as responsible for the strike . and their aim improved , some of their shots took effect on his person . but most of them on the front of the house . three windows were broken , and it was not until mrs. [female] came and dragged her egg bespattered lord into the passage . banging to the street door behind her .
but the very same plan to the beaver occurred : it had chosen the very same place . yet neither betrayed , by a sign or a word . the disgust that appeared in his face , but the valley grew narrow and narrower still . and the evening got darker and colder . till ( merely from nervousness , not from goodwill ) .
he is crazy to get away into the country and settle down and grow ducks and things . [location] has disappointed him , it is not the place it used to be . until quite lately , when he grew resigned , he used to wander about in a disconsolate sort of way . trying to locate the landmarks of his youth , ( he has not been in england for nearly thirty years ! ) the trouble is , it seems , that about once in every thirty years a sort of craze for change comes over [location] .
we have been visited by all the gentlemen in the neighbourhood . and they have entertained [location] at their houses . not barely with hospitality , but with such marks of cordial affection . as one would wish to find among near relations , after an absence of many years . i told you , in my last , i had projected an excursion to the highlands .
there is more than one pope , there is more than one emperor , there is even more than one living god . walking upon the earth and worshiped in all sincerity by large populations of men . i have seen and talked with two of these beings myself in [location] . and i have the autograph of one of them . it can come good , by and by , i reckon , if i attach it to a `` permit . ''
the fury of the baffled expedition exceeded all bounds . they even wanted to wreak their unreasoning vengeance on this innocent dumb brute . but i stood between them and their prey , menaced by a bristling wall of ice axes and alpenstocks . and proclaimed that there was but one road to this murder , and it was directly over my corpse . even as i spoke i saw that my doom was sealed , except a miracle supervened to divert these madmen from their fell purpose .
long hours of brooding among the red plush settees in the lounge of the hotel magnificent at bingley on the sea had brought about this strange . even morbid , attitude of mind in [male] marlowe . work , he had decided , was the only medicine for his sick soul . here , he felt , in this quiet office , far from the tumult and noise of the world . in a haven of torts and misdemeanours and vic , [male] cap .
there are two ways of saying this sort of thing . and theirs was the second way , so was udo 's , when he answered that he would be delighted . it was just a week later that the famous double wedding was celebrated in euralia . as an occasion for speech making by king merriwig and largesse throwing by queen [female] it demanded and a whole chapter to itself in [female] 's history . i have [male] on my side at last .
these objections did not deter mr dennison . because they were chiefly founded on the supposition . that he would be obliged to lead a life of extravagance and dissipation . which he and his consort equally detested , despised , and determined to avoid -- the objects he had in view . were health of body , peace of mind .
all of a sudden it come to me who the girl looked like . it wuz isabelle , as she stood in front of it . in her long white dress , with her white hands clasped loose in front of her . and her auburn hair pushed back careless from her beautiful face . i see the girl in the picture , or as she would be if she had grown refined and beautiful by sorrow and a sweet patience and reasonableness .
the old lady whirled round , and snatched her skirts out of danger . the lad fled on the instant , scrambled up the high board fence . and disappeared over it , his aunt [female] stood surprised a moment . and then broke into a gentle laugh , [male] did play hookey . and he had a very good time , he got back home barely in season to help jim .
[female] was dressing for a concert at the white sands hotel . the guests had got it up in aid of the charlottetown hospital . and had hunted out all the available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it along . [female] and pearl clay of the white sands baptist choir had been asked to sing a duet . [female] of newbridge was to give a violin solo .
through the crack in the door mr. [male] could see the top of the washstand beside which mr. [male] was sitting . but he could not see mr. [male] , as he stared . however , he saw a plump hand appear and pick up . one by one , the articles lying on the washstand , they were . first , seven or eight half shells of english walnuts .
arnold , who had been deprived of his command since the last battle , probably to prevent his wiping out the entire enemy and getting promoted . was so maddened by the conflict that he dashed in before gates could put him in the guard house . and at the head of his old command , and without authority or hat . led the attack , gates did not dare to come where arnold was . to order him back , for it was a very warm place where arnold was at the time .
by which this fraternizing of the races had been always known , it was evident that a book advocating amalgamation would fall still born . and hence some new and novel word had to be discovered , with the same meaning . but not so objectionable , such a word was coined by the combination of the latin miscere . to mix , and genus , race : from these , miscegenation -- a mingling of the races . the word is as euphonious as `` amalgamation , '' and much more correct in meaning .
they are all so unreliable in this respect , it must be most disheartening to the murderers . as for the young man that is coming home to see his girl , you simply can not kill him . [male] was a summer rose compared with him . nature and mankind have not sufficient materials in hand as yet to kill that man . science has but the strength of a puling babe against his invulnerability .
this was glory , but there was sorrow ahead , he had not really begun learning the river as yet he had only steered under directions . he had known that to learn the river would be hard , but he had never realized quite how hard . serenely he had undertaken the task of mastering twelve hundred miles of the great . changing , shifting river as exactly and as surely by daylight or darkness as one knows the way to his own features . nobody could realize the full size of that task .
it came to a vote , and it was stricken out . two to one in the vote , when that was done , then the general conference of our church submitted to the membership of the church the question of lay delegation . but back of the question of lay delegation was as grave a question . and that was granting the right of suffrage to the women of the church . the general conference assumed the responsibility of giving to the women the right to vote .
i got all the information out of these gentlemen that we could need . and then , to make everything complete , i asked them if a body could get hold of a little fruit and milk here and there . in case of necessity , they threw up their hands in speechless intimation that the road was simply paved with refreshment peddlers . we were impatient to get away , now , and the rest of our two hour stop rather dragged . but finally the set time arrived and we began the ascent .
having wiped his face and hands upon the roller towel , he walked softly across the kitchen . opened the door , listened , stepped out into the passage and , finally , proceeded to tiptoe upstairs . outside the bedroom door he paused and listened again . his ear pressed against the panel , there was no sound . with the stealth of a burglar he turned the handle .
these two details , taken in connection with the fact that for his extraordinary offense the only punishment he got from the east [location] company 's government was a solemn official `` reprimand '' . suggest the suspicion that he was a european of consequence . the same public document which contained the reprimand gave warning that future offenders of his sort . if in the company 's service , would be dismissed ; and if merchants . suffer revocation of license and exile to england .
muscle and nerve that pulled the crew together and won the race . when at lord 's the match was nearly over , and the light blues had won all but the shouting , [male] went in last man and rattled up fifty in half an hour and won the match . when at the oxford union he spoke upon the very question now before the house . namely , whether a tax should be imposed upon periwinkles -- his oratory alone turned the scale .
`` certainly not ; certainly not , '' said the doctor , and then the interview was at an end . we know what had come of these arguments , he had hitherto never left her for a moment since that man had again appeared before their eyes . he had been strong in his resolution , if it were a crime . then he would be a criminal , if it were a falsehood . then would he be a liar , as to the sin .
mr. president , i hate to write to you in this tone of voice . because i know the pain it will give you . i once held an office myself , mr. president . and it hurt my feelings very much to have a warm personal friend criticise my official acts . the worst feature of the whole thing , mr. president .
this failure caused a tremendous flurry in banking circles . it was but natural that questions concerning the stability of other banks should be asked . and it was not long before many wild , disquieting reports were afloat , anxious depositors rushed into the big banking institutions and then rushed out again . partially assured that there was no danger , the newspapers sought to allay the fears of the people . but there were many to whom fear became panic , there were short , wild runs on some of the smaller banks .
he had spent several hours shaking hands with total strangers and receiving with a frozen smile their felicitations on the attainment of his majority . and he could not have been called upon to meet a larger horde of relations than had surged round him that night if he had been a rabbit . the belpher connection was wide , straggling over most of england . and first cousins , second cousins and even third and fourth cousins had debouched from practically every county on the map and marched upon the home of their ancestors . the effort of having to be civil to all of these had told upon percy .
the plash of the oars was the only sound . and they found themselves listening to it . they disembarked , and , by a winding path , ascended the pine crested mound which overlooked the water . whose white expanse glittered between the trees , the place was delightfully cool . and had the added charm that -- in the softly sounding pine boughs -- you seemed to hear the coolness as well as feel it .
he detected a look in his friend 's face which excited his suspicion . and was about to slip a stiletto into him when [male] saved himself by explaining that that look was only an expression of supreme and happy astonishment . stammato made [male] a present of one of the state 's principal jewels . a huge carbuncle , which afterward figured in the ducal cap of state . and the pair parted , [male] went at once to the palace .
without a courier , travel has not a ray of pleasure in it , anywhere . but with him it is a continuous and unruffled delight . he is always at hand , never has to be sent for ; if your bell is not answered promptly . and it seldom is -- you have only to open the door and speak . the courier will hear , and he will have the order attended to or raise an insurrection .
he was even surer about it the morning after . when he was trying to be grave and paternal with his daughters at breakfast . at noontime he was less sure , he did not deny that he had been a fool . he saw it almost as clearly as at midnight . but anything , he struggled , was better than going back to a life of barren heartiness .
how [female] had discovered the existence of mervo is not known . it lay well outside the sphere of the ordinary financier . but mr. [male] took a pride in the versatility of his finance . it distinguished him from the uninspired who were content to concentrate themselves on steel . wheat and such like things , it was mr. [male] 's way to consider nothing as lying outside his sphere .
if nothing else had happened to spoil the success of that sortie . the nugget 's depressing attitude would have done so , of all things . it seems to me , a forlorn hope should be undertaken with a certain enthusiasm and optimism if it is to have a chance of being successful . ogden threw a gloom over the proceedings from the start . he was cross and sleepy .
at the station , the crowd mash one another to pulp in the effort to get the weigher 's attention to their trunks . they dispute hotly with these tyrants , who are cool and indifferent ; they get their baggage billets . at last , and then have another squeeze and another rage over the disheartening business of trying to get them recorded and paid for . and still another over the equally disheartening business of trying to get near enough to the ticket office to buy a ticket . and now , with their tempers gone to the dogs , they must stand penned up and packed together .
the fowls , however , had disappeared as suddenly as they had come , and thereafter [male] realised that it was neither safe nor politic to refer to the subject . it had taken a plate of rice . hurled at his head from the other side of the kitchen . to bring him to this philosophical frame of mind . for weeks afterwards , the children of fenton street would greet mrs. [female] 's appearance with strange crowing noises .
the materialistic sociologists , who talk about the survival of the fittest and the weakest going to the wall ( and whose way of looking at the world is to put on the latest and most powerful scientific spectacles . and then shut their eyes ) , frequently talk as if a workman were simply efficient or non efficient . as if a criminal were reclaimable or irreclaimable , the employers have sense enough at least to know better than that . they can see that a servant may be useful in one way and exasperating in another . that he may be bad in one part of his work and good in another .
and , as they passed by that dark wood , one knight of those that rode . missing his comrades , wandered far away , and returned to them no more ; and they . sorely grieving , rode on without him , mourning him as one dead . now , when they reached the fair castle towards which they had been journeying . they stayed there many days , and made merry .
the fact is , then , that [female] tinling had the best of reasons for being cool and courageous on the previous occasion . those indians were entirely imaginary ; he had written the warning himself . and instructed the coachman 's boy to throw it over the stockade . the attack on the fort and the brilliant victory were an afterthought . what had he done it for ? that is rather difficult to explain -- perhaps he hardly knew himself .
had i slept ? and what was the loud noise which startled me so that i had nearly let go my hold ? i roused myself -- i looked around . i was tossing up and down with a regular motion , but could see nothing clearly . i was no longer carried forward so swiftly as before , but the dim light prevented me making out the place i was now in . suddenly , a flash broke from the black clouds , and for a single moment shed a blue light over everything .
with the pastries and so on , the heavy drinking began -- and the talk . gallon after gallon of wine and mead disappeared . and everybody got comfortable , then happy , then sparklingly joyous -- both sexes , -- and by and by pretty noisy . men told anecdotes that were terrific to hear , but nobody blushed . and when the nub was sprung , the assemblage let go with a horse laugh that shook the fortress .
seated about the table are six men , dressed in the height of fashion . each with collar and white necktie and broad white shirt . their faces stamped with all , or nearly all , of the baser passions of mankind . lord wynchgate -- for he it was who sat at the head of the table . rose with an oath , and flung his cards upon the table .
this ordeal by oath was reserved for people of eminence . whose word went for something , and who had a good many thorough going friends . another sort of ordeal was reserved for priests . it was called corsned , the priest who took the ordeal by corsned received a bit of bread or a bit of cheese which was loaded heavily . by way of sauce , with curses upon whomsoever should eat it falsely .
there was a rehearsal call for the whole company at eleven , as he dressed . his mood was as sunny as the day itself . and the day , by half past ten , was as sunny as ever spring day had been in a country where spring comes early and does its best from the very start . the blue sky beamed down on a happy city , to and fro the citizenry bustled . aglow with the perfection of the weather , everywhere was gaiety and good cheer .
doctor [male] himself could have deduced it from the evidence . the honorable freddie had fallen downstairs , with a little ingenuity this portion of the story of mr. [male] scarab could be converted into an excellent tract , driving home the perils . even in this world , of absenting one 's self from church on sunday morning . if the honorable freddie had gone to church he would not have been running down the great staircase at the castle at this hour .
the programme was quite varied , negro minstrelsy , sleight of hand , opera bouffe . high tragedy , and that oriental style of quadrille called the khan khan . if my sluggish memory be not at fault , formed the principal attractions of the evening . at about 10:30 or 11 o'clock the khan khan was produced upon the stage , in the midst of it a tall man rose up at the back of the [male] . and came firmly down the aisle with a large , earnest revolver in his right hand .
mr flosky fixed his eyes on a door at the farther end of the library . the company looked in the same direction , the door silently opened . and a ghastly figure , shrouded in white drapery , with the semblance of a bloody turban on its head . entered and stalked slowly up the apartment , mr flosky . familiar as he was with ghosts , was not prepared for this apparition .
we boys wanted to warn them , but we backed down when it came to the pinch , being afraid . we found that we were not manly enough nor brave enough to do a generous action when there was a chance that it could get [location] into trouble . neither of [location] confessed this poor spirit to the others . but did as other people would have done -- dropped the subject and talked about something else . and i knew we all felt mean , eating and drinking marget 's fine things along with those companies of spies .
it is a country that is rich in mines . wool ranches , trams , railways . steamship lines , schools , newspapers . botanical gardens , art galleries . libraries , museums , hospitals , learned societies .
other features grow abnormal , or shrink up from the lack of use . as a result of our customs , for instance . the man whose business it is to get along a crowded street with the utmost speed will have . finally , a hard , sharp horn growing on each elbow , and a pair of spurs growing out of each ankle . these will enable him to climb over a crowd and get there early , constant exposure to these weapons on the part of the pedestrian will harden the walls of the thorax and abdomen until the coming man will be an impervious man .
monk , immediately after his arrival , had accepted the proposition made by lambert the evening before . for an interview , and which monk 's lieutenants had refused under the pretext that the general was indisposed . this interview was neither long nor interesting : lambert demanded a profession of faith from his rival . the latter declared he had no other opinion than that of the majority . lambert asked if it would not be more expedient to terminate the quarrel by an alliance than by a battle .
the bookseller said he had not a set in the world , comment ! said i , taking one up out of a set which lay upon the counter betwixt us. . he said they were sent him only to be got bound . and were to be sent back to versailles in the morning to the count [male] b . - and does the count [male] b .
the amorous pair were sorely disconcerted , and the alguazil , inveighing against the enormity of their conduct . ordered them to dress with all speed , and go with him to prison . the breton was dismayed , the attorney interceded from motives of compassion . and prevailed on the alguazil to commute the penalty for only a hundred reals . the breton called for a pair of leather breeches he had laid on a chair at the end of the room .
it happens also in the autumn when his wife is in [location] playing golf in order to restore her shattered nerves after the fatigues of the seaside . it occurs again in november when his wife is in the adirondacks to get the benefit of the altitude . and later on through the winter when she is down in [location] to get the benefit of the latitude . the breaking up of the winter being , notoriously , a trying time on the system . any reasonable man is apt to consent to his wife 's going to [location] .
but sometimes there would be a passenger for simsbury , and the proud train would slow down and halt reluctantly . with a grinding of brakes , while the passenger alighted . then a good view of the train could be had ; a line of beautiful sleepers terminating in an observation car . its rear platform guarded by a brass topped railing behind which the privileged lolled at ease . and up ahead a wonderful dining car , where dinner was being served .
The Triumphs of Eugene Valmont by [female] at [organization] the attribution and the table of contents are not part of the original book . when i say i am called valmont , the name will convey no impression to the reader . one way or another , my occupation is that of private detective in [location] . but if you ask any policeman in [location] who valmont was he will likely be able to tell you . unless he is a recent recruit , if you ask him where valmont is now .
this impressive little speech had a decided and instant effect upon the `` medium . '' gentlemen , said the latter , i might as well own up . please to be quietly seated , and i will tell you all about it . and he did tell them all about it . subsequently repeating his confession before quite a number of disgusted and cheaply sold spiritualists at the `` [location] spiritual lyceum . ''
but one must not anticipate , pupkin reached the iron door of the bank safe . and knelt in front of it . feeling in the dark to find the fracture of the lock . as he knelt , he heard a sound behind him . and swung round on his knees and saw the bank robber in the half light of the passage way and the glitter of a pistol in his hand .
there was an uproar going on when [female] opened the door . but it died away as he appeared , and the dormitory gazed at the newcomer in absolute and embarrassing silence . [male] had not felt so conscious of the public eye being upon him since he had gone out to bat against the m.c.c. . on his first appearance in the ranks of the eckleton eleven . he went to his bed and began to undress without a word .
she heard cries of fear and of warning on all sides . but before she understood her danger she was knocked down and dragged for half a block . when the car was brought to a stop a policeman reached down and pulled her from under the wheels . her dress was badly torn and soiled , her left ear was entirely gone , and the left side of her head was caved in . but she quickly scrambled to her feet and asked for her hat .
still less has he the moral courage to wear his coat of arms . the whole thing now is only a vague hotch potch of nice and nasty gentlemen . the nice gentleman never refers to anyone else 's father . the nasty gentleman never refers to his own , that is the only difference . the rest is the public school manner , but [male] and harrow have to be aristocratic because they consist so largely of parvenues .
no longer was he a trembling , tongue tied captive . scorning himself for his want of will , he was a free man . the affianced husband of the most wonderful creature in the world . in his exultation he raised his lantern aloft and swung it round and round with the abandon of a boy who tosses his cap in the air . then he bounded down the iron staircase like a child let out of school .
if in the future we see [location] annexing rutland ( as part of the old kingdom of muscovy ) . if we see bavaria taking a sudden fancy to [organization] . or the king of the cannibal islands suddenly demanding a tribute of edible boys and girls from england and [location] . we may be quite certain also that the leader of the labour party will rise . with a slight cough , and say : `` it would be a difficult task to apportion the blame between the various claims which ... ''
so the next morning when the potato face blind man sat down to play his accordion on the corner nearest the postoffice in the village of liver and onions . next to him on the right hand side sitting on the sidewalk was poker face the baboon and on the left hand side sitting next to him was hot dog the tiger . they looked like dummies -- they were so quiet . they looked as if they were made of wood and paper and then painted . in the eyes of poker face was something faraway .
galilei , commonly called galileo , was born at pisa on the 14th day of february , 1564 . he was the man who discovered some of the fundamental principles governing the movements . habits , and personal peculiarities of the earth . he discovered things with marvelous fluency . born as he was , at a time when the rotary motion of the earth was still in its infancy and astronomy was taught only in a crude way .
after all , in the atlantic there is wireless telegraphy , and a lot of trained sailors and stewards . but out on lake wissanotti , -- far out , so that you can only just see the lights of the town away off to the south . when the propeller comes to a stop , -- and you can hear the hiss of steam as they start to rake out the engine fires to prevent an explosion . and when you turn from the red glare that comes from the furnace doors as they open them . to the black dark that is gathering over the lake , -- and there 's a night wind beginning to run among the rushes .
it was after nancy 's father had left her . and when the bright summer days were beginning to close , that one afternoon teddy and nancy were fishing together . at least that was their intention , but any one seeing them sitting on the low stone bridge over the river . with their lines dangling carelessly in the water , and their merry laughter and voices ringing out continually . would not be surprised if their fishing did not meet with success , at last they clambered down and wandered along the tow path .
[male] was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years . but there was no getting around it -- here were the certified checks , and they were good for their face . [male] was therefore elevated to a place with the judge and the other elect . and the great news was announced from headquarters , it was the most stunning surprise of the decade . and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one 's altitude .
what was needed to straighten matters out , i perceived , was a heart to heart talk with angela . she had caused all the trouble by her mutton headed behaviour in saying `` yes '' instead of `` no '' when gussie . in the grip of mixed drinks and cerebral excitement . had suggested teaming up , she must obviously be properly ticked off and made to return him to store . a quarter of an hour later , i had tracked her down to the summer house in which she was taking a cooler and was seating myself by her side .
such is the description that may safely be given of the french ladies in general . but the spirit , or rather the evil genius of gallantry . too often perverts all these lovely qualities , and renders them subservient to very iniquitous ends . in every country , women have always a little to do , and a great deal to say . in [female] , they dictate almost every thing that is said .
[female] stood in the doorway . looking uncommonly foolish , he had wanted , in coming there , to enjoy the contrast between the past and present . which accounts for a good many visits of `` old boys '' to the scene of their education . but , confronted with his former schoolfellows , he was seized at first with an utterly unreasonable fear of detection . the class behaved as classes usually do on such occasions .
then he sued the town for dollar 50,000 damages because the sidewalk was imperfect . and the wild eyed man with the inflamed nose got on the jury , i will not explain how it was done . but there was a verdict for defendant with costs on the esculapian wreck . the man with the crooked vision is not handsome , but he is very happy . he says the [male] of the gods grind slowly .
at those times , as the howlings and wailings and shrieking of the singers . and the ragings and roarings and explosions of the vast orchestra rose higher and higher . and wilder and wilder , and fiercer and fiercer . i could have cried if i had been alone , those strangers would not have been surprised to see a man do such a thing who was being gradually skinned . but they would have marveled at it here , and made remarks about it no doubt .
filled with a joyous sense of achievement and conscious of a kindly deed worthily performed . i took my little cousin by her hand and led her home . my mother was waiting for [location] at the front door . she seemed surprised when i took off my hat and gave her a look . but that was not a circumstance to her surprise when i proudly took off my little cousin 's cap .
she would not look again , her heart was in a glow . and she feared her face might be as hot . his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky . if it had not been for the cruel state of things before . and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced .
i have been called upon several times to make the amende honorable . and i admit that it is not an occasion of much mirth and merriment . people who come into the editorial office to invest in a retraction are generally healthy . and have a stiff , reserved manner that no cheerfulness or hospitality can soften . i remember an incident of this kind which occurred last summer in my office while i was writing something scathing .
to each it will seem that it is the other who is growing colder . [male] sees with bitterness that [location] no longer runs to the gate to meet him . all smiles and blushes ; and when he has a cough now she does not begin to cry and . putting her arms round his neck , say that she can not live without him . the most she will probably do is to suggest a lozenge , and even that in a tone implying that it is the noise more than anything else she is anxious to get rid of .
the fierce rapidity of the stream finally carried [location] out of the reach of the infuriated barghîz ( who , moreover . were providentially slain by lightning -- a common enough occurrence in that favoured climate , where nobody thinks anything of it ) . and we rested , weary and wounded , in a sheltered backwater , no ; all right . it is a tremendous country for storms . can not use them too often ; adds to the sense of reality. , ed .
it was one of those plays which start wrong and never recover , by the end of the first ten minutes there had spread through the theatre that uneasy feeling which comes over the audience at an opening performance when it realizes that it is going to be bored . a sort of lethargy had gripped the stalls . the dress circle was coughing , up in the gallery there was grim silence . the acting did nothing to dispel the growing uneasiness , sir chester himself . apparently oppressed by the weightiness of the occasion and the responsibility of offering an unfamiliar brand of goods to his public .
having first , therefore , laid violent hands on the horses , for whose escape from the stable no place but the window was left open . he next applied himself to his sister . softened and soothed her , by unsaying all he had said , and by assertions directly contrary to those which had incensed her . lastly , he summoned the eloquence of sophia to his assistance . who , besides a most graceful and winning address , had the advantage of being heard with great favour and partiality by her aunt .
it is not , perhaps , easy for a reader , who hath never been in those circumstances . to imagine the horror with which darkness , rain , and wind . fill persons who have lost their way in the night . and who , consequently , have not the pleasant prospect of warm fires , dry cloaths . and other refreshments , to support their minds in struggling with the inclemencies of the weather .
i had learned to let liquor alone , and was consequently in far less , indeed , next to no danger of stepping into the traps in which my feet had been so often caught . i may as well confess it -- it was intoxicating liquor . and that mainly , which had led me into my various mad marrying schemes and made me the matrimonial monomaniac and lunatic lover that i was for years . what my folly , my insanity caused me to suffer , these pages have attempted to portray . i had grown older , wiser , and certainly better , i now only devoted myself strictly to my business .
their tall spare frames have given rise to the term bony [location] . supposed by some to be derived from `` bonnet , '' the national headgear , the principal products of [location] are porridge . parsons and pilbrochs , the inhabitants of [location] are the most moral and patriotic people in the world . and their army is second to none in bravery and won the world war . [location] is the land of the irish bull .
until the sun has really got to work , it is no joke taking a high catch . stone 's dislike of the experiment was only equaled by robinson 's . they were neither of them of the type which likes to undergo hardships for the common good . they played well enough when on the field , but neither cared greatly whether the school had a good season or not . they played the games entirely for their own sakes .
the policeman waved his hand , the car jerked forward . the sudden movement brought him to himself . he smiled , a little ashamed of having been so fanciful ; the sky was blue . the sun shone ; a cool breeze put the joy of life into him . and at his side ruth sat , smiling now , from her , too , the cloud had been lifted .
and there wuz a place where we could see a miner 's cabin . and miners at work , blasting , draining , driving tunnels . drilling , traveling underground , a gold mill . a new mexican turquoise mine ; a lead . zinc and copper mine .
the smile was struck from her face , as it flew open . inside it were billows and billows of the finest possible muslin . fold after fold of it she drew out . and with it there came a pair of false eyebrows . she recognised them at once as being amadeo 's .
and thus they were discovered by a foray of [organization] . headed by [organization] and herman and followed by the bonded prisoners . [female] and georgie [female] . these and others caught sight of the writhing figures . and charged down upon them with loud cries of triumph , `` pris'ner , pris'ner , bonded pris'ner ! ''
the mildest tempered people , when on land , become violent and blood thirsty when in a boat . i did a little boating once with a young lady . she was naturally of the sweetest and gentlest disposition imaginable , but on the river it was quite awful to hear her . and , `` oh , bother the silly old thing , '' she would say indignantly . when the sail would not go up properly , and she would catch hold of it .
the news reached [location] in the night . and when the watchman cried , `` past two o'clock , and cornwallis is taken ! '' the people arose and went and prayed and laughed like lunatics , for they regarded the war as virtually ended . the old door keeper of [organization] died of delight . thanks were returned to almighty god , and person nomination was a sure thing .
the supper was an exquisite one , but the appetites of those dreadful children effectually prevented my enjoying the repast . i hastily retired , called the girl , and instructed , her to see that the children had enough to eat . and were put to bed immediately after ; then i lit a cigar and strolled into the garden . the roses were just in bloom , the air was full of the perfume of honeysuckles . the rhododendrons had not disappeared , while i saw promise of the early unfolding of many other pet flowers of mine .
mr montague was going to retort , when [male] handed him the paper . and said , with quiet exultation in his tone , we will begin at the beginning . and take that one first , if you please , sir , the chairman cast his eyes upon it . coldly , and with a smile which did not render any great homage to the slow and methodical habits of his spy . but he had not read half a dozen lines when the expression of his face began to change .
but now that the boy had discovered his identity it was impossible for him to attempt it . he was loth to accept this fact , surely , even now , there was a way . a few moments later the door opened , [male] looked up . it was not his father , it was a dangerous looking female of uncertain age . dressed as a parlour maid , who eyed him with what seemed to his conscience stricken soul dislike and suspicion .
fourteen jewish confederate and union families contributed . between them , fifty one soldiers to the war . among these , a father and three sons ; and another , a father and four sons . in the above article i was neither able to endorse nor repel the common approach that the jew is willing to feed upon a country but not to fight for it . because i did not know whether it was true or false , i supposed it to be true .
[male] himself with an effort . his face was drawn and gloomy , he sat down at the writing table , and took out his check book . there was silence for a moment , broken only by the scratching of the pen . [male] took the check and left the room . derek rose without speaking , he took his coat and hat from where they lay on a chair .
it was in the low and miserable hut we speak of . just as night set in of a raw november , that four of these raftsmen sat at their smoky fire . in company with two travellers on foot . whose humble means compelled them to await the arrival of some one rich enough to hire the raft . meanly clad and wayworn were the strangers who now sat endeavoring to dry their dripping clothes at the blaze .
he did not reflect that this was hardly the way in which valets in the best society addressed their superiors . that is the worst of adopting what might be called a character part , one can manage the business well enough . it is the dialogue that provides the pitfalls . mr. [male] would have accorded a hearty agreement to the statement that this was not the way in which a valet should have spoken to him . but at the moment he was not aware that ashe was a valet .
in spite of herself , in spite of a feeling that this young woman was straying from the point . mrs. [female] could not check a slight influx of amiability . she was an authoress who received a good deal of incense from admirers . but she could always do with a bit more , besides , most of the incense came by mail . living a quiet and retired life in the country , it was rarely that she got it handed to her face to face .
the poor knight can only manifest his rank by his virtues and general conduct . he must be well bred , courteous , kind , and obliging ; not proud nor arrogant , no murmurer . above all , he must be charitable , and by two maravedis given cheerfully to the poor he shall display as much generosity as the rich man who bestows large alms by sound of bell . of such a man no one would doubt his honorable descent . and general applause wall be the sure reward of his virtue .
mr. [male] observed , that his duty was rather laborious . as he served another parish church at a distance . which , with the sunday and weekly service at [organization] . straitened him much with respect to the time necessary for the composition of sermons . so that when the subjects pressed , he could only devote a few days and nights to that purpose .
i received a terrible beating -- after which i rolled under a sofa and lay still . after lying there some fifteen minutes , during which time i listened with all my ears to what was going on in the room . i came to same satisfactory denouement of this tragedy . monsieur maillard , it appeared . in giving me the account of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion .
`` 'm -- yes , '' said the young man , it seemed to [male] that he spoke doubtfully . and this modesty consolidated the favourable impression she had formed . the gods are just , for every ill which they inflict they also supply a compensation . it seems good to them that individuals in big cities shall be lonely . but they have so arranged that , if one of these individuals does at last contrive to seek out and form a friendship with another .
he will fawn under his rider one moment . and throw him and kick him to death the next . but another adventurer springs on his back . and by dint of whip and spur on he goes as before . we may , without much vanity , hope better of ourselves .
my family resemble me in that respect . the less you see of us , the better we look . indoor golf is that which is played in the home , whether you live in a palace or a hovel . an indoor golf course , be it only of nine holes . is well within your reach , a house offers greater facilities than an apartment .
mr chollop was a man of a roving disposition . and , in any less advanced community , might have been mistaken for a violent vagabond . but his fine qualities being perfectly understood and appreciated in those regions where his lot was cast . and where he had many kindred spirits to consort with , he may be regarded as having been born under a fortunate star . which is not always the case with a man so much before the age in which he lives .
there will be two more awakenings that night -- once at batavia . where a merry wedding party with horns and cow bells will follow the lucky bride and groom into your car . and once at schenectady , where the pullman car shock absorbing tests are held . the next morning , tired but unhappy , you will reach [location] . grant 's tomb , take fifth avenue bus .
so by a formal deed he there conveyed all right and title in his natal day . to have and hold , to sell or give away , -- then signed , and gave it to the little maid . joyful , yet fearing to believe too much , she took the deed . but scarcely dared unfold , ah , liberal genius , at whose potent touch all common things shine with transmuted gold ! a day of [female] 's will prove to be not part of time , but immortality .
at about 5.30 a. m. , however , i became conscious that my nephews were not in accord . with me on the sinaitic law , they were not only awake . but were disputing vigorously , and , seemingly , very loudly , for i heard their words very distinctly . with sleepy condescension i endeavored to ignore these noisy irreverents . but i was suddenly moved to a belief in the doctrine of vicarious atonement .
it was over this matter of pictures that i had first met her . for her father owned a palace on the farther side of the rialto bridge upon the grand canal . and it was so packed with wall paintings that suchet sent a party of sappers to cut some of them out and send them to [location] . and now i will tell you how my love for [female] was the cause of one of the most terrible of all the wonderful adventures which have ever befallen me . and how it was that i came to lose the top of my right ear .
with pleasant conversation he endeavoured to while away the monotony of the journey . but [male] made no reply , he was doing some rapid thinking . with ordinary luck , he felt bitterly , all would have been well , he could have gone on splashing vigorously under his teacher 's care for a week . gradually improving till he emerged into a reasonably proficient swimmer , but now ! in an age of miracles he might have explained away his present performance .
his earnings were enough just to keep his head above water . but not enough to make [location] two one , perhaps , because everything is clear and easy for [location] now . i am gradually losing a proper appreciation of his struggle . that should never be , he did not win , but he did not lose . which means nearly as much , for it is almost less difficult to win than not to lose .
the other phenomena of the drawing room which particularly interested [female] were the [location] carpet . the four vast easy chairs , the sofa , the imposing cigar cabinet and the mechanical piano player . at one brief period he had hovered a good deal about the revolving bookcase containing the encyclopaedia ( to which his collection of books was limited ) . but the frail passion for literature had not survived a struggle with the seductions of the mechanical piano player . the one ornament of the walls which attracted him was a large and splendidly framed oil painting of a ruined castle .
the next thing he knew was that drama with a capital `` d '' had taken a hand in the game . the crowd drew its breath with almost a sob of surprised expectancy . into [male] 's vacant eyes there came a look of interest . and into the big man 's mouth , just as he turned his head . there came a something that was wet and tasted odiously of carbolic , he staggered back .
as i was speaking to the [female] in the engine room i noticed a couple of horses standing there . one of them was a grey mare with a most cunning look . and as the [female] was informing me that `` she had done continuous work here for some years , '' she gave me an artful wink of confirmation . just at that moment the alarm bell suddenly vibrated .
eve had not that consolation , meagre fare . moreover , had the effect of accentuating mrs. [organization] always rather pronounced irritability . she was a massive lady , with a prominent forehead . some half dozen chins , and a manner towards those in her employment which would have been resented in a second mate by the crew of a western ocean tramp . even at her best she was no ray of sunshine about the house .
it was in the morning ; mr. [male] was in his office . and , on going in , [female] found that [female] was at that moment in conference with her father . she had , in fact , been constantly near him since her interview with [female] . she had made up her mind that it was her duty to repeat very literally her cousin 's passionate plea . she had accordingly followed mr. [male] about like a shadow .
`` shall we open it at once ? '' enquired the artist . who had grown decidedly cheerful under the combined effects of company and gin . and without waiting for a reply , he began to strip as if for a prize fight . tossed his clerical collar in the wastepaper basket . hung his clerical coat upon a nail , and with a chisel in one hand and a hammer in the other .
by this time the annunciator had grown to formidable dimensions . it had forty-seven tags on it . marked with the names of the various rooms and chimneys . and it occupied the space of an ordinary wardrobe . the gong was the size of a wash bowl .
mr. [male] suspected that miss [female] was proud . and that she regarded such a gift as savoring too much of charity . mr. [male] wished he could say something to miss [male] . mr. [male] was , indeed , not a little disturbed over the matter . he did try once to say something .
after id lissened to that for about half an hour i felt like the gate gard of a bug house . i got hold of the lootenant in a friendly way an told him id go halves on my bunk with him cause i didnt think it was safe to sleep with that fello . he might think he was a crum some night an try to choke somebody . the lootenant said that was just a way they had of telefonin up here . he said you never could tell when a german might be lyin up on the roof or under a bunk lissenin to you .
[male] the red was a northman , and he flourished about the ninth century . and before the war , he sailed around in that country for several years . drinking bay rum and bear 's oil and having a good time . he wore fur underclothes all the time . winter and summer , and evaded the poll tax for a long time .
general [female] then took command , and drove price to springfield . but he was in a short time replaced by general hunter . because his war policy was offensive to the enemy . hunter was soon afterwards removed , and major general halleck took his place . halleck gave general satisfaction to the enemy .
we went slipping silently along , between the green and fragrant banks , with a sense of pleasure and contentment that grew . and grew , all the time , sometimes the banks were overhung with thick masses of willows that wholly hid the ground behind . sometimes we had noble hills on one hand . clothed densely with foliage to their tops , and on the other hand open levels blazing with poppies . or clothed in the rich blue of the corn flower ; sometimes we drifted in the shadow of forests .
the question was a puzzler , she did not know why she had not . the thing had never come up in her mind , so here she was . forecasting the veritable history of future prisoners of the castle d'if . without knowing it , it seemed plain to me now . that with her training , those inherited prisoners were merely property .
[female] , in the darkness within , heaved a sigh of relief . he was in , anyway ; how he was going to get out he was not quite sure . he stood for a few minutes in rapt admiration of his own cleverness . he would scored off cook , crumbs ! he would scored off cook ! so far , at any rate , the first thing to do was to find the cream blanc mange .
[female] looked as if he could not believe his own ears . just then the voice of [male] the tree toad began to croak it 's going to rain ! it 's going to rain , it 's going to rain , the voice seemed to come out of that very same hemlock tree . everybody noticed it and looked up at the tree . and while they were all trying to see [male] , something dropped plop right into their midst .
at last mellish collected the papers , he seemed a trifle surprised when i gave up my modest three sheets . [male] and [male] , who had their eye on the form prize . each gave up reams , [male] told me subsequently that he had only had time to do sixteen sheets . and wanted to know whether i had adopted rutherford 's emendation in preference to the old reading in question ii . my prolonged stay had made him regard me as a possible rival .
to do the best he could for himself and his family . and also to do his duty , -- was the line of conduct which he pursued . there are some who reverse this order , but he was not one of them . he had become a scholar in his youth . not from love of scholarship , but as a means to success .
in the ante room were the outposts , the pickets of the enemy . in one corner a girl was hammering energetically and with great speed on a typewriter . a second girl , seated at a switchboard , was having an argument with central which was already warm and threatened to descend shortly to personalities . on a chair tilted back so that it rested against the wall . a small boy sat eating candy and reading the comic page of an evening newspaper .
i got to set still and float , and yet it 's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time . i whooped and listened , away down there somewheres i hears a small whoop . and up comes my spirits , i went tearing after it , listening sharp to hear it again . the next time it come i see i war not heading for it . but heading away to the right of it , and the next time i was heading away to the left of it .
but gottfried was the worst -- he could not stand , he was so weak and scared . for he was of a witch family . you know , and it would be bad for him to be suspected . agnes came loafing in , looking pious and unaware , and wanted to rub up against ursula and be petted . but ursula was afraid of her and shrank away from her , but pretending she was not meaning any incivility .
after all , a boy has to learn the facts of sex some time or other . and [organization] has been felicitious enough in jurgen to present them not only as beautiful . but merry as well , those elements ought to be present in everybody 's sex education . the new knowledge comes to almost all youngsters as a distinct shock . because , while the things their boy companions tell them may be merry enough .
it was one of those plays which start wrong and never recover , by the end of the first ten minutes there had spread through the theatre that uneasy feeling which comes over the audience at an opening performance when it realises that it is going to be bored . a sort of lethargy had gripped the stalls . the dress circle was coughing , up in the gallery there was grim silence . the acting did nothing to dispel the growing uneasiness , sir chester himself . apparently oppressed by the weightiness of the occasion and the responsibility of offering an unfamiliar brand of goods to his public .
have scribbled a still more flourishing [male] all over the document , have asked you if there was nothing more . have stood by you -- supposing that you were paying cash . until the central figure of this story reappeared with the change . one glance more at him , and the puffy little shop walker would have been bowing you out . with fountains of civilities at work all about you .
then chawner , to do him justice , always relieved him from so disagreeable a necessity . and would go softly into the doctor 's study , and , in a subdued and repentant tone . pour out his general confession for the public good , probably the doctor did not altogether respect the instruments he saw fit to use in this way . some would have declined to hear the informer out , flogged him well , and forgotten it . but dr. grimstone -- though he was hardly likely to be impressed by these exhibitions of noble candour .
with this woman he had , during twenty five years . lived a life more resembling the model which certain poets ascribe to the golden age . than any of those patterns which are furnished by the present times , by her he had four children . but none of them arrived at maturity . except only one daughter , whom , in vulgar language , he and his wife had spoiled .
but mrs. [female] had seen him as he stood revealed . and came up in search of peggy , it was almost morning . she told her , and quite time to go back to the hotel and sleep . so in [female] 's charge they wandered off . a bit reluctantly , a bit lingeringly , it was not until [male] was summoned to rescue [male]
the dome on top of it is the biggest dome in the world . with the exception ofpeter 's in rome . and it seemed to me , as i looked up at the dome . that person might have got along with one no bigger than this , howsumever , it hai not for me to scrimp anybody in domes . but this wuz truly enormious , but none too big , mebby , for the nub on top of the gate of the world 's fair .
mr [male] took a keen pride in his powers of observation . he would frequently observe , like the lamented sherlock holmes . the vital necessity of taking notice of trifles . the daily life of a sixth form master at a big public school does not afford much scope for the practice of the detective art . but mr [male] had once detected a piece of cribbing .
perhaps the most pleasant confession i have to make is my fondness for children . they always interest and amuse me more than `` grown-ups . '' the commonplace talk is to them unknown . it is full of surprises , perhaps the nursery 's record of my family is not longer or any more interesting than the sayings and doings of the youngsters of any other family . still a few extracts may interest those who , like myself .
the death of the king at this early age has given to many historians the idea that he was a sad dog . and that he sat up late of nights and cut up like everything . but this may not be true , death often takes the good , the true . and the beautiful whilst young , however , [male] 's reign was a brilliant one for an anglo saxon . and his coon skin cap is said to have cost over a pound sterling .
some people -- not you nor i , because we are so awfully self possessed . but some people , find great difficulty in saying good-bye when making a call or spending the evening . as the moment draws near when the visitor feels that he is fairly entitled to go away he rises and says abruptly . well , i think i ... then the people say , oh , must you go now ? surely it 's early yet , and a pitiful struggle ensues .
but the truth is , i never dreamed of any such commerce , till your last informed me . that it had produced something which could not be much longer concealed , it is a lucky circumstance . however , that her reputation will not suffer any detriment , but rather derive advantage from the discovery . which will prove , at least , that it is not quite so rotten as most people imagined . for my own part , i declare to you .
she was still quite angry when she came out of the dressing room and crossed the intervening parlor of politeness that opened onto the [female] . angry not so much at the actual happening which was , after all , the merest commonplace of her social existence . but because it had occurred on this particular night , she had no quarrel with herself . she had acted with that correct mixture of dignity and reticent pity which she always employed . she had succinctly and deftly snubbed him , it had happened when their taxi was leaving the biltmore .
that evening mrs. [female] and her family made their darling wellesley give a full . true , and particular account of everything that had taken place at lord [male] 's . how many servants waited at dinner ; and how the ladies schneider dressed . and what his royal highness said when he came down to shoot . and who was there ? `` what a blessing that boy is to me ! ''
i am glad to hear that you are not drinking any more , especially while engaged in sleep . if you only confine your drinking to your waking hours . you may live to be a very old man , and your great , massive brain will continue to expand until your hat will not begin to hold it . i will meet you at havre or calais . and agree with you how hard we shall hit each other , i saw .
he rode on until he reached the city . where all the people stood in exactly the same positions they were in when jim lassoed father time . stopping in front of a big dry goods store . the boy hitched his horse and went in , the clerks were measuring out goods and showing patterns to the rows of customers in front of them . but everyone seemed suddenly to have become a statue , there was something very unpleasant in this scene .
just then the first beam of the sun fell upon the blossoms a leetle more . and it techt the roses on the bushes . and the next thing it was broad day . the sun fairly blazed , the birds sung like they would split their little throats . all the leaves was movin ' , and flashin
we therefore decided that we would sleep out on fine nights . and hotel it , and inn it , and pub . it , like respectable folks , when it was wet . or when we felt inclined for a change , montmorency hailed this compromise with much approval . he does not revel in romantic solitude , give him something noisy .
it would be simpler if the conductor should carry a small hammer and a packet of shingle nails and nail the paid up passenger to the back of the seat . or better still , let the conductor carry a small pot of paint and a brush . and mark the passengers in such a way that he can not easily mistake them . in the case of bald headed passengers , the hats might be politely removed and red crosses painted on the craniums . this will indicate that they are bald , through passengers might be distinguished by a complete coat of paint .
Uneasy Money by [female] at [organization] in a day in june . at the hour when [location] moves abroad in quest of lunch . a young man stood at the entrance of the bandolero restaurant looking earnestly up shaftesbury avenue . a large young man in excellent condition , with a pleasant , good humoured , brown , clean cut face . he paid no attention to the stream of humanity that flowed past him .
one could not translate it , he said , it lost so much in the translation that it was better not to try . it was far wiser not to attempt it , if you undertook to translate it . there was something gone , something missing immediately , i believe that many classical scholars feel this way . and like to read the greek just as it is , without the hazard of trying to put it into so poor a medium as english . so that when dean drone said that he simply could not translate it .
we all of us , even the greatest of us . have our moments of weakness , let [location] then not express any surprise at the sudden collapse of one of the world 's greatest female thinkers . as the meaning of this speech smote on mrs. [female] understanding . she sank weeping into a chair , the ever present fear that had haunted her had been exorcised . windles was hers in perpetuity .
such , however , was mr smartle 's course ; and the sole consolation is that . owing to his unprofessional precipitation , the action was set down for trial previously to the commencement of the long vacation . and my case may come on some time next term . and i be put out of my misery at the close of the year . my aforesaid legal adviser , finding that i adhered with the tenacity of bird slime to my determination to conduct my case in person .
[male] at him and drove his pocketknife into him two or three times before the boys could snatch him away and give the wounded lad a chance to escape . he was considerably hurt , but not seriously , if the blade had been a little longer . his career would have ended there , [female] had long ago taught roxy `` her place . '' it had been many a day now since she had ventured a caress or a fondling epithet in his quarter . such things , from a `` nigger , '' were repulsive to him .
benares is older than history , older than tradition . older even than legend , and looks twice as old as all of them put together . from a hindoo statement quoted in rev . mr. [male] 's compact and lucid guide to benares . i find that the site of the town was the beginning place of the creation .
he sat down opposite to her ; she still held her fan up to her face . with her eyes only showing above it , there was a moment 's silence . and then he said , returning to his former question , `` have you sent that document to [location] ? '' again there was a moment 's silence , the expressive eyes of madame m . auunster seemed , however , half to break it .
no higher the roofs of the very towers , up from their tiny segment of the earth 's spinning surface they stood negligible beneath infinity . and new , too , quite new , in eternity ; transient upstarts , i saw oxford as a place that had no more past and no more future than a mining camp . i smiled down , o hoary and unassailable mushroom , ... but if a man carry his sense of proportion far enough , lo ! he is back at the point from which he started . he knows that eternity , as conceived by him .
had he a full church at littlebath depending on him . had mr stumfold 's chance and mr stumfold 's success been his . had he still even been an adherent of the stumfoldian fold . he would have paused before he rushed to the public with an account of miss [location] 's grievance . but as matters stood with him , looking round upon his own horizon .
i could easily perceive from your looks , when i had the honour to converse with you at hatfield . that my character is not unknown to you ; and , i dare say you wo not think it strange . that i should be glad to change my present way of life . for any other honest occupation , let it be ever so humble , that will afford me bread in moderation . and sleep in safety -- perhaps you may think i flatter .
now i will read that item myself , and see if there is any foundation for all this fuss . and if there is , the author of it shall hear from me . i have read it , and i am bound to admit that it seems a little mixed at a first glance . however , i will peruse it once more , i have read it again . and it does really seem a good deal more mixed than ever , i have read it over five times .
the man regarded him with elaborate gravity for a few moments . `` if yer turn yer face away i will try , '' he replied , and proceeded to fashion the duplicates . meanwhile bindle deliberated , if he retained the keys there would be suspicion at the flats . and perhaps locks would be changed ; if , on the other hand , the keys were returned immediately . the owner would trouble himself no further .
he plodded into the house , deliberately went to the refrigerator and rifled it . when mrs. [female] was at home . this was one of the major household crimes , he stood before the covered laundry tubs . eating a chicken leg and half a saucer of [male] . and grumbling over a clammy cold boiled potato , he was thinking .
the kids break out of the rushes behind me . and there 's no use pretending anymore , i flash a look over my shoulder . they all yell , `` ya n h h h , '' like a bunch of wild indians . but they are about fifty feet back , i grab cat hard about the only place you can grab a cat . around one upper forearm , and i really run , the kids let out another war whoop .
here was a man who , living in the closest contact with one of the most difficult persons in [location] . contrived all the while to maintain an unbowed head , and , as far as one could gather from appearances . a tolerably cheerful disposition , a great man , judge him by what standard you pleased . anxious as he was to earn an honest living . archie would not have changed places with parker for the salary of a movie star .
a fat man can not wear the clothes he would like to wear . as a race fat men are fond of bright and cheerful colors . but no fat man can indulge his innocent desires in this direction without grieving his family and friends and exciting the derisive laughter of the unthinking . if he puts on a fancy flowered vest , they will say he looks like a hanging garden of babylon . and yet he has a figure just made for showing off a fancy flowered vest to best effect .
i write , `` then where is he ? '' he waves me away . as mr. [male] is quoting some extraordinary document six hundred years old in reply to sir [male] davey 's authority . which only dates back five hundred and ninety nine years , it suddenly occurs to me that the bishop is beside his counsel at the other end of the long table . but , alas , there is a candle in front of him . this is all i can see , so i make my way to the other side of the table .
`` but how can i get ashore ? '' she asked , with a smile which showed all . or nearly all , of her pearl like teeth , in another moment i had walked back to the raft and lifted her as tenderly and reverently as if she had been my sister . indeed more so -- in my arms , her weight seemed nothing . when i get a girl like that in my arms i simply do not feel it . just for one moment as i clasped her thus in my arms .
i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the person was hid . and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in . then i done the same with the side of bacon ; then the whisky jug . i took all the coffee and sugar there was , and all the ammunition . i took the wadding ; i took the bucket and gourd .
he picked his hat from the lawn . and in his most stately manner walked around the club house and in at the door . inside the club house , mr. [male] asked one of the waiters to call mr. [male] . and mr. [male] immediately appeared , as he came from the dining room rapidly . the napkin he had had tucked in his neck fell over his shoulder behind him .
next day he set about it . and dug so far down in the ground that he could hardly reach the top to climb out again . but not a drop of water was found , `` perhaps you did not dig deep enough , '' his wife said , when he told her of his failure . so the following day he made a long ladder .
it was on the porch of the hotel . too , that he was to have his first scene with [organization] girl whose hand he won . she proved to be the daughter of the old gentleman who liked the improved grape juice . as baird had intimated , she was a large girl . not only tall and stoutly built , but somewhat heavy of face , baird 's heart must have been touched indeed when he consented to employ her .
i need not tell you all that passed between us . and what was said by this dog and by that , about the choice of my occupation . it was agreed at last that i should be appointed chief of the caneville police . as the place had become vacant through the death of a fine old mastiff some days previous . i wonder whether he was a relation of my own , for i have already told you my mother belonged to that great family .
never give expression to your affections , as there is no saying how soon they may alter . and you may thus be guilty of great inconsistency , never consult the taste of your husband . or he will in time come to look on his house as a club . where all is comfort and self indulgence , a little girl , a charming tiny tot . i well remember you with many a curl , although i recollect you said `` i am not a little girl . ''
a young man , with a plated watch chain that would do to tie up a sacred elephant . came into [location] the other day from the east . on the julesburg short line , and told the hotel clerk that he had just returned from [location] . and was on his way across the continent with the intention of publishing a book of international information . he handed an oilcloth grip across the counter .
in [location] `` the boot '' was used , being an iron case in which the legs are locked up to the knees . and an iron wedge then driven in until sometimes the bones were crushed and the marrow spouted out . pin sticking , drowning , starving . the rack , were too common to need details , sometimes the prisoner was hung up by the thumbs . and whipped by one person , while another held lighted candles to the feet and other parts of the body .
he began to look on simeon as an overrated amateur . sleep refused to come to him , it got as far as his feet . but no farther , he rose and stamped to restore the circulation . it was at this point that he definitely condemned simeon stylites as a sybaritic fraud . if this were one of those realistic zolaesque stories i would describe the crick in the back that .
we were as patient as possible with terry , he had lived about nine months among the `` colonels '' when he made that outburst . and with no chance at any more strenuous excitement than our gymnastics gave us . save for our escape fiasco , i do not suppose terry had ever lived so long with neither love . combat , nor danger to employ his superabundant energies . and he was irritable , neither jeff nor i found it so wearing , i was so much interested intellectually that our confinement did not wear on me .
he felt in his waistcoat pocket . found a dime , put it back again , and bent forward and patted master abrahams on the head . there is in certain men -- and bruce carmyle was one of them . a quality of resilience , a sturdy refusal to acknowledge defeat . which aids them as effectively in affairs of the heart as in encounters of a sterner and more practical kind .
martyrdom made a saint of [female] queen of scots three hundred years ago . and she has hardly lost all of her saintship yet , martyrdom made a saint of the trivial and foolish [female] antoinette . and her biographers still keep her fragrant with the odor of sanctity to this day . while unconsciously proving upon almost every page they write that the only calamitous instinct which her husband lacked . she supplied -- the instinct to root out and get rid of an honest .
from van boy to a small greengrocer , he had risen to the important position of calling on customers to solicit orders . and here he had shown his first flash of genius . he had cultivated every housewife and maid servant assiduously , never allowing them to buy anything he could not recommend . when eventually he started in business on his own account . he had carefully canvassed his late employer 's customers .
the bird stretched its wings , shook the ash from its tail . and began to preen itself , every movement was like the flash of a silent explosion . the bird started , turned toward him , looked at him for an instant with wild . fearless eyes , then continued its preening , suddenly it stopped and cocked its head as if listening to something . then david heard it too : a shout down the mountainside .
and so it came about that [male] , enjoying himself one night . after the manner of his kind , was suddenly dropped upon with violence . he had constructed an ingenious machine , consisting of a biscuit tin . some pebbles , and some string , he put the pebbles in the tin . tied the string to it , and placed it under a chest of drawers .
why is he insane ? i told you before : it is because his opinions are not ours . i know of no other reason , and i do not need any other . it is the only way we have of discovering insanity when it is not violent . it is merely the picturesqueness of his insanity that makes it more interesting than my kind or yours . for instance , consider his little book ' -- the one described in the previous article .
if i were going to build a house with my wife . i should not choose a season of the year when the bricks and planks and things were liable to be torn out of her hand . her skirts blown over her head . and she left clinging for dear life to a scaffolding pole . i know the feminine biped and .
instead , therefore , of the jubilant letter i had intended to send her . i wrote one of quite a different tone , i mentioned the arduous nature of my work . i referred to the struggle in which i was engaged , i indicated cleverly that i was a man of extraordinary courage battling with fate . i implied that i made just enough to live on , it would have been cruel to arouse expectations which might never be fulfilled . in this letter , accordingly , and in subsequent letters , i rather went to the opposite extreme .
two weeks before , mr. [female] had looked on jill with favour . she had seemed good in his eyes , but that refusal of hers to lunch with him . followed by a refusal some days later to take a bit of supper somewhere . had altered his views on feminine charm , if it had been left to him . as most things were about this theatre , to decide which of the thirteen girls should be dismissed .
up to 1872 but one of these orders was represented in this general conference , this general conference was strictly a clerical organization . but in 1872 we marked a new epoch in methodist history . and a new element came into this body , and has been in all our sessions since that date . the first step , as has been mentioned here before , was taken in 1868 . when the question of lay delegation was sent down to the members of the church over twenty one years of age .
this is but an instance ; she showed me many . the big difference was that whereas our children grow up in private homes and families . with every effort made to protect and seclude them from a dangerous world . here they grew up in a wide , friendly world , and knew it for theirs . from the first , their child literature was a wonderful thing , i could have spent years following the delicate subtleties .
[female] , the photographer , also related that he had listened to a sermon in the city . and that if anyone would guarantee him a sermon like that he would defy you to keep him away from church . meanwhile , failing the guarantee , he stayed away . the very doctrines were impeached , some of the congregation began to cast doubts on eternal punishment . doubts so grave as to keep them absent from the lenten services of sorrow .
the next day their mother treated the twins as if they were not . she spoke no word to them and did not seem to hear their husky little efforts at reconciliation . they found it hard to remember persistently that they were revolutionists rather than children in disgrace . she was unapproachable in her own room when mr. [male] and mr. [male] came for them . `` well , we can not help it , '' they said sadly as they locked their two trunks and went down the stairs .
she made a sort of chart . superimposing the different religions as i described them . with a pin run through them all , as it were . their common basis being a dominant power or powers . and some special behavior , mostly taboos , to please or placate , there were some common features in certain groups of religions .
he would most unquestionably get a flogging for it ! he fetched a large pewter ink pot . and tried nervously to blacken the letters with the tip of a quill . to make them , if possible , rather less obtrusive than they were , all in vain . they only stood out with more startling vividness when picked out in black upon the brown stained deal .
the south [location] lady had located her mysterious self in a fragrant spot . the corner of bowery and broome street and vicinity seems to have some kind of a constitutional disorder . and it relieves itself by a cutaneous eruption of low rum shops and pustulous beer saloons . which always look as if they ought to be squeezed and rubbed with ointment of red lead . to an observing person it appears as if the city wanted to scratch itself in that particular part to relieve the local irritation .
the `` manifestations '' exhibited by her purport to be produced by [female] . the hebrew champion and anti philistine . in preparing for her exhibition , she has a table placed sideways against the wall of the room . and covered with a thick blanket that reaches to the floor . a large tin dishpan , with handles a german accordeon .
one sunday afternoon in every three months the rector and several ladies went down and sang hymns for him in his mission house . but his work was really very easy , a funeral , for example , at the mission . was a simple affair , meaning nothing more than the preparation of a plain coffin and a glassless hearse and the distribution of a few artificial everlasting flowers to women crying in their aprons . a thing easily done : whereas inasaph 's parish . where all the really important souls were , a funeral was a large event .
there is a harmless contrivance for building up the female hair called , i am told , a pad . it can be made of combings , and then , of course . is literally the girl 's own hair , he came upon [male] at the moment when . retracing her steps and with her back towards him . she was looking for it , with his usual luck .
those who wished to furnish reasons to totter on their thrones for [organization] at so much per tot . could do so ; he , for one , did not propose to farm out his immortal soul and plug hat to the party . if sixty million people had to stand four years under the administration of a setting hen . spring is now here , it has been here before , but not so much so . perhaps , as it is this year , in spring the buds swell up and bust .
he traced that gallant sorter to a still suburban square . he watched his opportunity , and seized him unaware . he took a life preserver and he hit him on the head . and mrs. [female] dissected him before she went to bed . and pretty little alice grew more settled in her mind , she never more was guilty of a weakness of the kind .
so we have risen together , you to a point from which you may be easily observed and flayed alive by the newspapers . while i am the same pleasant , unassuming , gentlemanly friend of the poor that i was when only a justice of the peace and comparatively unknown . mr. president , i hope you will not feel that i have been too forward in writing to you personally over my own name . i mean to do what is best for you , you can truly say that all i have ever done in this way has been for your good . i speak in a plain way sometimes , but i do not beat about the [male] .
this was intended to be scornful , merton meant that on the screen it would be recognized as this and nothing more . it could not be taken for the mansion of a rich banker . or the country home of a wall street magnate . he felt that he had been keen in his dispraise . especially as old gashwiler would never get the sting of it , clod !
no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma . the room at the crown was to witness it . but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd . mr. [male] had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves . for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came .
`` is the good old man in it ? '' if so , that would decide us . when the good old man is a trustee for any one he can battle against adversity much longer . he is a plucky old fellow , and while that trust money lasts he keeps a brave heart and fights on boldly . it is not until he has spent the last penny of it that he gives way . it then flashes across the old man 's mind that his motives for having lived in luxury upon that trust money for years may possibly be misunderstood .
`` and was the prince of wales there ? '' asked diva . beginning to wind her head up again , she did not care about the crowds . `` oh , mamma , may i stand by you , or behind you ? '' asked [female] , completely dazzled by the splendour of this prospect and prancing about the lawn ... this was quite awful : it was as bad as , if not worse than .
the manner in which the youth expressed himself . the fact that he was from their own neighbourhood . and above all , the letter of recommendation he carried in his face . inspired the brother and sister with a desire to befriend him as much as they could . after they had distributed some money among such of the rest as seemed in most need of it .
there was an old man , who when little fell casually into a kettle ; but , growing too stout . he could never get out , so he passed all his life in that kettle . there was an old person of [location] , who tried to teach fishes to walk . when they tumbled down dead , he grew weary , and said , `` i had better go back to [location] ! '' there was an old person of shoreham , whose habits were marked by decorum .
there were no adventures because there was nothing to fight , there were no wild beasts in the country and very few tame ones . of these i might as well stop to describe the one common pet of the country . cats , of course , but such cats ! what do you suppose these lady burbanks had done with their cats ? by the most prolonged and careful selection and exclusion they had developed a race of cats that did not sing !
i had just learned how to reel around a ballroom to a little waltz music . when i was blown across the state of [location] in september last by a high wind . and broke one of my legs which i use in waltzing , when this accident occurred i had just got where i felt at liberty to choose a glorious being with starry eyes and fluffy hair . and magnificently modeled form , to steer me around the rink to the dreamy music of strauss . one young lady , with whom i had waltzed a good deal .
but already the call of duty was sounding in my ears . and these english , in spite of all the fraternity which exists among sportsmen . would certainly have made me prisoner , there was no hope for my mission now . and i had done all that i could do , i could see the lines of massena 's camp no very great distance off . for , by a lucky chance , the chase had taken [location] in that direction .
president [location] did not have to escape from the capital to avoid office seekers . he could get on a horse at his door and in five minutes be out of sight . he could remain in the forest back of his house until martha blew the horn signifying that the man who wanted the post office at pigback had gone . and then he could return , how times have changed with the growth of the republic ! now pigback has grown so that the name has been changed to hogback , and the president avails himself of every funeral that he can possibly feel an interest in .
the whole sistem is based on the sue , mable , as near as i can make out a sue aint worth anything . a hundred sues make a centimeter an a hundred centimeters make a [male] . five franks make a dollar only now they dont . that gives you an idear how simple it is to go into a store an figger what you can buy with a quarter . i hear the battery comin back so i guess ill quit this and fall in on the tail of the colyum .
the consul duilius was entering rome in triumph after his celebrated defeat of the carthaginian fleet at myla . he had won a great naval victory for his country with the first fleet that it had ever possessed . which was naturally a gratifying reflection , and he would have been perfectly happy now . if he had only been a little more comfortable , then the large delphic wreath . which duilius wore as well as the crown , had slipped down over one eye and was tickling his nose .
again there was that kind of rummy something in his manner . it was the way he said it . do not you know , he did not like the suit . i pulled myself together to assert myself . something seemed to tell me that , unless i was jolly careful and nipped this lad in the bud .
i had been looking down all the time , feeling mighty proud and scared . but at that i could not help glancing up to see the other boys admire me . but the first person my eye lit on was your grandma . standing in the back of the room , where she had stopped for a moment on her way up to church . and glaring at me in a mighty unpleasant way .
the inner walls of the church were placarded with large mural tablets of copper . bearing engraved inscriptions celebrating the merits of old heilbronn worthies of two or three centuries ago . and also bearing rudely painted effigies of themselves and their families tricked out in the queer costumes of those days . the head of the family sat in the foreground . and beyond him extended a sharply receding and diminishing row of sons .
equal april 19 , patriot 's day . equal a new england successor to fast day . the slowest day of the year , originally invented for fasting and prayer . now used exclusively for opening the baseball season , locating a seashore home for the summer . and watching red shirted diogenes at his tub , little drops of water .
the most remarkable of all these conversions was that of the celebrated engraver , [male] , who . notwithstanding his eminent position as an artist , by no means bore out his name in other things . he had previously become thoroughly imbued with the notions of swedenborg . mesmer , and the famous [male] brothers . and was quite ripe for anything fantastic , such a convert was a perfect godsend to [female] .
he painstakingly examined the fingers , observing their form . proportions , and natural manner of disposing themselves when in repose . all this process was watched by the three spectators with absorbing interest . their heads bent together over luigi 's palm . and nobody disturbing the stillness with a word .
then there was this infernal detective , [male] had told his wife he was going to davos to see carter . to that he had fancied she was reconciled , but how she would take this exploit was entirely problematical . she was a woman of peculiar moral views . and she measured marital infidelity largely by its proximity to herself . out of her sight , and more particularly out of the sight of the other women of her set .
today he was giving his monthly tea in honour of the new number . only contributors were invited , and the menu was always of the best , it was a punch dinner . only more so , for these teas were celebrated with musical honours , and charteris on the banjo was worth hearing . his rendering of extracts from the works of messrs [male] and [male] was an intellectual treat . `` when i take the chair at our harmonic club ! ''
no rational man would grudge it if it could be presented in a bill as a lump sum at breakfast time every morning and done with for the day . but the incessant necessity of handing out small tips of graded amounts gets on one 's nerves . it is necessary in [location] to go round with enough money of different denominations in one 's pocket to start a bank . gold and paper notes for serious purchases . and with them a huge dead weight of great silver pieces .
the whole lobule was looking first rate , you might ride for a week and not run across a prettier lobule or a more artistic aggregation of cell nests outside a penitentiary . only one cell nest had been allowed to dry up on the way . and this looked a good deal fatigued , in one specimen i noticed a carneous degeneration . but this is really no reflection on mr. [male] personally . while he has been ill it is not surprising that he should allow his cell nests to carneously degenerate .
the last word was uttered in a tone that caused [male] to wrench his eyes away from the dancers as if he had been caught in the act of some impropriety . `` yes , m'lady , '' and he reluctantly left the scene of festivity . full of envy and self pity , as [male] round one side of the canvas screen . dr. little bustled round the other , he had been detained by an important patient who lived ten miles away . when his eyes beheld the scene before him .
take all his people out for a walk , he trembled at the idea . he would have to pass through the court with them . under the eyes of the men who were loitering about the grass plots before going down to the boats . through the open window he could hear their voices . and the clash they made as they fenced with walking sticks .
likewise beware of the alleged [location] cocktail occasionally dispensed . with an air of pride and accomplished triumph . by the british barmaid of an [location] bar . if for purposes of experiment and research you feel that you must take one . order with it , instead of the customary olive or cherry .
it was at the moment when life seemed at its best that shadows gathered . [male] [location] had never accepted his son in law 's playful invitation to `` bring his bag and stay overnight , '' and now the time for it was past , in the spring his health gave way . mrs. clemens , who adored him . went to elmira to be at his bedside , three months of lingering illness brought the end .
[female] had been lying in the hammock on the porch when her brother 's yell had broken forth . it was a lovely , calm , moonlight night . and she had been revelling in the peace of it . when suddenly this outcry from above had shot her out of her hammock like an explosion . she ran upstairs , fearing she knew not what .
cables from [location] , chancellor now positive as to torpid . sworn evidence that she was sunk by some one throwing a rock . sample of rock to follow , communication also from [location] regarding the new cases . draws attention to fact that all of the crews who were not drowned were saved . an important point , assures this government that everything ascertainable will be ascertained .
then , replied the idiot , unabashed , it is time you returned it . do not you think men 's morals are rather lax in this matter of umbrellas , mr , [male] ? he added , turning from the school master , who began to show signs of irritation . `` very , '' said the minister , running his finger about his neck to make the collar which had been sent home from the laundry by mistake set more easily -- ', very lax . at the last conference i attended , some person .
[female] , she cried as the door opened and a man entered . he advanced gladly to meet her , and in a moment mother and son were folded in a close embrace . it was [male] , the man from sing sing . true to his word , he had slipped away unostentatiously at the height of the festivities . `` alas , [male] , '' said the mother after the warmth of the first greetings had passed .
before the big man had time to splutter his protests . she had swung round the mop and brought the handle down with a crack upon his bare , [female] . then , once more swinging round to the business end of the mop . she drew back a step and charged , the mop got the big man just beneath the chin . for a moment he stood on one leg .
yet surely you might have gratified my ambition , from this single confidence . that i shall always prefer the indulgence of your inclinations to the satisfaction of my own . a very strong instance of which i shall give you in this address . in which i am determined to follow the example of all other dedicators , and will consider not what my patron really deserves to have written . but what he will be best pleased to read , without further preface then , i here present you with the labours of some years of my life .
baedeker , [female] , one of the most versatile men who ever lived . childhood and old age unknown , formed an ambition to travel when quite young . first visited switzerland , where he climbed every peak . walked every path , hired every guide , and did everything a tourist should so . his field of travel widened until every country in [location] was visited .
this is exquisite , and you really cared not a rap about it all the time , but now ? now that we have made it so homelike for you ? uh -- the rooms all seem to smell of lavender and dried rose leaves. . but perhaps it 's aunt [female] that has brought that scent with her . why should not you , too , find some sort of vocation in life , mrs. hedda ?
mr. [male] stared , as well he might . but making nothing of it , and being chiefly anxious not to be interrupted any longer . only said , `` oh , well , do not bother me ; i daresay it 's all right , cut along ! '' so mr. [male] was free ; the path lay open to him now . he knew he would have little difficulty in finding his way to the station .
when he found , therefore , that nightingale was perfectly acquainted with his intrigue . and began to suspect that so scrupulous a delicacy as he had hitherto observed was not quite necessary on the occasion . he gave a latitude to his friend 's tongue . and desired him to speak plainly what he knew , or had ever heard of the lady . nightingale , who , in many other instances , was rather too effeminate in his disposition .
in spite of their ride , the indefatigable sisters were up early next morning . and the first thing georgie saw out of his bathroom window was the pair of them practising lifting shots over the ducking pond on the green till breakfast was ready . he had given a short account of last night 's adventure to foljambe when she called him . omitting the episode about his hair , and her disapproval was strongly indicated by her silence then . and the studied contempt of her manner to the sisters when they came in to breakfast .
the climax scene of the play exhibited the wife with a bundle of rods . surrounded by ragged children , driving out into a midnight storm the husband of her bosom . while peals of thunder and flashes of lightning brought goose pimples and shivers to the frightened audience . the impression made upon the mind of [female] and myself did not give [location] a very hopeful view of married life . and while the haphazard working , drinking habits of the husband seemed to deserve all the punishment he received .
then on the afternoon of a day that promised to end as other days had ended . a wave of animation swept through the waiting room and the casting office . `` swell cabaret stuff '' was the phrase that brought the applicants to a lively swarm about the little window . evening clothes , glad wraps . cigarette cases , vanity boxes -- the victor people doing the blight of broadway with muriel mercer .
calvete complied , and teodoro threw the cloak over his shoulders . asking him in [male] rafael 's presence to what part of the country he belonged . whence he was coming , and whither he was going . the youth replied that he was from [location] . and he named as his birthplace a town which was but two leagues distant from that of the brother and sister .
we might have made the summit before night . but for a delay caused by the loss of an umbrella . i was allowing the umbrella to remain lost , but the men murmured . and with reason , for in this exposed region we stood in peculiar need of protection against avalanches . so i went into camp and detached a strong party to go after the missing article .
a girl in blue had risen from the nearest table . and was staring at her in astonishment , jill recognized her instantly . those big , pathetic eyes , like a lost child 's , were unmistakable , it was the parrot girl . the girl whom she and freddie rooke had found in the drawing room . at ovington square that afternoon when the foundations of the world had given way and chaos had begun .
we went tearing along in a most exhilarating way , and i performed the delicate duties of my office very well indeed for a first attempt . but perceiving , presently , that i really was going to shoot the bridge itself instead of the archway under it . i judiciously stepped ashore , the next moment i had my long coveted desire . i saw a raft wrecked , it hit the pier in the center and went all to smash and scatteration like a box of matches struck by lightning . i was the only one of our party who saw this grand sight .
and now , without any further preface , we proceed to our next chapter . a short hint of what we can do in the sublime . and a description of miss sophia western , so charming may she now appear ! and you the feathered choristers of nature . whose sweetest notes not even handel can excell , tune your melodious throats to celebrate her appearance .
so he kept the gold pieces tied up in his handkerchief and took his ten dollar to a hardware store . where he bought what the phoenix wanted -- a coil of rope . an electric door bell , a pushbutton . and one hundred feet of insulated wire , then he brought the package home . hid it behind the woodpile in the garage .
this was going to be a close thing , and success or failure a matter of minutes . if he followed my instructions smith would be starting for the continental boat train tonight with his companion . and , working out the distances , i saw that , by the time i could arrive . he might already have left my rooms , [male] 's supervision at sanstead station had made it impossible for me to send a telegram . i had had to trust to chance , fortunately my train .
that episode had rather discouraged his passion for realism . and fire drill since then had taken the form . for the most part , of `` practising escaping. '' this was done by means of canvas shoots . kept in the dormitories , at the sound of the bell the prefect of the dormitory would heave one end of the shoot out of window . the other end being fastened to the sill , he would then go down it himself .
at this point it occurred to him that it would be judicious to find out when his race was to start . it was rather a chilly day , and the less time he spent in the undress uniform of shorts the better . he bought a correct card for twopence . and scanned it , the strangers mile was down for four fifty . there was no need to change for an hour yet , he wished the authorities could have managed to date the event earlier .
but it is not necessary to enlarge on his abilities , the figures against his name in wisden prove a good deal . the fact that he had steered [male] 's through into the last round of the house matches proves still more . it was perfectly obvious to everyone that , if only you could get fenn out for under ten . [male] 's total for that innings would be nearer twenty than forty . they were an appalling side , but then no house bowler had as yet succeeded in getting fenn out for under ten .
97 , a prince laughing at one of his courtiers whom he had employed in several embassies . told him , he looked like an owl . i know not , answered the courtier , what i look like ; but this i know . that i have had the honour several times to represent your majesty 's person , 104 . cato the censor being ask would , how it came to pass .
so , perhaps the world is wise in promising [location] the circus . we believe her at first , but after a while , i fear , we grow discouraged . picture frames you fashioned out of gingerbeer corks . you saved your ginger beer corks . you found a picture -- and the thing was complete .
`` why , you skulking little devil , you , '' they would say , `` get up and do something for your living , can ', t you ? '' —not knowing , of course , that i was ill . and they didn t give me pills . they gave me clumps on the side of the head .
nothing but my cool behavior at this critical time saved [location] from another panic . i ordered them to show me the place . they led me to a spot where a huge boulder lay in a deep pool of clear and brilliant water . it did look like a pretty bad leak , but i kept that to myself . i made a pump and set the men to work to pump out the glacier .
oh , but it 's an awful thing to be haunted by a technical bogy , ern . you wo not be haunted much longer , the law must be on its last legs . and in a few hours i shall come to life again -- resume all my social and civil functions . and claim my darling as my blushing bride , [male] . oh -- then you have not heard ? ern , my love , i have heard nothing .
this hen does not win the general confidence , shunned by good society during life . her death is only regretted by those who are called upon to assist at her obsequies . selfish through life , her death is regarded as a calamity by those alone who are expected to eat her . and what has such a hen to look back upon in her closing hours ? a long life , perhaps , for longevity is one of the characteristics of this class of hens .
it was four o'clock by the time [female] and [female] went to the wickets for the second time . their side had been headed by their opponents by a dozen on the first innings . 68 to 56 , a splendid spirit of confidence animated the two batsmen . the umpire who had effected [male] 's downfall in the first innings had since received a hard drive in the small of the back as he turned coyly away to avoid the ball . and was now being massaged by strong men in the taproom of the village inn .
patty looked about desperately , the lecture room was shaped like an amphitheater , with part of the seats on a level with the main floor . and the rest rising in tiers , patty sat on the main floor . well toward the rear , she could barely see the professor 's head . but he was coming irrevocably , she did not have to see very clearly to know that . the girl before her answered wildly ; the professor frowned , and , looking down at his roll book .
well , i boomed along another hundred and fifty million miles , and got up abreast his shoulder . as you may say , i was feeling pretty fine , i tell you . but just then i noticed the officer of the deck come to the side and hoist his glass in my direction . straight off i heard him sing out -- below there , ahoy , shake her up . shake her up , heave on a hundred million billion tons of brimstone !
you see , he had his hull strength . the young chap did ; for his sister had clothed him . as well as boarded him , and educated him : so he could talk powerful . he could use up quantities of wind . and not miss it , havin all his strength .
`` searcher , '' [location] , [location] -- cum [female] was the motto of the ancients . and was written in blue letters at the base of the shield on a field emerald . supported by a cucumber recumbent , the author is unknown , that depends on what you call a good living . [male] if your stomach would not revolt at plain fare . such as poor people use , come up and stop at our house awhile .
in a couple of days [male] was up to his head and ears in theatrical composition and stage structure . a few years before the bard had `` dashed off '' a love tragedy entitled `` romeo and juliet , '' taken from an italian novel of the thirteenth century , and a translation of the old family feud in poetry . by [male] , who had but recently delighted [location] with the story . the exemplification of true love , as pictured in the pure affection of juliet and the intense .
i said a big war would stop the exhibit of most every country . it has stopped [location] -- she do not have much show here to the fair . they wanted to , and laid out to , but could not on account of havin to go to war , it is dretful busy this year , [female] off men , and sendin out men all the time to be killed .
he began that morning with some memories of the comstock mine . then he dropped back to his childhood , closing at last with some comment on matters quite recent . how delightful it was -- his [male] , unhurried fashion of speech . the unconscious habits of his delicate hands , the play of his features as his fancies and phrases passed through his mind and were accepted or put aside . we were watching one of the great literary creators of his time in the very process of his architecture .
while they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage . it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in . he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted . and her tongue motionless , they were combined only of anger against herself . mortification , and deep concern , she had not been able to speak .
i have already informed you of one trip i made to the moon . in search of my silver hatchet . i afterwards made another in a much pleasanter manner . and stayed in it long enough to take notice of several things . which i will endeavour to describe as accurately as my memory will permit , i went on a voyage of discovery at the request of a distant relation .
the marchioness was not disturbed , but lord [male] again went up to [location] . on this occasion occupying the house in [male] court in solitude . his scruples were all renewed , and it was in vain that lady [male] repeated to him all mr. [male] 's arguments . he had been called a mean fellow . and the word rankled with him , he walked about alone thinking of the absolute obedience with which in early days he had complied with all the behests of his elder brother .
colbert was commanded to set out for sedan , with positive orders to carry the letter to mazarin . and bring it back to letellier , he listened to his orders with scrupulous attention . required the instructions to be repeated twice , and was particular in learning whether the bringing back was as necessary as the communicating . and letellier replied sternly , `` more necessary , '' then he set out , traveled like a courier . without any care for his body , and placed in the hands of mazarin .
his eldest daughter 's alarm was equal to his own , the horror of being blocked up at randalls . while her children were at hartfield , was full in her imagination . and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay . she was eager to have it settled , that her father and emma should remain at randalls . while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .
we could not have added anything to that party . when it came our turn to answer the questions in the adverb game it would be just our luck to have the chosen word `` gracefully '' or `` seductively '' or something like that . and probably the burlesque was no good anyhow unless one could get into the spirit of the thing . that is our traditional failure , right at the beginning of a party we realize that it is our duty to get gay and put ice down people 's backs and all that . and it terrifies us , whenever a host says `` here , drink some more scotch and liven up ''
it was a gentle , harmless , old ghost . too , and we all felt very sorry for it , and pitied it . the women folk , indeed , made quite a pet of it . for a while , its faithfulness touched them so . but as time went on , it grew to be a bit a bore .
at the sight of him mr. [male] . according to his previous determination , resolved to dismount , he tightened the brake . and the machine stopped dead , he was trying to think what he did with his right leg whilst getting off . he gripped the handles and released the brake . standing on the left pedal and waving his right foot in the air .
it was true that in what might be called the return match she had utterly routed kirk . but until this moment she had always been aware of him as an opponent who might have to be reckoned with . she was quite convinced that it would be in the best interests of everybody . especially of [male] , if he could be eliminated , there were signs of human weakness in ruth which sometimes made her uneasy . ruth , she told herself .
the problem now was what to do with the painted shoe , it would take a lot of cleaning . he saw , even if he could get hold of the necessary implements for cleaning it . and he rather doubted if he would be able to do so , edmund , the boot boy . worked in some mysterious cell far from the madding crowd . at the back of the house , in the boot cupboard downstairs there would probably be nothing likely to be of any use .
but it is for this especial reason that such an explanation is necessary on the very threshold of the definition of ideals . for owing to that historic fallacy with which i have just dealt , numbers of readers will expect me . when i propound an ideal , to propound a new ideal . now i have no notion at all of propounding a new ideal , there is no new ideal imaginable by the madness of modern sophists . which will be anything like so startling as fulfilling any one of the old ones .
no , but poor [female] swears to this day it were better it had been . if it could only have been broken the right way and on the right field . for that evening we heard that everything had gone wrong in the surprise . there we had been waiting for one of those early fogs , and at last the fog had come . and jubal early had , that morning , pushed out every man he had .
but it was no use putting it off any longer . he resolved at last to go in and get it over , and opened the door accordingly . how warm and comfortable the room looked -- more comfortable than it had ever seemed to him before . even on the first day of the holidays , and his father would be sitting there in a quarter of an hour 's time . just as he was now , while he himself would be lumbering along to the station through the dismal raw fog !
the little girl did not mind being alone , for she was working on her first piece of embroidery . a sofa pillow for papa 's birthday present . so she crept into the big bay window and curled herself up on the broad sill while she bent her brown head over her work . he was short and fat , and seemed to be breathing heavily from his climb up the stairs . he held a work silk hat in one hand and underneath his other elbow was tucked a good-sized book .
in a glass case behind the inner door . reading a newspaper and chewing gum , sat a dignified old man in the rich uniform of a general in the guatemalan army . he was a brilliant spectacle , he wore no jewelry . but this , no doubt , was due to a private distaste for display . as there was no one else of humbler rank at hand from whom jill could solicit an introduction and the privilege of an audience .
but plainly he was aware that something more interesting was happening at their table than at any of the other tables . and he was watching with a bovine inquisitiveness which affected jill with a sense of outrage . a moment before , she had resented the indifference of the outer world . now , this one staring man seemed like a watching multitude , there were tears in her eyes . and she felt that the red-faced man suspected it .
first and last , a good many men have gone gunning for me . but they have always planned the obsequies before they caught the deceased . i reckon there has not been a time in twenty years when there was not a nice `` gates ajar '' piece all made up and ready for me in some office near the board of trade . but the first essential of a quiet funeral is a willing corpse .
it was kind of lazy and jolly . laying off comfortable all day , smoking and fishing . and no books nor study , two months or more run along . and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt . and i did not see how i would ever got to like it so well at the widow 's .
he simply waits for them to dry up -- and then he goes out and does as he pleases . never doubt his word -- even when you know he is lying . a husband is like religion : to give you any real comfort . he must be taken with blind faith , never put him on a leash . the dog or the husband that has to be tied is always the one that eventually has to be advertised in the `` lost '' columns .
the princess sabloukoff was not , however , one of those who can live upon the interest of a bygone fame . she saw that , when the time of coquetry and its fascinations has passed . still , with faculties like hers , there was yet a great game to be played . hitherto she had only studied characters ; now she began to reflect upon events . the transition was an easy one , to which her former knowledge contributed largely its assistance .
i was extremely diverted last ball night to see the master of the ceremonies leading . with great solemnity , to the upper end of the room . an antiquated [female] , dressed in her lady 's cast clothes . whom he mistook for some countess just arrived at the bath . the ball was opened by a scotch lord .
`` i do , sir , '' said [male] , and turned to look out over the chimney pots of the city . biting his under lip very tight , since then he has applied at countless places for work . but always they have written to his old employer , mr. [male] . for a reference , and have received a letter similar to the one given here as an example . naturally , they have not felt like taking him on , you can not blame them .
of all of which he partook but sparingly , while munching a piece of bread . and scattering tobacco ash with complete insouciance . two hours did he sit over this meal . then poured himself out another cup of the rapidly cooling tea . and walked to the window , this faced the courtyard , and outside it .
parliament was adjourned for a week -- to let the members cool off . perhaps -- a sacrifice of precious time ; for but two months remained in which to carry the all important ausgleich to a consummation . if i have reported the behaviour of the house intelligibly . the reader has been surprised by it , and has wondered whence these law makers come and what they are made of . and he has probably supposed that the conduct exhibited at the long sitting was far out of the common .
loaysa listened with great inward glee to this conversation . which showed how readily the women were taking the very bent he would have given them . the negro was afraid lest his master should return and catch him talking with them . but they would not go away until he had promised that , when they least expected it . he would call them to hear a capital voice .
the firmness and constancy of a true friend is a circumstance so extremely delightful to persons in any kind of distress . that the distress itself , if it be only temporary . and admits of relief , is more than compensated by bringing this comfort with it . nor are instances of this kind so rare as some superficial and inaccurate observers have reported . to say the truth , want of compassion is not to be numbered among our general faults .
my eyes wander round the carriage and rest on my bag . have i put everything in ? of course i have . then why this uneasy feeling that i have left something very important out ? well , i can soon settle the question , let 's start with to night . evening clothes -- they are in , i know .
she went out and i returned to my sofa , after an hour or so my mind began to get to work . and i got up and walked slowly up and down the room , the gentle exercise seemed to stimulate me . seeing my new putter in the corner of the room . i took it up and , dropping a golf ball on the carpet . began to practise , after five or ten minutes , my ideas being now quite clear .
from that moment mr. [male] brought to the collecting of scarabs the same furious energy which had given him so many dollar and so much indigestion . he went after scarabs like a dog after rats . he scooped in scarabs from the four corners of the earth . until at the end of a year he found himself possessed of what . purely as regarded quantity , was a record collection .
`` the king , by his silence , still stands to the terms . '' then i lifted up my hands -- stood just so a moment . then i said , with the most awful solemnity : `` let the enchantment dissolve and pass harmless away ! '' there was no response , for a moment , in that deep darkness and that graveyard hush . but when the silver rim of the sun pushed itself out .
doctor [female] -- to whom i referred in connection with my exposition of the davenport imposture . produces very loud `` raps '' before his audiences , and so modulates them that they will seem to be at any desired point in his vicinity . yet not a movement of his body betrays the fact that the sounds are caused by him . the fox family found that the rapping business would be made to pay . and so they continued it , with varying success .
like most pugilists he had a passion for bursting into print . print is the fighter 's accolade . it signifies that he has arrived , he was grateful to smith . too , for not editing his contributions , [male] groaned under the supervision of a member of the staff of his sunday paper . who deleted his best passages and altered the rest into addisonian english .
there was another puzzled man , too -- the rev , mr. [male] . for days , wherever he went . people seemed to follow him or to be watching out for him . and if he ever found himself in a retired spot . a member of the nineteen would be sure to appear , thrust an envelope privately into his hand .
it was so amusing , that [male] , with ruth upon his arm . stood looking down from the wharf , as nearly regardless as it was in the nature of flesh and blood to be . of an elderly lady behind him , who had brought a large umbrella with her . and did not know what to do with it , this tremendous instrument had a hooked handle . and its vicinity was first made known to him by a painful pressure on the windpipe .
he puzzled and interested me so much that i did my best to enter into conversation with him . only to be baffled by the jerky embarrassment with which he met all advances . and when we got out at esher , curiosity led me to keep him still in view . evidently he had not come with any intention of making money . he avoided the grand stand , with the bookmakers huddling in couples .
this is the arresting and dominant fact about modern social discussion . that the quarrel is not merely about the difficulties , but about the aim . we agree about the evil ; it is about the good that we should tear each other 's eyes out . we all admit that a lazy aristocracy is a bad thing . we should not by any means all admit that an active aristocracy would be a good thing .
next he blamed himself , if he had only resisted that creek like a man he would not have been a hundred miles from home without clothes or money . and silly about a girl he had never seen until that day . then he blamed the girl , why , why was she such a confiding and altogether artless and bewitching little fool ? she was not , he remembered her eyes and abjectly apologized to the memory of her . she was everything that was sweet and pure and womanly .
seeing a young creature before me in a white dress . with white satin shoes ; with a pink ribbon . about a yard in breadth , flaming out as she twirled in a polka in the arms of monsieur [female] springbock . the german diplomatist ; with a green wreath on her head . and the blackest hair this individual set eyes on .
life became like what the poet [male] says . one grand , sweet song , things went on so comfortably and peacefully for a couple of weeks that i give you my word that i would almost forgotten such a person as motty existed . the only flaw in the scheme of things was that [male] was still pained and distant . it was not anything he said or did . mind you , but there was a rummy something about him all the time .
for poor [female] , in this matter , naturally lacked composure . especially when she meditated upon some of [male] 's intimations . it was not cheerful work , at the best , to keep giving small hammer taps to the coffin in which one had laid away . for burial , the poor little unacknowledged offspring of one 's own misbehaving heart . and the occupation was not rendered more agreeable by the fact that the ghost of one 's stifled dream had been summoned from the shades by the strange .
oh , the serene expression on the face of charity . which seemed to say , i know that all my family have injured me beyond the possibility of reparation . but i forgive them , for it is my duty so to do ! and , oh , the gay simplicity of mercy ; so charming . innocent , and infant like , that if she had gone out walking by herself .
the speaker unclasped his arms and stood with head bowed . his face working curiously , striving to hold back the sobs , for merton gill was once more [male] armytage . popular idol of the screen , in his great role of buck benson bidding the accustomed farewell to his four footed pal that had brought him safely through countless dangers . how are we to know that in another couple of hundred feet of the reel buck will escape the officers of the law who have him for that hold up of the wallahoola stage . of which he was innocent -- leap from a second story window of the sheriff 's office onto the back of his old pal .
at the same time , i am desirous of adding a few words as to the history of the two previously published volumes . and more particularly of the first or original `` book of nonsense , '' relating to which many absurd reports have crept into circulation . such as that it was the composition of the late lord brougham . the late earl of derby , etc , ; that the rhymes and pictures are by different persons . or that the whole have a symbolical meaning , etc , ; whereas , every one of the rhymes was composed by myself .
we had also in our drawer a book of [location] witticisms . published in [location] , to cut one out , preface it with `` a good [location] story comes to hand , '' and pin it on a slip was a pleasing variation of the usual mode of constructing a paragraph . gresham and i each had our favourite method , personally , i had always a partiality for dealing with `` buffers . '' `` the brakes refused to act , and the train struck the buffers at the end of the platform ''
but here i turn to an art i know more about , that of journalism . only in my ease the art verges on artlessness . it is needless to say that this respecting of persons has led all the other parties a dance of degradation . we ruin [location] because it would be a slight on lord gladstone to save [location] . we have a bad army , because it would be a snub to lord haldane to have a good army .
the [male] likewise very wisely preferred the more solid enjoyments he expected with this lady . to the fleeting charms of person . he was one of those wise men who regard beauty in the other sex as a very worthless and superficial qualification . or , to speak more truly , who rather chuse to possess every convenience of life with an ugly woman . than a handsome one without any of those conveniences , and having a very good appetite .
so the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort . and before long the duke tackled his bottle ; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again . and the tighter they got the lovinger they got . and went off a snoring in each other 's arms , they both got powerful mellow . but i noticed the king did not get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money bag again .
can you beat it ? his features stained with a greenish hue ! now look at that , he might have put on high grade prepared paint or clear white lead . he 's rich enough , -- but , no , just a quiet shingle stain is enough for him . i can not resist adding from the same source the list of the chief guests . anybody desiring a set of names for a burlesque show to run three hundred nights on the circuit may have them free of charge or without infringement of copyright .
that was a good idea , and proved triumphantly successful ; for , on arrival at montreux . the chancery barrister 's portmanteau turned up all right . the key innocently reposing on the handle , and , as subsequent investigation showed . the contents untouched , perhaps it was the influence of these varied incidents that led to a scene of some excitement on our arrival at montreux station . there , what was left of our luggage was disgorged , and of fourteen packages registered .
at seven o'clock we were at van cortlandt park . at eight we were at ninety sixth street , nine o'clock found [location] laboring up to the gate of the camp . with a written list of excuses that looked like the schedule of a flourishing railroad . it was accepted , much to our surprise , this was my first experience with camouflage . and it impressed me most unfavorably , an ordinary ship on a grumbling ocean is difficult enough as it is to establish friendly relations with .
you start , my friends , you stare ! think , then , how i stared and started at this sudden ending of our talk . there was the black muzzle and there the dark , angry eyes behind it . what could i do ? i was helpless , i raised my hands in the air . at the same moment voices sounded from all parts of the wood .
mr. [male] had been taken to the scene of the murder . had visited hilda grant , and by his own desire had examined the books . papers , and manuscripts in [male] rooms . and on the day of doran 's call . a longer drive than he had yet taken had been arranged , he was going .
twice i had to drop everything and find cloths to do up the horse 's legs . where it had grazed `` em a fallin '' out of the machine . and once i took my hands out of the pie crust to find a piece of old rope to tie up the harness . it seemed as if i left off every five minutes to wait on josiah allen . to find somethin that he wanted and could not find , or else to do somethin
this maddened [male] , he assumed the offensive , bill , satisfied for the moment with his success . had stepped back , and was indulging in some fancy sparring , when [male] upon him like a panther . they clinched , and [male] , who had got the under grip . hurled bill forcibly against a stout man who looked like a publican . the two fell in a heap , bill underneath .
she gave a sort of hiccup and . darting forward , kissed me on the forehead , unpleasant , of course . but , as anatole would say , i can take a few smooths with a rough . the next moment she was legging it for the dining room . while i , having bunged the bicycle into a bush .
mr. [male] edwardes said that if they injured seymour hicks in any way he would never smile again . a writer in answers pointed out that , if all the invaders in the country were piled in a heap . they would reach some of the way to the moon . in sporting circles the chief interest centered on the race to [location] . the papers showed the positions of the various armies each morning in their runners and betting columns .
the shock was so indescribably severe that miss [female] 's smile was frozen . so to speak , as by some sudden congealment on to her face , and did not thaw off it till she had reached the sharp turn at the end of the street . where she leaned heavily on the railing and breathed through her nose . a light autumnal mist overlay the miles of marsh . but the sun was already drinking it up , promising the tillingites another golden day .
he laughed inwardly to think how furious gombauld would be when he saw them arriving . gombauld was by no means so furious at their apparition as [male] had hoped and expected he would be . indeed , he was rather pleased than annoyed when the two faces , one brown and pointed . the other round and pale , appeared in the frame of the open door . the energy born of his restless irritation was dying within him .
but she is in society now ; and papa has to stand it . there is no avoiding it , very well , the great republic lengthened her skirts last year . balled up her hair , and entered the world 's society . this means that , if she would prosper and stand fair with society , she must put aside some of her dearest and darlingest young ways and superstitions . and do as society does , of course , she can decline if she wants to .
as my act and deed , love feeds on many kinds of food . i know , some love for rank . some for duty : some give their hearts away for empty show . and others for youth and beauty . to love for money all the world is prone .
to one who loves his fatherland , for instance , our boasted indifference to the ethics of a national war is mere mysterious gibberism . it is like telling a man that a boy has committed murder . but that he need not mind because it is only his son . here clearly the word `` love '' is used unmeaningly , it is the essence of love to be sensitive . it is a part of its doom .
so , too , an exceptionally stout and short winded old gentleman , who looks as if he had been living too well and taking too little exercise for the last forty five years . is not the heavy father , as you might imagine if you judged from mere external evidence . but a wild , reckless boy , you would not think so to look at him . but his only faults are that he is so young and light headed , there is good in him . however , and he will no doubt be steady enough when he grows up .
i dined once with a newly married couple who had just returned from their honeymoon . we ought to have sat down at eight o'clock ; we sat down instead at half past ten . the cook had started drinking in the morning . by seven o'clock she was speechless , the wife . giving up hope at a quarter to eight , had cooked the dinner herself .
as the initiated , it was believed , could not be drowned , perhaps they were put in a way to obtain a drier strangulation . the reason why these ceremonies were kept so successfully secret , is plain , each man . as he was let in , and found what nonsense it was , was sure to hold his tongue and help the next man in . as in the modern case of the celebrated `` sons of malta . '' it is to be admitted , however , to the credit of the cabiri .
what more natural , therefore , than that mr. [male] fyshe , before serving the soda to the duke . should try it on somebody else ? and what better person could be found for this than mr. [male] . the saintly young rector ofasaph 's , who had enjoyed the kind of expensive college education calculated to develop all the faculties . moreover , a rector of the anglican church who has been in the foreign mission field is the kind of person from whom one can find out . more or less incidentally , how one should address and converse with a duke , and whether you call him .
there was an old man of three bridges , whose mind was distracted by midges . he sate on a wheel , eating underdone veal . which relieved that old man of three bridges , there was an old man of [location] . who never did anything wrong ; he lay on his back . with his head in a sack , that innocuous old man of [location] .
it may be you are bound for the rialto . or for the bridge of sighs , which is chiefly distinguished from all the other bridges by being the only covered one in the lot . or for the house of the lady desdemona . the lady desdemona never lived there or anywhere else , but the house where she would have lived . had she lived , is on exhibition daily from nine to five , admission one lira .
it was an unpretending little place , with the bill of fare wafered to the door . and red curtains in the windows , setting off a display of joints . cauliflowers , and red herrings , he passed through into a long . low room , with dark brown grained walls , partitioned off in the usual manner . and taking a seat in a box facing the door .
but never before , i think , have christians called a turk a locust and meant it as a compliment . now for the first time we worship as well as fear . and trace with adoration that enormous form advancing vast and vague out of [location] . faintly discernible amid the mystic clouds of winged creatures hung over the wasted lands . thronging the skies like thunder and discoloring the skies like rain .
but why was it that these helpless men were not destroyed by the russians ? why was it that they were not speared by the cossacks or herded into droves . and driven as prisoners into the heart of [location] ? on every side as you watched the black snake winding over the snow you saw also dark . moving shadows which came and went like cloud drifts on either flank and behind .
pray let the whole house and furniture have a thorough cleaning from top to bottom . for the honour of wales ; and let person search into . and make a general clearance of the slit holes . which the maids have in secret ; for i know they are much given to sloth and uncleanness . i hope you have worked a reformation among them .
but it was not in the power of liquor to compose the fears of robin . he continued still waking in his chair , with his eyes fixed stedfastly on the door which led into the apartment of mr [male] . till a violent thundering at his outward gate called him from his seat . and obliged him to open it ; which he had no sooner done . than his kitchen was immediately full of gentlemen in red coats .
in short , to briefly sum the case , the winner takes the loser 's place . with all its obligations , all , how neatly lawyers state a case ! the winner takes the loser 's place . with all its obligations , strange the views some people hold ! two young fellows quarrel -- then they fight , for both are bold -- rage of both is uncontrolled .
the only reasonable explanation that [organization] was painting her portrait he dismissed . there had been no signs of any portrait , and [organization] 's embarrassment had been so obvious that . if there had been any such explanation , he would certainly have given it . no , ruth had been there for other reasons than those of art . every morning mrs. [female] called and .
the situation was primordial , the man beneath prevailed for a moment over the civilised superstructure , the draper . he pushed at the pedals with archaic violence . so palaeolithic man may have ridden his simple bicycle of chipped [male] in pursuit of his exogamous affinity . she vanished round the corner , his effort was titanic . what should he say when he overtook her ?
at the same time , he felt an undeniable thrill of pride at having beaten him . the feat presented that interesting person , [male] jackson . to him in a fresh and pleasing light , as one who had had a tough job to face and had carried it through . jackson , the cricketer , he knew . but jackson , the deliverer of knock out blows .
he lives in [location] , of course . in a drab coloured genteel house , and has everything about him that is properly grave . dismal , and comfortable , his dinners are in the morning herald . among the parties for the week ; and his wife and daughters make a very handsome appearance at the drawing room . once a year , when he comes down to the club in his deputy lieutenant 's uniform .
reprinted in this form from volume ii of mr. [male] 's speeches . each of these four addresses has been delivered before many large audiences , a record . in concise and interesting style , of the origin . growth , development , and mutations of the english language . it treats of literature and its elements .
[male] strolled down the road , scanning the gardens as he went . all had guelder roses , none had syringa , on a table in the window of a small house at the bottom of the road was a vase of syringa . he did not know who lived there , he entered the garden cautiously . no one was about , he looked into the room . it was empty , the window was open at the bottom .
but he had a misgiving that she might have been waylaid . and tempted into saying something that would criminate him when the news came . for anything he knew , she might have knocked at the door of his room . while he was away , and discovered his plot , confound her . it was like her pale face to be wandering up and down the house !
from that moment the sheep had begun to gather to the fold . that is to say , the camps -- and offer their valueless lives and their valuable wool to the `` righteous cause . '' why , even the very men who had lately been slaves were in the `` righteous cause , '' and glorifying it , praying for it , sentimentally slabbering over it . just like all the other commoners , imagine such human muck as this ; conceive of this folly !
`` she does it always , '' said an admiring lady in an audible whisper from the other side of miss [female] . `` she does it always , '' the admiring lady was the wife of a retired coachbuilder . who was painfully anxious to make her way into good evangelical society at littlebath . `` perhaps you will put in the sugar for yourself , '' said mrs stumfold to miss mackenzie as soon as she returned .
mr. [male] was the father of [organization] . one of the most historic piles i have ever clapped eyes on . it is now under the management of a classical janitor . who has a tinge of negro blood in his veins . mixed with the rich castilian blood of somebody else , he has been at the head of [organization] for over forty years .
among the warblers which abound in the vicinity of the metropolis . one of the most interesting is the little mudlark whose plaintive cry may nightly be heard upon the shore of the river . where these little creatures congregate in flocks , and pick up any grub which they may chance to meet with . doubts have been entertained by sundry cockney naturalists whether the pyramids of [male] shells . which in the early part of august used to be noticed in the streets .
to return to that first question , m. bourget . as teacher , would simply be [female] teaching [location] . it seemed to me that the outlook was dark . almost egyptian , in fact , what would the new teacher , representing [female] , teach us , railroading , no . [female] knows nothing valuable about railroading , steamshipping ? no , [female] has no superiorities over [location] in that matter , steamboating , no .
he had been pleased to marry her into so good a family . he had been delighted to think that by means of his prosperity in the world his father 's grand daughter might probably become a peeress . but he certainly had not intended that even for such a reward as that his daughter should become submissive to the old maids at manor cross . foreseeing something of this he had stipulated that she should have a house of her own in [location] . but half her time would probably be spent in the country , and with reference to that half of her time it would be necessary that she should be made to understand that as the wife of lord [female] she was in no respect inferior to his sisters .
there were a dozen exclamations ; a man [male] a cutaway coat left his place near the desk and advanced alertly . the stout person made a sort of lightning like spring toward the short . dark soldier , and then the lobby closed around the little group and blotted them from the sight of mr . [male] and mr. out , but to mr , [male] and mr. out this event was merely a particolored iridescent segment of a whirring , spinning world . they heard loud voices ; they saw the stout man spring .
yes , i said , but , gentlemen , before that toast is honoured i beg to propose to you a toast . the toast , always the premier toast in every gathering composed of english gentlemen . the joke was then mine , in the most perfunctory and glib manner i gave the royal toast . after it was duly honoured i gave the second loyal toast . `` the house of lords , '' `` the houses of parliament , ''
the body was gone , but otherwise nothing had been moved , [male] belonged to the magnifying glass school of detection . the first thing he did on entering the room was to make a careful examination of the floor . the walls , the furniture , and the windowsill . he would have hotly denied the assertion that he did this because it looked well . but he would have been hard put to it to advance any other reason .
the next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat . and they were all seated and busy , and still [female] did not come , mrs. [female] looked . and looked in vain , his father would not own himself uneasy . and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare . he had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty .
all the rest of the money you hear about does not exist . it is conversation money , when you hear of a transaction involving dollar 50,000,000 it means that one firm wrote `` 50,000,000 '' on a piece of paper and gave it to another firm . and the other firm took it home and said look , [male] . i got dollar 50,000,000 , but when [male] asked for a dollar and a quarter out of it to pay the man who washed the windows . the answer probably was that the firm had not got more than seventy cents in cash .
then he showed [location] another little job he would printed and had not charged for . because it was for us , it had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder . and `` dollar 200 reward '' under it . the reading was all about jim , and just described him to a dot . it said he run away fromjacques
[female] was not the typical lawyer , at cambridge . where bill had first made his acquaintance , he had been notable for an exuberance of which [male] 's inn fields had not yet cured him . there was an airy disregard for legal formalities about him which exasperated his father . an attorney of the old school , he came to the point . directly bill entered the room , with a speed and levity that would have appalled nichols senior .
and so we find him , one glorious june morning . seated at his desk , ready for the end . outside , the sun beat down upon the orderly streets of the village . dogs dozed in the warm dust , men who had to work went about their toil moistly . their minds far away in shady public houses , but mr meggs .
covering her face with her hands again , as if the passion which had sustained her through these disclosures lost itself in an overwhelming sense of shame and grief . she abandoned herself to tears . when she was more composed , she impressed upon [male] that this man she had described . was pecksniff in his real colours ; and word by word and phrase by phrase . as well as she remembered it , related what had passed between them in the wood .
i thanked his majesty for his politeness . and expressed how happy i was to meet so [male] and refined a people in the centre of [location] . and that i hoped to show myself and company grateful for his esteem . by introducing the arts and sciences of [location] among the people . these characters i have submitted to the inspection of a celebrated antiquarian .
`` i am an editor , and this is my editorial sanctum . '' not that i have ever seen an editor or a sanctum . but i have sent so many manuscripts to so many editors and received them back with such unfailing promptness . that the scene before me was as familiar to my eye as if i had been wide awake . as i thus mused , revelling in the charm of my surroundings and admiring the luxurious black alpaca coat and the dainty dickie which i wore .
i vowed that they should believe me . my genuine remorse and the absence of all concealment on my part would speak powerfully for me . i would choose a favourable time for my confession . that very evening i would tell all , then , to my horror , i heard a well-known ringing tramp on the road outside . and smelt the peculiar fragrance of a burmese cheroot , it was the colonel himself .
we now read , on an inscription in black letters . and , following the path indicated , we reached the dank tank where the monsters dwell . we had arrived at a place which i find it difficult to describe . the floor was smooth and hard , `` what do you make of this ? '' asked [female] . tapping her dainty foot on the floor , `` flags , ''
the bishop was well meaning , but forgetful , in planning his camp he had entirely overlooked the difficulty of food and water supplies . the one was a mile distant and could not be brought nearer . the other had been overcome by laying a pipe , at considerable expense , in the natural order of disaster the campers had arrived . and in a very few hours became tinctured with the heresy of anti clericalism . husbands quarrelled with wives as to who should bear the responsibility for the adventure to which they found themselves committed .
having had a full pitch hit for six and a half volley for four , there was a strong probability that mr . [male] would pitch his next ball short , the expected happened , the third ball was a slow long hop . and hit the road at about the same spot where the first had landed , a howl of untuneful applause rose from the watchers in the pavilion . and [male] , with the feeling that this sort of bowling was too good to be true . waited in position for number four , there are moments when a sort of panic seizes a bowler .
i do not say that the baron , in the following stories . means a satire on any political matters whatever , no ; but if the reader understands them so . i can not help it , if the baron meets with a parcel of negro ships carrying whites into slavery to work upon their plantations in a cold climate . should we therefore imagine that he intends a reflection on the present traffic in human flesh ? and that , if the negroes should do so , it would be simple justice .
at first she said nothing , he laid it carefully down on the branch near the half finished nest . and she stretched up her head and looked at it . then she looked at him , for about a minute neither spoke . i could see that the situation was becoming strained , when she did open her beak . it was with a subdued tone , that had a vein of weariness running through it .
mr. [male] had never quite understood how it was that his sister in law had turned against him . she had said nothing whatever as to where her sympathies lay . but mr. [female] instinctively felt that she had ranged herself on the side of the enemy . when the rev , mr. [female] . of the alton road chapel .
both boys felt that the financial side of their great affair had been conscientiously looked to . that the question of the reward was settled , and that everything was proceeding in a businesslike manner . therefore , they were able to turn their attention to another matter . this was the question of whitey 's next meal . after their exploits of the morning , and the consequent imperilment of penrod .
behind the britchka stood a second , but an empty , turn-out , drawn by four long coated steeds in ragged collars and rope harnesses . the flaxen haired man lost no time in ascending the staircase . while his darker friend remained below to fumble at something in the britchka . talking , as he did so , to the driver of the vehicle which stood hitched behind . somehow , the dark-haired man 's voice struck chichikov as familiar .
it was a peculiar custom of [male] 's to toss up a coin to decide questions of little consequence . and then do the thing the coin decided he should not do . it showed , in [male] 's estimation . his entire independence of those dull persons who supposed that in them was centred the destiny of all mankind . the fates , however , only smiled at these little acts of rebellion .
he might have added that he hated two sorts of men . all those who did him favours , and all those who were better off than himself . as in either case their position was an insult to a man of his stupendous merits . but he did not ; for with the apt closing words above recited , mr slyme . of too haughty a stomach to work , to beg , to [male] , or to steal .
[female] did his humble comrade these various ill turns partly out of native viciousness . and partly because he hated him for his superiorities of physique and pluck . and for his manifold cleverness , [male] could not dive . for it gave him splitting headaches . chambers could dive without inconvenience , and was fond of doing it .
it was after the first seance that the frenzy for spiritualism seized riseholme . the princess with great good nature , gave some further exhibitions of her psychical power in addition to the seances . and even as georgie the next afternoon was receiving [male] 's cruel verdict about debussy . the sybil was looking at the hands of colonel [male] and mrs [location] . and unerringly probing into their past , and lifting the corner of the veil .
one day i was listening to some conversation upon this subject when an [location] student said that for some time he had been under sentence for a slight breach of the peace and had promised the constable that he would presently find an unoccupied day and betake himself to prison . i asked the young gentleman to do me the kindness to go to jail as soon as he conveniently could . so that i might try to get in there and visit him , and see what college captivity was like . he said he would appoint the very first day he could spare . his confinement was to endure twenty-four hours , he shortly chose his day .
what mrs. [female] could have seen in [location] [female] to cause her to single him out from all the world passes comprehension . but the eccentricities of cupid are commonplace . it were best to shun examination into first causes and stick to results . the swift romance began and reached its climax in the ten days which it took one of the smaller atlantic liners to sail from liverpool to [location] . mr. [male] was on board because he was returning with a theatrical company from a failure in [location] .
he amazed betty with his stories of his reportorial adventures . he told them for the most part as humorous stories at his own expense . but the fact remained that in a considerable proportion of them he had only escaped a sudden and violent death by adroitness or pure good luck . his conversation opened up a new world to betty , she began to see that in [location] . and especially in [location] , anything may happen to anybody .
after i got over the jar to my pride ( which [male] . i truly think , never felt -- he was a born worshipper , and which terry never got over . he was quite clear in his ideas of `` the position of women '' ) , i found that loving `` up '' was a very good sensation after all . it gave me a queer feeling .
the rest of the company made it abundantly clear that bindle had expressed its sentiments . and ruddy bill subsided into sotto voce blasphemies . during these friday nights at the scarlet horse . many subjects came up for discussion ; marriage , politics . religion were dealt with in turn , but it was impossible to keep the talk away from the war .
will i be at your ball ? say , can a duck swim ? count on me sure , fred , it is also incorrect and somewhat boorish to write `` accepted '' across the face of the invitation and return it signed to the hostess . [female] regrets that she will be unable to accept the kind invitation of major general and mrs. hannafield for wednesday evening at half after eight . [female] regrets that , owing to an ulcerated tooth in the left side of her mouth . and severe neuralgic pains all up and down her left side .
he was of course uncertain as to her personal attractiveness . owing to that mysterious veil there was a doubt as to her surpassing beauty . at any rate he did not regret the time spent on his toilet . in this case the veil was of the east , [organization] . and what was more probable than that the `` mysterious veiled lady '' was that fascinating oriental young woman whose attainments in magic made her the dire terror of her enemies .
than this fair patrician dame , none is more prominent in the gay life of pompeii . it was she who last season smoked a cigarette in public . and there is a report now that she is seriously considering wearing an ankle bracelet . withal she is a perfect lady and belongs to one of the old southern families . her husband has been through the bankruptcy courts twice and is thinking of going through again .
we were quiet at the farm that night . [female] sat like [male] among the ruins of carthage . and refused to speak , eventually he took [male] with him and went for a walk . half an hour later i , too , wearied of the scene of desolation . my errant steps took me in the direction of the sea .
there was a sounding splash as willing hands urged the first of the captives into the depths . he ploughed his way to the bank . scrambled out , and vanished , it was here that the regrettable incident occurred , just as the second prisoner was being launched . constable butt , determined to assert himself even at the eleventh hour . sprang forward , and seized the captive by the arm .
and because peggy and her mistris , do in this manner . as it were , like a [female] in a box . jump into each others humour , the good woman may take her rest the better . for she hath caretakers enough about the house . and if the husband , coming from the change or other important affair .
before leaving old albion for my investigating flight of centuries . i was a painful witness to the decapitation of my great friend . sir [male] , whose heroic conduct at the block melted the spectators into tears . and brought down loud maledictions on the corrupt head of lord bacon . who was the principal villain in the final destruction of the great navigator .
the atmosphere brooding over the first tee when i reached it on the following morning . somewhat resembled that of a duelling ground in the days when these affairs were sealed with rapiers or pistols . person , an old friend of mine . was the only cheerful member of the party , i am never at my best in the early morning . and the two rivals glared at each other with silent sneers , i had never supposed till that moment that men ever really sneered at one another outside the movies .
mr. [male] spout having concluded his explanatory remarks . the entire party went into the pistol gallery before mentioned , to have a crack at the iron man . with the pipe in his mouth , the nature of mr. [male] 's profession . that of a teacher , was not such as would make him familiar with the use of fire arms . and , in point of fact , he had about as good a notion of pistol shooting as a stage horse has of hunting wild bees .
i think i was about 18 years of age when i decided that i would be a miller . with flour on my clothes and a salary of dollar 200 per month . this was not the first thing i had decided to be , and afterward changed my mind about . i engaged to learn my profession of a man called [male] , i believe . at least i will call him that for the sake of argument .
the master looked round the room , just showing his perfect teeth with the perfection of artistic cruelty . exalted for a moment in the enormous simplicity of his success . and then walked across the [male] and vanished through an inner door , his two lieutenants . [male] and [male] , were left standing at the head of the great army of servants and keepers . `` i hope we shall have no more trouble , '' said dr. [male] pleasantly enough .
the soldier laughed , loaded him well , and showed him the house of his lady . bidding him observe it well that he might know it another time . so that he might be able to send him there again without being obliged to accompany him . [organization] promised fidelity and good conduct . the soldier gave him three quartos , and the lad returned like a shot to the market .
but how glad all the old women in the world would be to shake their heads and say oh , no . my dear , believe me , it was not anything to do with her . i am told on the very best authority , and so forth , and so on . she knew he had told any number of undergraduates he was going to die for her . but they , poor fellows , could not bear witness .
i sank back into my chair and let the magazines slide to the floor . what fiction story was there in any one of them so enthralling as the actual possibilities that lay before me ? in two hours i might be bending over a pot of gold . a sea chest stuffed with pearls and rubies ! i began to recall all the stories i had heard as a boy of treasure buried along the coast by kidd on his return voyage from the indies .
on one of the upper branches of the congo river lived an ancient and aristocratic family of hippopotamuses . which boasted a pedigree dating back beyond the days of person . beyond the existence of mankind -- far into the dim ages when the world was new . they had always lived upon the banks of this same river . so that every curve and sweep of its waters .
[male] hurriedly disclaimed any immediate change of plans . he observed , however , to himself that the earlier heartiness of manner had in a large measure deserted the household . suspicious looks , sulky silences , or sharp speeches had become the order of the day . as for the old mother , she sat about the kitchen or the garden all day . murmuring threats and spells against [female] .
money ought never to be the consideration in marriage . but it always ought to be a consideration , when a boy and a girl do not think enough about money before the ceremony . they are going to have to think altogether too much about it after ; and when a man 's doing sums at home evenings . it comes kind of awkward for him to try to hold his wife on his lap . there 's nothing in this talk that two can live cheaper than one , a good wife doubles a man 's expenses and doubles his happiness .
danton , the man who wound up [male] before the revolution . darling , grace , a light house keeper 's daughter who showed the world that a woman may fear a mouse . but not a tempest , one of the truly brave who did not receive a [male] advertisement . [male] , [male] , a well-known enemy of preachers . he discovered that many men looked like their progenitors .
the grown-ups refuse to make way for you to pass and the swarming young ones repay you for not killing them by pelting pebbles and less pleasant things into your face . beggars in all degrees of filth and deformity and repulsiveness run alongside the carriage in imminent danger from the wheels . begging for alms , if you give them something they curse you for not giving them more . and if you give them nothing they spit at you for a base dog of a heretic . but then , what could you naturally expect from a population that thinks a fried cuttlefish is edible and a beefsteak is not ?
she did ask fräulein scherin . but fräulein denied all knowledge of the girl , `` i have so many freshmen , '' she apologized , `` i can not all of them with their queer names remember . '' priscilla kept hearing about the girl on all sides . but could never catch a glimpse of her , [female] called several times on business .
this intelligence changed , or rather made definite my plan , [male] was nothing to me now . the boy was everything , i must see him . and if he was what he was represented to be , a bright little fellow . i determined that he should no longer remain in the hands and under the control of his drunken step father . but i would carry him away with me if i could .
it was not , however , to speak of these things that i remembered the amateur and its lessons . my intention was but to lead up to the story of a certain small boy . who in the doing of tasks not required of him was exceedingly clever , i wish to tell you his story . because , as do most true tales , it possesses a moral , and stories without a moral i deem to be but foolish literature . resembling roads that lead to nowhere , such as sick folk tramp for exercise .
observing that several heads were turned towards the front door . the eyes of the big man had instinctively followed their direction . it was what he saw there that had caused him to pause in describing his offspring . standing very still , her face deathly pale , with no sign of her lips beyond a thin . grey line , stood mrs. [female] .
but here are we talking at the top of our voices whilst all the time our hero lies slumbering in his britchka ! indeed , his name has been repeated so often during the recital of his life 's history that he must almost have heard us ! and at any time he is an irritable , irascible fellow when spoken of with disrespect . true , to the reader chichikov 's displeasure can not matter a jot . but for the author it would mean ruin to quarrel with his hero .
he had communicated this design to mark , and was on the eve of escaping . when the door was thrown open in a great hurry , and an elderly gentleman entered . bringing with him a lady who certainly could not be considered young -- that was matter of fact . and probably could not be considered handsome -- but that was matter of opinion , she was very straight . very tall , and not at all flexible in face or figure , on her head she wore a great straw bonnet .
the extent of [male] 's repertoire surprised me . evidently he has not been so idle at cambridge as it seemed . young bute has a baritone voice of some richness . we remembered at quarter past eleven that [organization] ought to have gone to bed at eight . we were all of [location] surprised at the lateness of the hour .
[male] 's slows , it was generally anticipated that he would do something special with them . off the first ball of the master 's over a leg bye was run , mr . [male] was a bowler with a style of his own . he took two short steps , two long steps . gave a jump , took three more short steps , and ended with a combination of step and jump .
`` oo oo oo yer , '' he shouted again , as [male] . passing through the gate , turned into the road that led to the school . [male] 's attentive ear noted that the bright speech was a shade more puffily delivered this time . he began to feel that this was not such bad fun after all , he would have liked to be in bed . but , if that was out of the question , this was certainly the next best thing .
come back and reprove [location] again , come back and admonish [location] once more , at so much per admonish and groceries . we will agree to let you select the tender part of the steak . and such fruit as seems to strike you favorably , just as we did before . we did not like it when you were here . but that is because we were young and did not know what the custom was .
finding himself at liberty , the prince lost no time in running to the tree where he had left his kite . but on the way some of the boy monkeys discovered him and raised a great cry . which soon brought hundreds of his enemies in pursuit . zingle had a good start , however , and soon reached the tree . quickly he climbed up the trunk and branches until he had gained the limb where the string of his kite was still fastened .
what occurred now was by no means ordinary , and it distracted him like an electric shock . as he sat on the floor , passing a tender hand over the egg-shaped bump which had already begun to manifest itself beneath his hair . something cold and wet touched his face , and paralysed him so completely both physically and mentally that he did not move a muscle but just congealed where he sat into a solid block of ice . he felt vaguely that this was the end , his heart had stopped beating and he simply could not imagine it ever starting again . and , if your heart refuses to beat , what hope is there for you ?
the king and his people were having a game of ball that day . and the dog was acting as umpire , suddenly , just as prince [male] had made a home run and everybody was applauding him . a terrible roaring noise sounded in their ears . and they heard a great crashing of trees on the mountain side and saw a monstrous man approaching the valley . the people were so frightened they stood perfectly still , being unable to move through surprise and terror .
by this time you feel completely crushed , you bury your face in your hands and think you would like to die and go to heaven . you picture to yourself your own sick bed , with all your friends and relations standing round you weeping . you bless them all , especially the young and pretty ones . they will value you when you are gone . so you say to yourself , and learn too late what they have lost .
the morning was perfect , -- the most glorious of a glorious summer , there was a haze over the valley and out to sea which suggested a warm noon . when the sun should have begun the serious duties of the day . the birds were singing in the trees and breakfasting on the lawn . while [male] , seated on one of the flower beds , watched them with the eye of a connoisseur . occasionally , when a sparrow hopped in his direction , he would make a sudden spring .
but the professor did not go to the newspaper man 's office and shoot holes in his person . he spoke kindly to him always , and once when the two met in a barber shop . and it was doubtful which was `` next , '' as they came in from opposite ends of the room . the professor gently yielded the chair to the man who had done him the great wrong . and while the barber was shaving him eleven tons of ceiling peeled off and fell on the editor who had been so cruel and so rude .
all , now , this is the position : one was of low condition , the other a patrician . a many years ago , but , oh , bitter is my cup ! however could i do it ? i mixed those children up , and not a creature knew it , all . however could you do it ? some day . no doubt , you will rue it .
you can also get more concessions from your husband now . while he is a little rattled , and temporarily knocked silly by the pomp and pageant of marrying into your family . and if you work it right you can maintain this supremacy for years . treat him with a gentle firmness . and do not weep on his bosom if you detect the aroma of beer and bologna sausage on his young breath .
one day miss meechim and i visited an [location] mission school for arab and egyptian children . and it wuz from one of these very schools that one of the rajahs or native princes took his wife . she wuz a little donkey driver . and the teacher of the mission , liking her and pitying her . got permission of her mother ( a poor donkey driver of [location] living in a mud hut ) .
i shook him wider awake , he seemed to be drowsed with drink . and was fearfully emaciated , when i got him on his feet , i noticed then the deformity that characterised one of them . we assisted him through the aperture . and down into the dining room , where he cried out continually for something to eat . but when we placed food before him .
towards the end of the second week of term fate . by way of compensation , allowed dunstable a distinct stroke of luck . mr. [male] , the master of his new form . set him a hundred lines of [male] . and told him to show them up next day .
if he wakes or seems unusually restless , let me know , there 's nothing to do . he goes out quietly , but quickly , for there is another man down at the end of the corridor who is almost as sick . the nurse potters about the room for a moment or two . arranging whatever things it is that nurses arrange . she exits [female] , or , in other words .
queen , and now , tell me , with all the world to choose from . why on earth did you decide to live at the bottom of that stream , iol . to be near my son , strephon , queen . bless my heart . i did not know you had a son , iol . he was born soon after i left my husband by your royal command .
there can be no doubt that at least one chuzzlewit came over with [female] the conqueror . it does not appear that this illustrious ancestor `` came over '' that monarch . to employ the vulgar phrase , at any subsequent period . inasmuch as the family do not seem to have been ever greatly distinguished by the possession of landed estate . and it is well known that for the bestowal of that kind of property upon his favourites .
[male] had made shift to live many years by writing novels . at the rate of five pounds a volume . but that branch of business is now engrossed by female authors . who publish merely for the propagation of virtue , with so much ease and spirit . and delicacy , and knowledge of the human heart .
the duke had an intense horror of unmarried girls . all his vacations were spent in eluding them and their chaperons . that he should be confronted with one of them -- with such an one of them ! in oxford , seemed to him sheer violation of sanctuary . the tone , therefore , in which he said `` i shall be charmed , '' in answer to the warden 's request that he would take zuleika into dinner .
if every man in the house were a professional blackguard . and had his home in a sailor boarding house . one could still not understand it ; for , although that sort do use such terms . they never take them , these men are not professional blackguards . they are mainly gentlemen , and educated ; yet they use the terms .
it seems odd that it should be the only one , yet it must be so . for i have worn myself out these many weeks trying to find another one to add to my collection . and for this one to play with ; for surely then it would be quieter . and we could tame it more easily , but i find none . nor any vestige of any ; and strangest of all , no tracks , it has to live on the ground .
so soon may i follow , when friendships decay , and from love 's shining circle the gems drop away . when true hearts lie withered , and fond ones are flown , o ! who would inhabit this bleak world alone ? [organization] are [female] where early fa 's the dew . and it 's there that annie laurie gie would me her promise true . gie would me her promise true .
they were plainly apoplectic and disposed to snore , there were no staring portraits to remonstrate with you for being lazy . no round eyed birds upon the curtains , disgustingly wide awake . and insufferably prying , the thick neutral hangings , and the dark blinds , and the heavy heap of bed clothes . were all designed to hold in sleep , and act as nonconductors to the day and getting up . even the old stuffed fox upon the top of the wardrobe was devoid of any spark of vigilance .
but he had scarcely seated himself when in pops the little round man again . and without saying more than `` i see this is done on purpose to insult me ! '' he seized the young man by the collar of the coat behind . lifted him from the seat , and very dexterously slid himself into it . in an instant all was uproar : -- turn him out , -- throw him over !
`` he 's a blighter , '' was [male] 's verdict . mr [organization] made no comment . [male] was to learn later that the manager and the cashier . despite the fact that they had been together in less prosperous days . or possibly because of it -- were not on very good terms , mr [organization] was a man of strong prejudices .
i had to go into another car for a moment . and when i returned a pugilist from [location] had my seat . when i travel i am uniformly courteous , especially to pugilists , a pugilist who has started out as an obscure boy with no money . no friends , and no one to practice on . except his wife or his mother , with no capital aside from his bare hands .
he examined the scheme , the more he looked at it . the better it seemed , he was helped to this decision by the extraordinary perfection of the weather . the weather of late had been a revelation to ginger . it was his first experience of [location] 's indian summer . and it had quite overcome him , as he stood on the roof of mrs. [male] 's establishment on the saturday morning .
all of which is preliminary to the expression of the opinion that [female] . now playing at the century , is the funniest clown who has appeared in [location] this season . mr. [male] was discovered in a burlesque show by some astute theatrical scout several seasons ago . burlesque was several rungs higher in the ladder than his starting point . for his career included appearances in carnivals and the little shows which ply up and down some of the rivers .
the last two , owing to a passion for variety on the part of the bowler . were long hops , at the end of the over shields score was twenty-four , [male] pursued the same tactics . when the first wicket fell , seventy was on the board . a spirit of martial enthusiasm pervaded the ranks of the house team .
[male] chased the traitor home . and thus found out where he lived , he then held a position at the gate for some time . daring the enemy to come outside , but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined . at last the enemy 's mother appeared , and called [male] a bad . vicious , vulgar child , and ordered him away , so he went away .
as billy drew nigh with cautious steps , he perceived that , although worn and wasted by long illness . the patient was a man still in the very prime of life . his dark hair and beard , which he wore long . were untinged with gray , and his forehead showed no touch of age . his dark eyes were wide open , and his lips slightly parted , his whole features exhibiting an expression of energetic action .
`` man , '' here broke in doctor drummummupp . at the top of his voice , and with a thump that came near knocking the pulpit about our ears . man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live . he cometh up and is cut down like a flower , i started to the extremity of the pew . and perceived by the animated looks of the divine , that the wrath which had nearly proved fatal to the pulpit had been excited by the whispers of the lady and myself .
and , lastly , that this love , when it operates towards one of a different sex . is very apt , towards its complete gratification , to call in the aid of that hunger which i have mentioned above . and which it is so far from abating , that it heightens all its delights to a degree scarce imaginable by those who have never been susceptible of any other emotions than what have proceeded from appetite alone . to deny the existence of a passion of which we often see manifest instances . seems to be very strange and absurd ; and can indeed proceed only from that self admonition which we have mentioned above .
`` come along , '' he said , at last , and he began to move off down the road , sally followed . the possibility of refusing did not enter her mind , where are you going ? ', she asked . it was unbearable , this silence , in this fashion . he leading , she following , they went down the road into a lane . and through a gate into a field , they passed into a second field .
she was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already celebrated murderers . and she started on the errand at once , i slipped out the back way . locked the door behind me , put the key in my pocket and started off . chuckling to myself and comfortable , well , i had gone and spoiled it again . made another mistake , a double one , in fact , there were plenty of ways to get rid of that officer by some simple and plausible device .
in this last statement she was perfectly accurate , bream mortimer . who had been aroused by the orchestrion and who had come out to see what was the matter . had gone away at the rate of fifty miles an hour . he had been creeping down the passage when he found himself suddenly confronted by a dim figure which . without a word , had attempted to slay him with an enormous gun .
we , the undersigned citizens of worcester . [location] , practical carpenters , are personally acquainted with person . [location] , architect , and author of a work . entitled the `` carpenter 's assistant and rural architect . '' we have examined that work with attention .
parker entered with the toast , and derek resumed his breakfast . derek 's heavy eyebrows closed together in an offended frown . and seemed to darken his whole face , this unsolicited offer of assistance hurt his dignity . he showed a touch of the petulance which came now and then when he was annoyed . to suggest that he might not possess so strong a character as his exterior indicated .
vasling and his confederates retired to the other end of the cabin . and did not reply , it was then necessary to renew the supply of wood . and , in spite of the cold , [male] went on deck and began to cut away a part of the barricading . but was obliged to retreat in a quarter of an hour , for he was in danger of falling . overcome by the freezing air , as he passed .
in the days before he began to expend his surplus energy in playing rugby football . the welshman was accustomed , whenever the monotony of his everyday life began to oppress him . to collect a few friends and make raids across the border into england . to the huge discomfort of the dwellers on the other side . it was to cope with this habit that dreever castle .
having got through the time as best he could till eleven o'clock . he went up to bed , the room to which he and lucille had been assigned by the management was on the second floor . pleasantly sunny by day and at night filled with cool and heartening fragrance of the pines . [male] had always enjoyed taking a final smoke on the balcony overlooking the woods . but , to night such was his mental stress that he prepared to go to bed directly he had closed the door .
to go home to bed at nine o'clock . as early hours are good for the health , and because there is really nothing else to do . and last , but not least , to leave [location] for the country by the very first train tomorrow morning ! sigh no more dealers , sigh no more , shares were unstable ever , they often have been down before . at high rates constant never , then sigh not so , soon up they will go .
the proof of his disappearance was easy to find , as soon as i dared do so with discretion i ventured upon a few inquiries . the fact that he had been engulfed while still owing four months rent for his rooms , and that he had vanished without even having time to pay such bills as he had outstanding with local tradesmen . showed that he must have been devisualised at a moment 's notice . the awful fear that i might be held accountable for his death .
all the way north he pictured the maine guides . simple and strong and daring , jolly as they played stud poker in their unceiled shack . wise in woodcraft as they tramped the forest and shot the rapids . he particularly remembered [male] , half yankee , half indian . if he could but take up a backwoods claim with a man like [male] .
and her eyes looked as big and wild and wretched , as if she was lookin down the endless ages of eternity , a tryin to find her love , and knew she could not , all this was in her eyes . in her voice , but she seemed to conquer her emotion by a mighty effort . tried to smother it down , and speak calmly for the sake of her boy .
[male] was a warm supporter of the alphonso method . he was a bright young man and did not require a year to make up his mind that [male] had been set apart by fate from the beginning of time to be his bride . he had known it from the moment he saw her on the dock . and all the subsequent strolling , reading , talking , soup drinking , tea drinking , and shuffle board playing which they had done together had merely solidified his original impression . he loved this girl with all the force of a fiery nature .
the video tapes were very clear and very complete , there were a great many of them . and it was long after nine o'clock when [female] decided to take a break and get some fresh air . [location] was a good city for walking . even at night , and [male] liked to walk , sometimes he pretended . even to himself , that he got his best ideas while walking .
the river itself was full of interest . it was the highway to the outside world . rafts drifted by ; smartly painted steamboats panted up and down , touching to exchange traffic and travelers . a never ceasing wonder to those simple shut in dwellers whom the telegraph and railway had not yet reached . that [male] was a pleasant place of residence we may believe .
at six o'clock the sun began to drop behind a broad belt of black cloud that had settled over [location] . the mist following [location] ever since we crossed the river had overtaken us . even passed us , and was strewed out over the earth , the sky above our heads being yet a beautiful pale blue . we were passing with increased rapidity over the rich level land that stretches from the river bank to chelmsford . and there was time to look round at each other , [male] had come down from the netting and disposed his vast person amongst [location] and the bags of ballast .
he stepped across the papers to shake hands with his client . and then shook hands also with mr ball . whom he knew , his eye glanced at once down to the box . and after that over towards the pale faced clerk , mr ball perceived that the attorney had joined in his own mind the operation that was going on with these special documents . and the presence of these two special visitors ; and that he .
the moment he entered the room he was thunderstruck at beholding his own father and [location] 's . and to escape recognition he covered his face with a handkerchief . under pretence of wiping away the blood , the corregidor inquired what that young man had done who appeared to have been so roughly handed . the alguazil replied that he was a water carrier , known by the name of the asturian . and the boys in the street used to shout after him .
this was doubtless an extreme way of putting the case . yet it was in a certain sense exactly true , there is one of the geysers in iceland . into which visitors throw pebbles or turfs . with the invariable result of causing the disgusted geyser in a few minutes to vomit the dose out again . along with a great quantity of hot water , steam , and stuff .
they are the gaudy garments and flashy trappings for which she exchanged her honest laugh and her bright and beautiful youth . handle gently the poor little trunk , as you would touch her sad little history . for her father is in the second class coach , weeping softly into his coarse red handkerchief . and she , herself , is going home on the same train in her cheap little coffin in the baggage car to meet her sorrowing mother . who will go up into the garret many rainy afternoons in the days to come .
or any other club , in faultless evening dress . with a debonair smile on his face . he had broken open a safe , stolen bonds and jewelry to a large amount . and escaped without a blush of shame via the window . he had foiled a detective through four acts , and held up a band of pursuers with a revolver .
but old time had already lifted the glass to his lips . and the contents were rapidly running down , so mr bhosh , approaching a railway director . politely requested him to hook a horse box on to the next epsom train . what was his surprise to hear that this could not be done until all derby trains had first absented themselves ! with passionate volubility he pleaded that , if such a law of medes and persians was to be insisted on .
the landlord of the `` white boar '' was one of those men who need a beauty sleep . five minutes later mine host appeared in person . looking more than usually portly in a check dressing gown and red bedroom slippers of the dreadnought type . `` the five -- '' mr , [male] stared open mouthed at [male] for a moment . then he broke into a roar of laughter which shook the sporting prints on the wall and drew barks from dogs in some distant part of the house .
and he rang off , at that moment the gong sounded . and the genial host came tumbling downstairs like the delivery of a ton of coals . i always look back to that lunch with a sort of aching regret . it was the lunch of a lifetime . and i was not in a fit state to appreciate it .
in riding a horse the performer finds that the pedals in which he puts his feet will not allow of a good circular stroke . he will observe , however , that there is a saddle in which -- especially while the horse is trotting . he is expected to seat himself from time to time . but it is simpler to ride standing up , with the feet in the pedals . there are no handles to a horse , but the 1910 model has a string to each side of its face for turning its head when there is anything you want it to see .
[female] was forced to conclude that the brick house did belong to somebody , after all . wherefore , she remained in her own yard . a steadfast spectator , taking nourishment into her system at regular intervals . this was beautifully automatic : in each hand she held a slice of bread . freely plastered over with butter , apple sauce .
they should not move till they saw their own sweet and startling existence . they should not go from that place till they went home embracing like brothers and shouting like men delivered . from the cross from which he had fallen fell the shadow of its fantastic mercy . and the first three words he spoke in a voice like a silver trumpet . held men as still as stones , perhaps if he had spoken there for an hour in his illumination he might have founded a religion on ludgate hill .
she came a step nearer . looking up at him , their eyes met , `` she would say , '' said rutherford , slowly : `` '' i know you love me . and i know i can trust you . and i have not the slightest objection to your telling [female] the truth about her eyes .
true , little [male] was very young at this period , but even a little chap of two or three would understand most of that fireside talk . and get impressions more vivid than if the understanding were complete . he was barely four when this earliest chapter of his life came to a close . [male] had not remained satisfied with [location] and his undertakings there . the town had not kept its promises , it failed to grow .
miss mackenzie was sitting with her aunt when mr rubb called . they were both in the drawing room ; and lady ball . who had as yet succeeded in learning nothing , and who was more than ever convinced that there was much to learn . was not making herself pleasant to her companion , throughout the whole week she had been very unpleasant . she did not quite understand why [female] 's sojourn at the cedars had been and was to be so much prolonged .
[female] waited patiently till he had retrieved it . then he returned to the attack , [male] got up . and kicked the wall as a vent for his feelings . on the monday morning [male] passed the notice board just as burgess turned away from pinning up the list of the team to play the m.c.c . he read it , and his heart missed a beat .
he ill uses this female most shockingly -- not for any cause or motive whatever ; indeed , his own practical interests should prompt him to treat her well and keep friends with her . but from the natural cussedness to which we have just alluded , when he speaks to her he seizes her by the wrist and breathes what he 's got to say into her ear . and it tickles and revolts her , the only thing in which he is good to her is in the matter of dress . he does not stint her in dress , the stage villain is superior to the villain of real life . the villain of real life is actuated by mere sordid and selfish motives .
news came to vienna of the death of orion clemens . at the age of seventy two , orion had died as he had lived . a gentle dreamer , always with a new plan , he had not been sick at all . one morning early he had seated himself at a table . with pencil and paper , and was putting down the details of his latest project .
he spent most of his time building roads . time passed on , and [male] built viaducts . conduits , culverts , and rustic bridges . till it was november , and they were yet fifty miles from the fort . he then decided to abandon the expedition , on account of the cold .
his bulbous new shoes flashed back yellow fire at the embarrassed sun . and his collar sent forth other sparkles . playing upon a [male] surface over an inner graining of soot . beneath it hung a simple , white , soiled evening tie , draped in a manner unintended by its manufacturer . and heavily overburdened by a green glass medallion of the emperor tiberius .
most everyone knows what the bucking of the barbarous western horse means . the wild horse probably learned it from the antelope . for the latter does it the same way . i.e. , he jumps straight up into the air , at the same instant curving his back and coming down stiff legged . with all four of his feet in a bunch , the concussion is considerable .
a fellow has to be ready for that sort of thing . oh , ah , i said , and started to back out , halloa , [male] . do not go , we are just finishing for the day , that will be all this afternoon , he said to the nurse , who got up with the baby and decanted it into a perambulator which was standing in the fairway . corky stood there , looking at the door , and then he turned to me and began to get it off his chest .
or whether he would prefer a little something on `` is the garden of eden mentioned in the bible actually [location] ? '' naturally , if one were writing with [location] 's five o'clock in mind he would go on to make some comparison between [location] and the serpent . after extended deliberation , we decided that perhaps it would be best not to try to write for blank's at all . it might put a strain upon the versatility of a young man too hard for him to bear . suppose , for instance , he worked faithfully and molded his style to meet all the demands and requirements of five o'clock in the afternoon .
on top of all this she is the mother and home of that wonder of wonders . caste -- and of that mystery of mysteries . the satanic brotherhood of the thugs , it was the division of the country into so many states and nations that made thuggee possible and prosperous . it is difficult to realize the situation , but perhaps one may approximate it by imagining the states of our union peopled by separate nations . speaking separate languages , with guards and custom houses strung along all frontiers .
the thanks they offered to heaven , and to his father and mother . the congratulations on both sides ; the astonishment of [location] 's companions who saw him so unexpectedly married to so charming a bride on the very night of his arrival . and above all , when they learned from the statement openly made by doña estafania . that [location] was the very person whose abduction her son had effected with their aid . nor was [location] less surprised than they ; and the better to assure himself of so wonderful a fact .
sometimes he got away by himself , at others he deluded some hapless member of the company into following him . one young man , just called to the bar , had a promising career almost cut short on the second day . in the innocence of his heart he had followed the patriarch . who led him through an apparently impassable pine forest on to the crest of a remote hill . whence he crawled down an hour late for luncheon .
should a player who is thus thrown backward save himself from falling by sitting down in the lap of a female player . he scores one , any player who scores in this manner is entitled to remain seated while he may count six . after which he must remove himself or pay philopena no , 2 , should the player who controls the crank perceive a player upon the street desirous of joining in the game by entering the car . his object should be : primo , to run over him and kill him . secundo , to kill him by any other means in his power .
i was horrified , for the first time i realized vividly all that she had gone through . when she had spoken to me before of her struggles that evening over the study fire . i had supposed that they had begun only after her husband 's death . and that her life with him had in some measure trained her for the fight . that she should have been pitched into the arena , a mere child .
and the young girl took the line with trembling hand . while her swain plied the needle across the stitches of the embroidery . for hours together they thus exchanged soft words . and their hearts palpitated when the cork bobbed on the water . ah , could they ever forget those charming hours .
they passed through onto the stage , and found themselves in a world of noise and confusion compared with which the auditorium which they had left had been a peaceful place . smoke was everywhere , a stage hand , carrying a bucket . lurched past them , bellowing , from somewhere out of sight on the other side of the stage there came a sound of chopping . jill 's companion moved quickly to the switchboard . groped , found a handle , and turned it , in the narrow space between the corner of the proscenium and the edge of the asbestos curtain lights flashed up .
but it is no matter , i was not caring for those things . i am tired of them , any way , i think they are well enough . but one does not want them always hanging around , my interest was all in the southern cross . i had never seen that , i had heard about it all my life . and it was but natural that i should be burning to see it .
billy silver continued to occupy one end in an immovable manner , but at the other there was no monotony . man after man came in , padded and gloved , and looking capable of mighty things . they took guard , patted the ground lustily . as if to make it plain that they were going to stand no nonsense . settled their caps over their eyes , and prepared to receive the ball .
chapter vi -- in which the mistake of the landlord throws sophia into a dreadful consternation . chapter vii -- in which mrs fitzpatrick concludes her history . chapter viii -- a dreadful alarm in the inn . with the arrival of an unexpected friend of mrs fitzpatrick . chapter ix -- the morning introduced in some pretty writing , a stagecoach .
perhaps he fainted , or perhaps from numbness he slipped into a kind of deep sleep . whichever it was , he returned to consciousness again suddenly , his hands had slipped from his ears . and a sound had brought him back , he lifted his head and listened . the fire had burnt itself out now , the only noise was the hiss and pop of dying embers . but these sounds were too gentle to have awakened him -- it must have been something else .
after this my tailor took a lump of chalk and charted out a kind of queen rosamond 's maze of crossmarks on my breeches and said i might leave them . and that if surgery could save them he would operate . at any rate he guaranteed to cut them away sufficiently to admit of my breast bone coming out into the open once more . after these two experiences with the english tailor i gave up . instead of trying to wear the apparel of the foreigner i set myself to the study of it .
it would perhaps be best to telephone the next day to those guests whom you really want . and give them further details as to the date and time of the party . additional fun can be gotten out of this invitation by failing to put postage stamps on the envelopes when you mail them . the two cents which each guest will have to pay for postage due can be returned in a novel manner on the night of the party by inserting them in sandwiches or stuffed tomatoes . these clocks should then be delivered in the afternoon to those of the guests whom you are merely inviting because they are your husband 's business associates .
but the inspiration of [female] and huck gave out when the tale was half finished . or perhaps it gave way to a new interest . news came one day that a writer in [location] . without permission , had dramatized `` the gilded age , '' and that it was being played by [male] . an actor of much power , mark twain had himself planned to dramatize the character of colonel sellers and had taken out dramatic copyright .
daughters of solid and useful men ; sisters of rising young politicians like himself . nieces of [organization] 's peerage . he could have introduced without embarrassment one of these in the role of bride elect , but jill … oh . well , when once his mother had met jill , everything was sure to be all right . nobody could resist jill , it would be like resisting the sunshine .
`` how young you must be , then , miss mayton , '' said i. i suppose i looked at her as if i meant what i said . for , although she inclined her head and said , `` oh , thank you , '' she did not seem to turn my compliment off in her usual invulnerable style . nothing happening in the course of conversation ever discomposed [female] for more than a hundred seconds . however , so she soon recovered her usual expression and self command .
i had pressed my father to have a small greenhouse put up at my expense . he had always wanted one , but had never been able to run to it . and i had taken [male] about a good deal . our weekly visit to a matinee , followed by tea at the cabin or lyons popular , had become an institution , we had gone occasionally to a ball at the town [male] .
on the broad of my back floating free , floating free , on the broad of my back floating free , floating free ! ha , ha , ha , ha . ha , ha , ha , ha . ha , ha , ha ! ha . ha , ha , ha , ha .
spike gasped , his world had fallen about his ears . his excursion with , [male] , the master cracksman . in [location] had been the highest and proudest memory of his life . and , now that they had met again in [location] , he had looked forward to a long and prosperous partnership in crime . he was content that his own share in the partnership should be humble .
on taking my leave , i expressed unbounded satisfaction with such sport as i had had . and my fixed intention to assist on some similar shooting expedition , and mr bagshot kindly promised to let me know if he should again have vacancy for an additional gun . i regret to say that young howard , who , having only laid low a couple of black cocks and a blue hare . was immoderately jealous of my superior skilfulness , did seek to depreciate it by insinuating that my grouse was one which . having been seriously wounded by other hands some days previously , had come up to the hills to shuffle off its mortal coil in seclusion .
it is curious to reflect that my marriage destroys once and for all my life 's ambition . i have never won through to the goal i longed for . and now i never shall , ever since i can remember i have yearned to be known as a bohemian . that was my ambition , i have ceased to struggle now , married bohemians live in oakley street . king 's road , chelsea . we are to rent a house in halkett place .
he regards the life of bird and beast as no less sacred than that of human beings . should he inadvertently break a fowl or pig he will convey it to the nearest veterinary surgeon and have the broken limb set or amputated as the injury may require . in the event of death or permanent damage . he will seek out the owner of the dumb animal . and refund him fourfold , to be on the safe side with respect to the legal limit .
playing bagatelle for new hats , lady susanna felt that if ever there could come a time in which interference would be necessary that time had come now . she had resolved that she would be patient ; that she should not come down as an offended deity upon lady [female] . unless some sufficient crisis should justify such action , but now surely , if ever . she must interpose , playing at bagatelle with [female] baron for new hats . and she with the prospect before her of being marchioness of brotherton !
`` the tenant of old place ? '' asked [male] unerringly , `` yes , guess ! '' said georgie tantalizingly , this was his last revelation and he wanted to spin it out . [male] decided on a great stroke , involving risks but magnificent if it came off . in a flash she guessed why all the yoga class had come so super punctually . each of them she felt convinced wanted to have the joy of telling her .
accordingly after tea mrs. [female] set out . she had not far to go ; the big , rambling , orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynde 's hollow . to be sure , the long lane made it a good deal further . [male] 's father , as shy and silent as his son after him . had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead .
masculine voice from above -- person , where the devil have you put my shirts ? everything is upside down in my room , and i can not find them . i pulled every blessed thing out of the chiffonier and wardrobe . and they are not there , host ( from above , just as front door opens . admitting baron person gosheimer and two women guests ) .
an excellent example of the amateur at his best is to be found in the drawings of sir [male] . no one would resent less than lockwood himself having the term `` amateur '' applied to his work . indeed , he would , i am sure , have felt proud to be classed in the same category as several of our most popular humorous artists . circumstances connected with a curious coincidence concerning a caricature are worth confirming . one morning i was taking my usual horse exercise round the ride in the inner circle of regent 's park .
mr. [male] tells an [location] story of a young lady . who , being intensely loved by five young men , was advised to jump overboard . and marry the man who jumped in after her , accordingly , next morning . the five lovers being on deck , and looking very devotedly at the young lady . she plunged into the sea head foremost .
it was one of my uncle 's profoundest remarks that human beings are the only unreasonable creatures . this observation was so far justified by mr. [male] that . after spending the morning tortuously avoiding the other man in brown and the young lady in grey . he spent a considerable part of the afternoon in thinking about the young lady in grey . and contemplating in an optimistic spirit the possibilities of seeing her again , memory and imagination played round her .
but an awful creature who has met himself in the wilderness . the employers will give time to eat , time to sleep . they are in terror of a time to think . to anyone who knows any history it is wholly needless to say that holidays have been destroyed . as mr. [male] , who knows much more history than you or i .
in general , the donors expectation of gratitude was justified . but even so early as 1881 there were limits to artistic credulity ; and some offerings drove the club president . [organization] , and the club secretary . miss emma [female] , to `` the coal hold . '' this was a wee closet under the stairs , where the coal scuttles were ranged .
the real reason why i did not answer mr. [male] 's amusing attack was this . that one simple phrase in it surrendered to me all that i have ever wanted . or could want from him to all eternity , i told mr. [male] that he was a charming and clever fellow . but a common calvinist , he admitted that this was true , and there is an end of the matter . he said that , of course , calvin was quite right in holding that `` if once a man is born it is too late to damn or save him . ''
as it is , owing to the mistaken good nature of the rival generals . the date of the fixture was changed , and practically all that a historian can do is to record the result . a slight mist had risen as early as four o'clock on saturday . by night fall the atmosphere was a little dense , but the lamp posts were still clearly visible at a distance of some feet . and nobody , accustomed to living in [location] , would have noticed anything much out of the common .
every day brought one recurring , never failing source of speculation , this employer . would he come today , and what would he be like ? for [male] could not stop short at mr fips . he quite believed that mr fips had spoken truly , when he said he acted for another . and what manner of man that other was , became a full blown flower of wonder in the garden of [male] 's fancy .
this nobleman had an estate in the neighbourhood of fitzpatrick . and had been for some time acquainted with the lady , no sooner . therefore , did he hear of her confinement . than he earnestly applied himself to procure her liberty . which he presently effected , not by storming the castle , according to the example of antient heroes .
twenty love sick maidens we , now is not this ridiculous , and is not this preposterous ? they all prefer this melancholy literary man , bun . yes . oh , it 's you , -- i am better now , the poem is finished . and my soul has gone out into it , that was all , it was nothing worth mentioning . it occurs three times a day .
a violet by a mossy stone half hidden from the eye ! fair as a star , when only one is shining in the sky , she lived unknown . and few could know when [female] ceased to be ; but she is in her grave . and , oh , the difference to me , happy the man . whose wish and care a few paternal acres bound , content to breathe his native air in his own ground .
if they ever adopt the `` menti meter tests '' on this journal i shall last just about forty five minutes . and the trouble is that each test starts off so easily , you begin to think that you are so good that no one has ever appreciated you . there is for instance , a series of twenty-four pictures ( very badly drawn too . mr. [male] stockbridge , you think you are so smart . picking flaws with people 's intelligence .
but upstairs , away upstairs in a sitting room of his own grandfather [male] was looking with an affectionate eye at the presents that stood beside him . there was a beautiful whisky decanter , with silver filigree outside for [male] . and for the little boy a big nickel plated jew 's harp . later on , far in the night , the person , or the influence . or whatever it is called [male] claus .
rodolfo laid hold on leocadia . caught her up in his arms , and ran off with her , whilst she was so overcome with surprise and terror . that far from being able to defend herself or cry out , she had not even sense or sight left to see her ravisher . or know whither he was carrying her , her father shouted , her mother shrieked . her little brother cried , the servant maid tore her own face and hair .
it is no longer so very laudable for a young man to pay his way through college . and [male] had done this easily and without caring to be praised or martyrized for doing so . he had enjoyed his college days . he had been popular with town and gown . and he had managed to get his share of undergraduate fun while leading his classes .
meantime , a wag of a fellow , an intimate friend of briarly 's . appeared in market street in an old rusty coat . worn hat , and well mended but clean and whole trowsers and vest , friend after friend stopped him . and , in astonishment , inquired the cause of this change . he had but one answer , in substance .
in the height of the tourist season it is not always possible for one who wishes to leave [location] to spring on to the next boat . a long morning 's telephoning to the offices of the cunard and the white star brought mrs. [female] the depressing information that it would be a full week before she could sail for england . that meant that the inflammable eustace would have over two weeks to conduct an uninterrupted wooing . and mrs. [female] 's heart sank . till suddenly she remembered that so poor a sailor as her son was not likely to have had leisure for any strolling on the deck during the voyage on the `` atlantic . ''
[ softly clinging close to hedda , ] oh , how happy i am , hedda ! for only think . he says i have inspired him too . but seriously , i think you ought to -- for your own sake , otherwise people might be apt to suspect that . in your heart of hearts -- you did not feel quite secure . quite confident in yourself , i saw it plainly in judge brack 's face a moment ago .
says the spirit , `` have not you ? just you wait till next tuesday , my boy . '' unconsciously we are crediting fate with our own human weaknesses . if a man standing on the edge of a pond said aloud . `` i have never fallen into a pond in my life , '' and we happened to be just behind him , the temptation to push him in would be irresistible .
later he came round to me . he assured me that he did not catch my name when he asked for it . but when i was speaking he recognised me and was glad to have the opportunity of making my acquaintance . it appeared he had bought many hundreds of `` romps '' books for children and given them to children 's hospitals and other institutions . so he had besides an odd volume a good heart .
this time i broke a mirror -- there were two in the room . i got the largest one , of course , [female] woke again . but did not complain , and i was sorrier than ever , i resolved that i would suffer all possible torture before i would disturb him a third time . the mouse eventually retired , and by and by i was sinking to sleep , when a clock began to strike . i counted till it was done , and was about to drowse again when another clock began , i counted .
yes , but when i banished her , i gave her all the pleasant places of the earth to dwell in . i am sure i never intended that she should go and live at the bottom of a stream ! it makes me perfectly wretched to think of the discomfort she must have undergone , leila . think of the damp , and her chest was always delicate , queen . and the frogs , ugh , i never shall enjoy any peace of mind until i know why iolanthe went to live among the frogs , fleta .
this , o beloved of mine , ends the first part of the tale ! he ran through the desert ; he ran through the mountains . he ran through the salt pans ; he ran through the reed beds . he ran through the blue gums . he ran through the spinifex ; he ran till his front legs ached .
as for the ordinary recreations of the country house . the guests could frequent the billiard room . where they were sure to find lord stockheath playing a hundred up with his cousin . algernon wooster -- a spectacle of the liveliest interest . or they could , if fond of golf .
in pursuance of his overnight promise to derek , [organization] rooke had got in touch with jill through the medium of the telephone immediately after breakfast . and had arranged to call at ovingdon square in the afternoon , arrived there , he found jill with a telegram in her hand . her uncle christopher , who had been enjoying a breath of sea air down at brighton . was returning by an afternoon train , and jill had suggested that [organization] should accompany her to victoria . pick up [male] , and escort him home .
she meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at mr. [male] 's . and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr. [male] . even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr. [female] . her father 's comfort was amply secured , mrs. [female] as well as mrs. goddard being able to come . and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house .
we celebrated christmas by sleepin till a quarter to seven instead of hap past six . only they forgot to tell the fello what blows the horn an he blew it at hap past six anyway . imagine if anybody home had told me i could sleep till a quarter of seven christmas morning . i guess you know what id a told him . eh , mable ? theres a fello in town what says he will send flowers anywhere you want by telegraph .
the foyer of the opera in [location] may be a fine sight . but i doubt if it can compare with the inside of eliot 's drug store in mariposa . for real gaiety and joy of living . this night the store was especially crowded because it was a saturday and that meant early closing for all the hotels . except , of course , smith 's , so as the hotels were shut .
the judges , i knew , were becoming impatient , and , withal , my situation was growing more embarrassing every second . so i e'en resolved to try the soap stick without further parley , i stepped out . and the most intense interest was excited all around me , and it flashed like electricity around the target . as i judged from the anxious gaze of all in that direction . policy dictated that i should fire with a falling rifle .
he was a wonder to the yeomanry of warwickshire and the surrounding counties . and when he had occasion to rest for the night at farm houses or taverns . he was the prime favorite of the rural flames or bouncing , beaming barmaid . the girls went wild about him , the physical development of shakspere was as noticeable as his mental superiority . often when he ploughed the placid waters of the avon .
i cross my floor with a nervous tread . i whistle and laugh and sing and shout . i flourish my cane above his head , and stir up the fire to roast him out . i topple the chairs , and drum on the pane . and press my hands on my ears , in vain !
he was buried in the usual manner , and a large amount of obloquy heaped on him . that is one advantage of being great , after one 's grave is filled up . one can have a large three cornered chunk of obloquy put on the top of it to mark the spot and keep medical students away of nights . greatness certainly has its drawbacks , as the duchess of bloomer once said to the author . after she had been sitting on a dry goods box with a nail in it .
he felt grand and strong and full of beans , what a ripping thing life was when you came to think of it . `` this , '' he said , `` is perfectly extraordinary , '' and time stood still . a sense of something incongruous jarred upon bill . something seemed to be interfering with the supreme romance of that golden moment . it baffled him at first , then he realized that he was still holding eustace by the tail .
the sound of a distant gun , to zuleika , with all the chords of her soul strung to the utmost tensity . the effect was as if she herself had been shot . and she clutched at the duke 's arm . like a frightened child , he laughed , `` it was the signal for the race , '' he said , and laughed again , rather bitterly , at the crude and trivial interruption of high matters .
it must have been intended as a part of his argument . and i regard it as of as much force as anything he said after it . but in point of fact the question does not turn upon the person . but upon the principle , i have received an anonymous letter containing the following among other things . beware how you attack the holy cause of woman .
there was an old man of coblenz , the length of whose legs was immense . he went with one prance , from [location] to [male] . that surprising old man of coblenz , there was an old man of calcutta . who perpetually ate bread and butter ; till a great bit of muffin . on which he was stuffing , choked that horrid old man of calcutta .
an ounce of self respect -- and there are figures to show that yeggs average three and a quarter . would keep a crook from continuing in his bungling way after observing the manner in which [male] opens the door of a safe merely by sandpapering his fingers . what sort of person do you suppose could go and buy nitroglycerine ungrudgingly after that ? even by the least optimistic estimate of human nature , the worst we could expect from a criminal who had seen the play would be to have him make a gallant and sincere effort to employ the touch system in his own career . such attempts would be easy to frustrate , night watchmen could creep up on the idealists and catch them unaware .
i think that the money which she lent to the firm should . at any rate , be deducted , said [male] , speaking this with a kind of proviso to himself . that the words so spoken were intended to be taken as having any meaning only on the presumption that that document which he had seen in the other room should turn out to be wholly inoperative and inefficient at the present moment . in answer to these side questions or corollary points as to the deduction or non deduction of the loan . mr slow answered not a word ; but when there was silence between them .
in good truth it is very pleasant to see how the good womans apron from day to day . how longer the more it rises ; now all the world may plainly see you have behaved your self like a man . and every one acknowledge that you are both good for the sport . verily this is a great pleasure , and it increases abundantly , when your wife comes to be so near her reckoning . that she feels her self quick .
meanwhile squinty had tried his best to find a way out of the cornfield . but all he did was to walk up one row , and down another , if he had been tall enough to stand up and look over the tops of the corn stalks . he might have seen which way to go , but he was not yet large enough for that . pretty soon squinty looked up , and he saw that the sun was not as bright as it had been . squinty knew what this meant , the sun was going down , and it would soon be night .
martin said nothing in reply . but soon afterwards fell asleep , and remained so for an hour or more , when he awoke . finding it had ceased to rain , he took his seat beside the driver . and asked him several questions ; as how long had the fortunate guard of the light salisbury been in crossing the atlantic . at what time of the year had he sailed .
september 19 , general price , who , with van dorn . had considered it a good time to attack grant . who had sent many troops north to prevent bragg 's capture of north america . decided to retreat , and , general rosecrans failing to cut him off , escaped , and was thus enabled to fight on other occasions . the two confederate generals now decided to attack the union forces at corinth .
on the evening before her father came to town there was another ball at mrs. [female] . this old lady , who had no one belonging to her but an invisible old husband . was the gayest of the gay among the gay people of [location] . on this occasion [male] was to have gone with lady brabazon . who was related to the germains , and lord [male] had arranged an escape for himself .
meantime the corpse is burning , also several others , it is a dismal business . the stokers did not sit down in idleness , but moved briskly about , punching up the fires with long poles . and now and then adding fuel , sometimes they hoisted the half of a skeleton into the air . then slammed it down and beat it with the pole . breaking it up so that it would person better .
i knocked at the door with my stick two or three times . the impertinence of this man was nothing . i scarcely noticed it , it was so trivial in comparison with the scandalous conduct of gowing . at this moment cummings and his wife arrived . cummings was very lame and leaning on a stick ; but got up the steps and asked what the matter was .
he considered -- remembered -- yesterday he had had no dinner . it was the girl 's day out and kitty had lain in her room eating chocolate drops . she had said she felt `` smothery '' and could not bear having him near her . he had given [male] a bath and put him to bed . and then lain down on the couch intending to rest a minute before getting his own dinner .
mr. [male] , who had been entangling himself frightfully in intricate calculations upon the blackboard . without making a single convert , was only too glad to take advantage of the suggestion . and paul followed the rest into the playground with a sense of relief . the usual [organization] was going on there , with more spirit than usual , perhaps , because the darkness allowed of practical jokes and surprises . and offered great facilities for paying off old grudges with secrecy and despatch .
but this was not the end of it , lady [female] lawle declared that she could not be happy unless mr. and mrs. [female] would bring [female] home for the holidays to [female] lawle park . of course she carried her blessings up into mrs. [female] 's little drawing room . and became quite convinced , as was mrs. wortle , that mrs. [female] was in all respects a lady . she heard of mr. [female] 's antecedents at oxford . and expressed her opinion that they were charming people .
the pleasure i received from yours , which came to hand yesterday . is not to be expressed , love and friendship are , without doubt , charming passions . which absence serves only to heighten and improve , your kind present of the person bracelets . i shall keep as carefully as i preserve my own life ; and i beg you will accept . in return , my heart housewife , with the tortoise shell memorandum book , as a trifling pledge of my unalterable affection .
however , it is the pipe rather than the tobacco which marks him as belonging to this particular school . he pins his faith , not so much to its labour saving devices as to the white spot outside . the white spot of an otherwise aimless life . this tells the world that it is one of the pipes . never was an announcement more superfluous , from the moment , shortly after breakfast .
i went back , and springing lightly over the iron railing while the gatekeeper was thinking over his glorious past . i went all around over the theater looking for mr. [male] . i found him haggling over the price of some vegetables which he was selling at the stage door and which had been contributed by admirers and old subscribers to mr. [male] at a previous performance . when mr. [male] got through with that i presented to him my card . which is as good a piece of job work in colors as was ever done west of the [location] river .
[female] had come to [location] with a team of the m.c.c . which was touring the cricket playing section of [location] , psmith had accompanied him in a private capacity . it was the end of their first year at cambridge . and [male] , with a century against oxford to his credit . had been one of the first to be invited to join the tour , psmith , who had played cricket in a rather desultory way at the university .
time for the second step in the plan of campaign ! i touched a button , and shook the bones of england loose from her spine ! in that explosion all our noble civilization factories went up in the air and disappeared from the earth . it was a pity , but it was necessary . we could not afford to let the enemy turn our own weapons against us .
at that supreme moment it came across him that he would have done wiser to dismount . he gave a frantic `` whoop '' and tried to get round . then , as he seemed falling over , he pulled the handles straight again and to the left by an instinctive motion . and shot behind her hind wheel . missing her by a hair 's breadth , the pavement kerb awaited him .
it had been decided , after many discussions on the subject . that she and her husband should go up to town for a couple of months after christmas . lady [female] going with them to look after the porter and arrowroot . and that in march she should be brought back to manor cross with a view to her confinement . this had not been conceded to her easily , but it had at last been conceded .
calico jam , the little fish swam over the syllabub sea . he took off his hat to the sole and the sprat . and the willeby wat : but he never came back to me ; he never came back . he never came back , he never came back to me . calico ban , the little mice ran to be ready in time for tea .
but , with a superhuman struggle , he got them free . with the loss only of one of his fingers , by which time the current had blown him across the room and directly in front of my fender . to keep from going up the chimney , he tried to brace himself against this with his feet . but missing the rail , as helpless as a feather . he floated , toes first , into the fireplace .
who that has duly considered [male] 's instructions to his squire would not have taken him for a person of singular intelligence and discretion ? but , in truth , as it has often been said in the progress of this great history . he raved only on the subject of chivalry . on all others he manifested a sound and discriminating understanding . wherefore his judgment and his actions appeared continually at variance .
he imitated her , with a grotesque exaggeration . yelling loudly , `` take nurse ? '' then he planted a soap sud on her fresh cheek . she wiped it off carefully , and smacked his arm . the next moment she was gone , having left the door open . `` he wants me to go to [location] tomorrow , ''
the above words , written in our characters , are sregnah dna skoohtop . that is , the scythians are of heavenly origin , the word sregnah . which signifies scythians , is compounded of sreg or sre . whence our present english word sire , or sir . and nah , or gnah , knowledge , because the scythians united the essentials of nobility and learning together .
it is out of my power to return , in short my dear [female] it is my sensibility for the sufferings of so many amiable young men . my dislike of the extreme admiration i meet with . and my aversion to being so celebrated both in public , in private , in papers . and in printshops , that are the reasons why i can not more fully enjoy . the amusements so various and pleasing of [location] .
you are all buildin houses today that you think are more endurin ' . but what you build today -- hopes built upon worldly wealth . worldly fame , household affection . political success -- ah i will they not pass away like the green moss houses down in the woods back of the old schoolhouse ? yes , they , too , will pass away , so utterly that only their dust will remain .
he pointed to the vessels lying at the wharves . and then gave a vague flourish with his stick , as if he would include the air and water . generally , in this remark , the gentleman glanced at him with a knowing look . and said he liked his policy , it was natural . he said , and it pleased him as a philosopher to observe the prejudices of human nature .
when he at last became a free man again , he said he believed he would hunt up a brisker seat of learning . the heidelberg lectures might be good , but the opportunities of attending them were too rare . the educational process too slow ; he said he had come to [location] with the idea that the acquirement of an education was only a matter of time . but if he had averaged the heidelberg system correctly . it was rather a matter of eternity .
why did not my father buy them for me . as pets , for my birthday and let me keep them till i grew up ? if i had my life over again , no school or education for me ! not with all this beautiful mud and these tar paper shacks and corner lot fruit stores lying round ! i would buy out the whole united states and take a chance .
fitz , : leave it to me . i will manage it , it 's a common situation . why not settle it in the english fashion ? [organization] . . it 's very simple , in [location] , when two gentlemen are in love with the same lady . and until it is settled which gentleman is to blow out the brains of the other .
his eye fell on a tray bearing a decanter and a syphon . [male] was still silent , the reflection was doubtless philosophic , but it failed to comfort him . bad news spreads quickly , by the quarter to eleven interval next day the facts concerning wyatt and mr. [male] were public property . [male] , as an actual spectator of the drama . was in great request as an informant , as he told the story to a group of sympathisers outside the school shop .
there was a silence that hurt , it was broken by two sounds . occurring simultaneously in different parts of the room , one was a gasp from lady [female] . the other was a crash of glass , for the first time in a long unblemished career [female] the butler had dropped a tray . `` what shall we do ? '' said [female] , she was sitting on the stone seat where [male] byng had sat and meditated on his love for alice faraday and his unfortunate habit of slicing his approach shots . to [male] , as he stood beside her .
this multiplicity of troubles falling together on to the poor man 's back almost crushed him . he had returned to town full of that terrible letter which he had pledged himself to write . but the letter was already driven out of his head for the time . it was essentially necessary that he should compose this domestic trouble . and of course he returned to his wife .
i shall be awfully glad to see you both but as i say it would be better if you let me come to [location] where you and father will be ever so much more comfortable . your loving daughter , [female] , i am very glad that you have been elected president of [location] . [female] , and i hope that now you will have sense enough to see dr. [male] about your teeth . it would be well to have him give you a thorough looking over at this time . and mrs. peasely has given me the name of a splendid throat specialist in [location] whom i wish you would see as soon as possible .
guarded the pigeons of his square and the tourist who dwelt within his canals . martini , manufacturer of an [location] before dinner drink which tastes too good . [female] , a young girl who was presented with a famous lamb . seldom was seen without the animal , conveyed it to school with her one day . thus causing considerable mirth among the pupils , was severely reprimanded by the teacher .
i read it once and was amazed , i read it a second time and was , tempted . it was mine , the writer himself had authorized me to treat it as if it were my own . had voluntarily sacrificed his own claim to its authorship that he might relieve me of my very pressing embarrassment . not only this ; he had almost intimated that in putting my name to his work i should be doing him a favor . why not do so , then , i asked myself ; and immediately my better self rejected the idea as impossible .
what then followed [male] is unable to describe in detail , he has a confused recollection of having . immediately on starting , received a violent blow in the small of the back from the butt end of number five 's scull . at the same time that his own seat seemed to disappear from under him by magic . and leave him sitting on the boards , he also noticed . as a curious circumstance , that number two was at the same instant lying on his back at the bottom of the boat .
so mr , [male] had had to be content with day drill , the alarm bell hung in the archway . leading into the school grounds , the end of the rope . when not in use , was fastened to a hook halfway up the wall . [male] , as he raced over the cricket field . made up his mind in a flash that his only chance of getting out of this tangle was to shake his pursuer off for a space of time long enough to enable him to get to the rope and tug it .
i was just expecting he would come out with that , for a moment the man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and an impatience to go out and spread it . then a sudden something else betrayed itself in their faces , and they began to ask questions . i answered the questions myself . and narrowly watched the effects produced , i was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who these three prisoners were had somehow changed the atmosphere . that our hosts continued eagerness to go and spread the news was now only pretended and not real .
how long this had been going on he did not know , but obviously it was a thing to be investigated . the window was open at the bottom , and just outside the window were what he took to be the bars of another and larger cage . as a matter of fact they were the railings which afforded a modest protection to number nine . they ran the length of the house . and were much used by small boys as a means of rattling sticks .
she did not speak , presently , filling space , there sprang into being an odour . and as it reached him mr ferguson stiffened in his chair . bracing himself as for a fight to the death . it was more than an odour , it was the soul of the cocoa singing to him . his fingers gripped the arms of the chair .
it was one of those topping mornings , and i had just climbed out from under the cold shower . feeling like a two-year-old , as a matter of fact , i was especially bucked just then because the day before i had asserted myself with [male] . absolutely asserted myself , do not you know , you see . the way things had been going on i was rapidly becoming a dashed serf . the man had jolly well oppressed me , i did not so much mind when he made me give up one of my new suits .
this is a nicety which makes not the heart sore at [location] . he entered the room thus set off , with his hair dressed in the first style . and with a handsome bouquet in his breast. -- in a word . there was that look of festivity in everything about him . which at once put me in mind it was sunday .
[male] is an altogether charming old town , famous , so he learnt from a guide book . as the scene of master tupper 's great historical novel of stephen langton . and it has a delightful castle , all set about with geraniums and brass plates commemorating the gentlemen who put them up . and its guildhall is a tudor building . very pleasant to see , and in the afternoon the shops are busy and the people going to and fro make the pavements look bright and prosperous .
well , even if that were so , which is more important to the world ? which is more important to your `` great humanitarian work '' ? ah , very clever ! a bluff to gain my consent to marrying him . a trick to get his salary raised , [male] , nothing you can do . nothing you can say , will ever gain my consent to marrying him .
when the proper time comes , and if he is where you expect to find him while thinking of your upper c . you will hit him lightly on the shoulder with your sword . and then he can die to his own particular tune , if you have been severely wounded in battle . or in any other sort of row , and have got to sing a long ballad before you finally expire . you do not want to have to think how a man would really behave who knew he had only got a few minutes to live and was feeling bad about it .
but the agency was unable to get him any engagements . they happened , however , to receive a request from mr. [male] . manager of the side show , asking for a tasmanian wild man . and mr. [male] had taken that job . to his own surprise , he made an excellent wild man .
he has bushy eyebrows and is clean shaven , his chin itches considerably . so that he has to be always scratching it , his favorite remark is `` ah ! '' in real life we have heard of young solicitors . of foppish solicitors , of short solicitors ; but on the stage they are always very thin and very old . the youngest stage solicitor we ever remember to have seen looked about sixty .
the senior member of the firm , the departed hoppy . having promised to retain the youth in his employ at increased wages . until he was old enough to go to [location] , and assist him in looking after the interests of his clients abroad . an investigation , which followed , showed that [male] had celebrated his departure in the manner indicated . and also divulged the interesting fact that the running expenses of the office .
beyond these watchers on the threshold was the door marked `` private . '' through it , as jill reached the outer defences . filtered the sound of a piano , those who have studied the subject have come to the conclusion that the boorishness of [location] theatrical managers office boys can not be the product of mere chance . somewhere , in some sinister den in the criminal districts of the town .
mcginnis 's court was a democratic expression of some obstinate and radical property holder . occupying a limited space between two fashionable thoroughfares , it refused to conform to circumstances . but sturdily paraded its unkempt glories , and frequently asserted itself in ungrammatical language . my window -- a rear room on the ground floor . in this way derived blended light and shadow from the court .
the tender mother , when terrified with the apprehension that her darling boy is drowned . is struck senseless and almost dead with consternation ; but when she is told that little master is safe . and the victory only , with twelve hundred brave men . gone to the bottom , life and sense again return . maternal fondness enjoys the sudden relief from all its fears .
i am inclined also to hesitate about accepting the bulgarian throne for another reason . i do not care to be deposed when i want to do something else , i have had my deposition taken several times and it did not look like me either time . i think that you monarchs ought to stand by each other more , if you would form a society of free and independent monarchs there in [location] . where you are so plenty , you could have a good time and every little while you could raise your salaries if you worked it right . now you pull and haul each other all the time and keep yourselves in hot water day and night .
upon our sea girt land at our enforced command reform has laid her hand like some remorseless ogress . and made [location] darkly rue the deeds she dared to do . and all is owing to those hated flowers of progress , so down with them ! so down with them , reform 's a hated ogress . so down with them , so down with them , down with the flowers of progress !
very few of the rooms at mrs. [female] 's boarding house struck any note of luxury . mrs. [female] was not one of your fashionable interior decorators . she considered that when she had added a morris chair to the essentials which make up a bedroom . she had gone as far in the direction of pomp as any guest at seven and a half per could expect her to go . as a rule , the severity of his surroundings afflicted ginger with a touch of gloom when he went to bed .
we forthwith began to class and set apart the articles designed for sale . under the direction of an upholder from [location] . and , that nobody in the house might be idle , commenced our reformation without doors . as well as within , with baynard 's good leave , i ordered the gardener to turn the rivulet into its old channel . to refresh the fainting naiads , who had so long languished among mouldring roots .
you know that i am a man of dignity . that i am not a school boy and a lover of childish tricks ; and knowing that . your friendship , at least , should have restrained your tongue and pen when , through the former . on wednesday , you accused me of perpetrating a trifling . and to you excessively embarrassing , practical joke -- a charge which .
he had no notes , he talked with prodigious rapidity and energy for an hour . then the students began to remind him in certain well understood ways that his time was up . he seized his hat , still talking , proceeded swiftly down his pulpit steps . got out the last word of his discourse as he struck the floor . everybody rose respectfully , and he swept rapidly down the aisle and disappeared .
the coarsest and bluntest knife which ever broke a pencil into pieces instead of sharpening it is a good thing in so far as it is a knife . it would have appeared a miracle in the stone age . what we call a bad knife is a good knife not good enough for us . what we call a bad hat is a good hat not good enough for us . what we call bad cookery is good cookery not good enough for us .
it always takes a considerable time to see the simple and central fact about anything . all sorts of things have been said about the modern press . especially the yellow press ; that it is jingo or philistine or sensational or wrongly inquisitive or vulgar or indecent or trivial . but none of these have anything really to do with the point . the point about the press is that it is not what it is called .
in order to be certain who the guitar carrier was , they waited until the next time the lights were put out . took each a mouthful of dry flour , and blew it out right among the `` manifestations . '' when the lamps were lighted , lo and behold ! there was [male] , the agent and manager of the davenports . with his back all powdered with flour , [male] showed this to an acquaintance .
one day he meets a yogi . who tells him that if he desires to track the murderer down he must learn concentration . he suggests that [male] should start by concentrating on the word `` wardrobe , '' and then leaves this story and goes back to [location] , [male] his house in the country and comes back to town . where he concentrates for half an hour daily on the word `` wardrobe , ''
[male] had returned from aldershot on that occasion cheerful . but in an extremely battered condition , his appearance as he limped about the field on sports day had been heroic . and , in addition , a fine advertisement for the punishing powers of the ripton champion . it is true that at least one of his injuries had been the work of a pauline whom he had met in the opening bout . but the great majority were presents from ripton .
the ivy , however , must follow in some measure the humors and windings of the oak . but they grow together , and the longer they continue the more closely they are united . there have been many instances of great attachment , [female] , the wife of [female] . when she heard of her husband 's death swallowed burning coals that she might go with him . alceste , wife of admetus king of thessaly .
he could hear her above the band and the singing of the multitude . she seemed intent on spoiling everything . marjorie [female] was weeping to show how sorry she was that she had formerly slighted him . and throwing kisses to prove that she loved him . but miss spence kept jumping between him and marjorie .
`` a very good , idea , i will make a note of that , '' said a squeaky little voice at her side , [female] to her feet in surprise . she had supposed she was alone , and for a moment she was frightened . but a glance around reassured her , for strange to say , seated on the radiator warming his toes was her old friend the hatter . the queer old chap she had met in her marvellous trip through wonderland .
and the seven young fishes , swimming with great and uncomfortable velocity , plunged also into the mud quite against their will . and , not being accustomed to it , were all suffocated in a very short period . and that was the end of the seven young fishes , seven young parrots . and the seven young storks , and the seven young geese , and the seven young owls . and the seven young guinea pigs , and the seven young cats .
you know how i began -- i was started off with a kick . but that proved a kick up , and in the end every one since has lifted me a little bit higher . i got two dollar a week , and slept under the counter . and you can bet i knew just how many pennies there were in each of those dollar . and how hard the floor was , that is what you have got to learn .
the main episodes are a journey to the centre of the earth by means of a pit bored by an automatic cartridge . and a journey to the north pole beneath the ice of the polar seas . these adventures mr. [male] describes with such simplicity and conviction that the reader is apt to take the story in all seriousness until he suddenly runs into some gigantic pleasantry of the kind that was unknown before mr. [male] began writing . and realizes that the novel is a grave and elaborate bit of fooling . based upon the scientific fads of the day , the book is richly illustrated by [male] .
no other constellation makes so much talk , i had nothing against the big dipper . and naturally could not have anything against it , since it is a citizen of our own sky . and the property of [location] -- but i did want it to move out of the way and give this foreigner a chance . judging by the size of the talk which the southern cross had made . i supposed it would need a sky all to itself .
mr. [male] 's manner was so firm that the other man began to doubt whether in truth he had a secret to tell . could it be possible that dr. wortle knew it all , and that the neighbours knew it all . and that , in spite of what had happened , the position of the man and of the woman was accepted among them ? they certainly were not man and wife . and yet they were living together as such , could such a one as this dr. wortle know that it was so ?
your smiles , dear one , have all the glad surprise the sunshine hath for roses . what the day brings to the waiting lark , when you are gay my spirit sings in tune . and sorrow flies away , but , dear , i can not bear your sighs when on my knees you nestle and you lay your tear wet face upon my shoulder . nay , i can not help the pain that fills mine eyes . so , love , whatever cup of life you drain i will stand for .
or send myself , or one of myselfs , off to injy , while the other one of me stayed to jonesville . now , honestly speakin ' , it do not seem to me that i ever could learn to do this . not at my age , any way , and most dead with rheumatiz a good deal of the time . but then agin i have seen believers in theosiphy that could do wonders . and seemed indeed to have got marvelous control over the forces of natur .
his remarks were cut short by a crash at the other end of the room . there was a sharp cry and the splintering of glass . the place was full of a sudden , sharp confusion , they jumped up with one accord . lady wetherby spilled her iced coffee . lord wetherby dropped the lamp of love , claire , who was nearest the pillar that separated them from the part of the restaurant where the accident had happened .
the lieutenant returned his civility , commended his resolution . shook him by the hand , and invited him to dine with himself and the rest of the officers . the lieutenant , whom we mentioned in the preceding chapter . and who commanded this party , was now near sixty years of age . he had entered very young into the army , and had served in the capacity of an ensign at the battle of tannieres .
after a time they roused themselves from their grief and looked about for [female] . they found her , she lay among the sand and seaweed . her fair hair soaked in gasoline , then they looked about for [male] mcshamus . him , too , they found , lying half buried in the grass and soaked in whisky . then they looked about for [female] , they found her lying across the door of the cottage half buried in [male] 's breeches .
all i do know is what the landlord tells me , and that is that at five a.m. thirteen cabs containing thirteen sleeping souls pursued their thirteen devious ways to thirteen different houses . thus indicating that the dreamers were ultimately adjourned , and , as they have not met since . i presume the adjournment was , as usual , sine die . the scene of mr. [male] 's novel is laid in the twentieth century . which is imagined as the culmination of our era of science and invention .
of course mrs. [female] had an opinion . which she sedately expounded , in spite of harriet , who said that colours were unnecessary for children . and of [female] , who said that they were ugly , she was getting proud of irma . who had certainly greatly improved , and could no longer be called that most appalling of things . a vulgar child , she was anxious to form her before her mother returned .
cecil 's first movement was one of irritation . he could not bear the [male] habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture . instinctively he give the curtains a twitch . and sent them swinging down their poles , light entered . there was revealed a terrace , such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it .
mr. [male] fell back into his seat with a gasp . it was hard to be accused of caricaturing one 's own self , particularly when conscious of entire innocence in that respect . but even this was slight in comparison with the discovery that he had been so blindly deceiving himself ! the doctor evidently had failed to penetrate his disguise , and the dreaded scene of elaborate explanation must be gone through after all . the boys still found exquisite enjoyment in this extraordinary and original exhibition .
also squinty had the oddest nose , it was just like a rubber ball . flattened out , and when squinty moved his nose up and down , or sideways . as he did when he smelled the nice sour milk the farmer was bringing for the pigs dinner , why , when squinty did that with his nose . it just made you want to laugh right out loud .
wall , we wuz invited to meet the young female after the lecture wuz over . to be introduced to her and talk it over , wall , i wuz introduced to her . and i shook hands with her . and kissed her on both cheeks , for she is a sweet girl and i liked her looks . i could see that she was very , very sentimental , but she had a sweet .
after he had crawled over the window display to pull down the front shade at five thirty every afternoon . and said good-bye to the mysterious mr. [male] and the lady clerk . miss mccracken , and the lady stenographer . miss masters , he went home to the girl , [male] . he did not eat supper with [female] .
the powers of a committee varied according to the determination and truculence of the members of it . on any definite and important step , affecting the welfare of the fifteen . the [male] theoretically could not move without their approval , but if the [male] happened to be strong minded and the committee weak . they were apt to be slightly out of it , and the [male] would develop a habit of consulting them a day or so after he had done a thing . he would give a man his colours .
his face lit up , of course he knew where . not so far either , his arm swept three fourths of the horizon . he should just think he did know where , he pressed his finger tips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her . as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge , more seemed necessary , what was the italian for `` clergyman '' ? `` dove buoni uomini ? '' said she at last , good ?
yesterday 's performance , however , stood in a class by itself . it stood forth without disguise as a deliberate rag . one side does not keep another in the field the whole day in a one-day match except as a grisly kind of practical joke , and mr . [male] and his house realised this , the house 's way of signifying its comprehension of the fact was to be cold and distant as far as the seniors were concerned . and abusive and pugnacious as regards the juniors , young blood had been shed overnight .
who , in the course of his evangelical mission , had come hither in person . at length , we set out for the banks of lough lomond . passing through the little borough of dumbarton , or dunbritton . where there is a castle , more curious than any thing of the kind i had ever seen . it is honoured with a particular description by the elegant buchanan .
she seemed as pleased as if she had done it herself . as for the other one , she was a cantankerous , disagreeable old thing , as discouraging to me as her friend was helpful . `` ba a ad , da a a m ba a a d , '' was her comment on almost every stroke . as a matter of fact , some were really excellent strokes . but she did it just to be contradictory , and for the sake of irritating .
i will confess to you that cavalry are not of much use in a siege . although there was a time when i would not have permitted anyone to have made such an observation . the hussars of conflans were encamped to the south of the town . and it was their duty to throw out patrols and to make sure that no spanish force was advancing from that quarter . the colonel of the regiment was not a good soldier .
after these words master zacharius fell into complete silence . till he knocked at the door of his house . and for the first time since his convalescence descended to his shop . while gerande sadly repaired to her chamber , just as master zacharius crossed the threshold of his shop . one of the many clocks suspended on the wall struck five o'clock .
but mr pecksniff was a man of meek endurance . and mr jonas was his friend , moreover , his regard for that gentleman was founded . as we know , on pure esteem . and a knowledge of the excellence of his character . he came out from the tavern with a smiling face .
mr. [male] was the originator of the scheme . and let [male] into it ; and together they went to work . they had a few hundred dollar in cash . no particular credit , an entirely unlimited fund of lies . a good deal of industry , plausibility , talk .
the railroad from above was coming through , and blowout was to be a city with that mysterious and rather disconcerting abruptness with which tiny western villages do become cities in these circumstances . something much more important was arranged by providence , however -- at least , more important in the eyes of the children of the wagon tire house . [organization] grand aggregation of talent was to be in blowout for a week . and the human performers were stopping at huldah sarvice 's hotel . if one can go far enough back to remember the awe and mystery surrounding a circus .
he would have to do that himself , then he wrote down instructor in water colour . and as soon as he had written it he said right off that he would have to take that over too . there was no one else that he could trust it to . then he said , now , let me see , perspective , freehand , and crayon work . i need three men : three men of the first class .
the words of them songs hai not got hardly any sense . as we earthly bein 's count sense . there are scores of great singers , whose trained voices are a hundred fold more melodious . but these simple strains move us , thrill us . they jest get right inside of our hearts and souls .
he paused , and beamed rather freely , to show that this was comedy , i could have told the man it was no use . not a ripple , the corn chandler leaned against me and muttered `` whoddidesay ? '' but that was all , it 's always a nasty jar to wait for the laugh and find that the gag has not got across . the bearded bloke was visibly discomposed , at that , however , i think he would have got by . had he not , at this juncture , unfortunately stirred gussie up again .
apart from this he had few worries , certainly none serious enough to keep him awake . he was sleeping now , his head on his right arm . a sterilized teddy bear clutched firmly in his other hand , with the concentration of one engaged upon a feat at which he is an expert . the door opened slowly , a head insinuated itself into the room . furtively , as if uncertain of its welcome , the door continued to open and [male] slipped in .
nothing could exceed their quiet courage , let me pay them that tribute . i was laid out in my shroud in a long chair and tied down to it ( i think i was tied down . perhaps i was fastened with nails ) , this part of it was a mere nothing . it simply felt like being tied down by three strong men armed with pinchers . after that a gas tank and a pump were placed beside me and a set of rubber tubes fastened tight over my mouth and nose .
and whatsoever guard he kept upon himself . he could not help listening , and showing that he listened . whether he attended to their talk , or tried to think of other things . or talked himself , or held his peace , or resolutely counted the dull tickings of a hoarse clock at his back . he always lapsed , as if a spell were on him .
regarding the `` joliest books '' necessary for your perusal , in order to chisel your name on the eternal tablets of fame . tastes will certainly differ , i am almost sorry that you wrote to me . because we might not agree , you write like one of these `` joly '' humorists such as people employ to go along with a picnic and be the life of the party . and whose presence throughout the country has been so depressing , if one may be allowed to judge of your genius by the few autograph lines forwarded . you belong to that class of brain workers upon whom devolves the solemn duty of pounding sand .
it is thus we first observe that rising young screen actor . [male] armytage , beginning the tenth day of his determined effort to become much more closely identified with screen activities than hitherto . ten days of waiting outside the guarded gate had been his , but no other ten days of his life had seemed so eventful or passed so swiftly . for at last he stood before his goal , had actually fastened his eyes upon so much of it as might be seen through its gate . never had he achieved so much downright actuality .
the great motor mystery. -- at lancaster two motorists were fined . according to the manchester evening news , for driving a motor car over a trap near carnforth . at twenty nine and thirty four miles per hour respectively , we are of the opinion that the action of the second gentleman in driving at so high a speed over the poor trap when it was already down was not quite in accordance with the best traditions of english sport . the duchess of pomposet was writhing , poor thing . on the horns of a dilemma , painful position , very .
it seemed to [male] that his aunt spoke somewhat vehemently . even snappishly , in correcting what was a perfectly natural mistake , he could not know that the subject of letting windles for the summer was one which had long since begun to infuriate mrs. [female] . people had certainly asked her to let windles , in fact . people had pestered her , there was a rich , fat man , an [location] named [female] . whom she had met just before sailing at her brother 's house in [location] .
but elnathan had done well ; i admitted it only when i wuz too much put upon . he had gone fur west , got rich , invested his capital first rate . some on it in a big eastern city , and had got to be a millionare . and i spoze she wuz oncommon , not from what her pa said . no , i did not take all his talk about her for gospel ; i know too much .
that carpentier ought to be a fifty to one favorite in the betting . it was the technique of the frenchman which blinded [male] to the truth . every man in the world must be in some respect a standpatter . the scope of heresy in [male] stops short of the prize ring . his radicalism is not sufficiently far reaching to crawl through the ropes , when carpentier knocked out beckett with one perfectly delivered punch he also jarred [male] .
she told [female] that it was a portrait of [male] butler . when [male] is twenty one he will come into undisputed possession of the two liberty bonds and the card of thrift stamps for which miss x and i starved and scraped . i rather hope he will thank us . but beyond that i expect nothing except good advice , i can see him now squaring his shoulders . as becomes a man of property and independent income .
who would believe that the budding hoodlum before us . with the yellow chilblain on his heel and the early spring toad in his pocket . which he will present to the timid teacher as a testimonial of his regard this afternoon . may be the [male] who will lead the america people forty years hence into the glorious sunlight of a promised land . he may possibly do it , but he does not look like it now .
d was papa 's white duck . who had a curly tail ; one day it ate a great fat frog . besides a leetle snail , e was a little egg . upon the breakfast table ; papa came in and ate it up as fast as he was able . f was a little fish , [male] in the river took it papa said , [male] , [male] !
just at that moment he happened to look at his watch . and the sight was like a douche of cold water . the hands stood at five minutes to one , let [location] pause and ponder on this point for a while . let [location] not dismiss it as if it were some mere trivial , everyday difficulty . you , dear reader , play an accurate .
humph , said d'artagnan , i do not yet know whether m. fouquet wishes to fortify belle isle . but , at all events , here are some spiritual munitions for the castle . then , enchanted with his rich discovery , he ran upstairs again , and resumed his place at the table . d'artagnan had learnt what he wished to know , he , however . remained , none the less , face to face with his partner .
that may be a slight exaggeration , she knew , perhaps , that he was the new junior teller in the exchange bank and that he came from the maritime provinces . and that nobody knew who his people were , and that he had never been in a canoe in his life till he came to mariposa . and that he sat four pews back in dean drone 's church . and that his salary was eight hundred dollar , beyond that , she did not know a thing about him . she presumed , however , that the reason why he went past so fast was because he did not dare to go slow .
prodigious multitudes were assembled to behold the elevation of the `` royal [female] , '' and as soon as i began to fill my balloon with inflammable air the vessel evidently began to move . but when my balloon was completely filled , she carried up the `` royal [female] '' with the greatest rapidity , the vessel appearing on the surface occasioned a universal shout of triumph from the millions assembled on the occasion . still the balloon continued ascending , trailing the hull after like a lantern at the tail of a kite .
my acquaintance with my great uncles , [male] and [male] . was not particularly intimate and in later years they are seldom spoken of by members of the family for reasons sufficiently obvious to need no mention here . every family must sooner or later develop an undesirable or two , and on the whole i think that we have done tolerably well in having up to this time only one portrait in our rogues ', gallery . just what has become of [male] no one at this writing is aware . but wherever he is i hope when these memoirs of mine are published he will read them far enough to note that one member of the family at least holds him in pleasant recollection for the fun he has afforded him in the past .
if it should ever be urged by grudging and malicious persons , that a chuzzlewit . in any period of the family history . displayed an overweening amount of family pride . surely the weakness will be considered not only pardonable but laudable , when the immense superiority of the house to the rest of mankind . in respect of this its ancient origin .
dannie snow giggling outright , mr. [male] turned and gazed at him in mild inquiry . young potter turned a dull red , he was addicted to radiant cravats and [location] silk handkerchiefs . and from his `` salary '' of eight dollar a week he did not save much . but just the same , mr. [male] had been staggered at the price , pretending still to examine the knife which [male] had given him . he squinted past it at the contents of the glass show case on which his elbows rested .
`` for them , sir , '' he ejaculated . he hesitated , then without a word went into the house . a hearty cheer went up as he reappeared with the case . i proceeded indoors in search of glasses and water . coming out , i realised my folly in having left [male] alone with our visitors even for a minute .
the athenian replied that he would if the other would fetch him a frog . for the lake was near , to this he agreed , and when he was gone the athenian took the frog . and , opening its mouth , poured some stones into its stomach . so that it did not indeed seem larger than before , but could not jump . the boeotian soon returned with the other frog , and the contest began , the second frog first was pinched .
the first member of the staff of peaceful moments to arrive at the office on the following morning was master maloney . this sounds like the beginning of a `` plod and punctuality , '' or `` how great fortunes have been made '' story , but , as a matter of fact . master maloney , like mr . [male] , was no early bird , larks who rose in his neighborhood , rose alone .
the bars were down , and we could all go there now , and we did . our parents and all -- day after day . the cat began to strain herself , she provided the top of everything for those companies . and in abundance -- among them many a dish and many a wine which they had not tasted before and which they had not even heard of except at second hand from the prince 's servants . and the tableware was much above ordinary , too , in any community , big or little .
a week later chicago and the greater part of [location] was placarded with `` the crimson cord . '' perkins did his work thoroughly and well , and great was the interest in the mysterious title . it was an old dodge , but a good one . nothing appeared on the advertisements but the mere title . no word as to what the crimson cord ', was .
we are determined not to welcome the story again until it appears in a revised form . in the version which we favor , prince charming will try the glass slipper upon cinderella . and then turn away without enthusiasm , remarking in cutting manner , it is not a fit . your foot is much too small , one of the ugly sisters will be sitting somewhat timidly in the background . and it will be to her the prince will turn , exclaiming rapturously : `` a perfect number nine ! ''
it was happy that the baroness , with all her intelligence . was incapable of guessing this , but gradually it struck [female] that visiting old women might be . if not a natural , at least , as they say of some articles of diet . an acquired taste , the baroness was certainly a very amusing old woman . she talked to him as no lady .
the higholdboy had brought with him a pair of boxing gloves . which he announced were to be used in this wise : he was determined to keep order in the meetings . and this , too , even if he had to resort to severe means to do so . but actuated by the same feelings of benevolence which animated the legislators who caused the passage of laws to prevent cruelty to animals . he did not want to do physical injury to the refractory members of the club .
i sat there in an ice cold perspiration , until my nerves required more bracing . to effect which i had recourse to the spirit case . and after a short time my fears began to melt away rapidly , what a ridiculous bugbear i was making of this thing after all ! was i not too hasty in setting it down as ugly and hostile before i had seen it ... how did i know it was anything which deserved my horror ?
but he has a wife and family . you respect their feelings , smile and smile . and are villain enough to be civil with your lips , and hide the poison of asps under your tongue . till you have a chance to relieve your o'ercharged heart by shaking your fist in impotent wrath at his retreating form . you will receive the reward of your hypocrisy .
as [male] promenaded the high street , his manner was one of expectancy . twice he looked at his watch and , when walking in the direction of putney hill . he would turn and cast backward glances along the high street . during his second perambulation he encountered mrs. [female] hurrying in the direction of mr. [male] 's new shop . he accorded her a salute that would have warmed the heart of a chief commissioner of the police .
another day had generally begun before i moved from my hiding place . and started for home , surprised to find my limbs stiff and my clothes bathed with dew . it would be interesting to know to what extent the work of authors is influenced by their private affairs . if life is flowing smoothly , are the novels they write in that period of content coloured with optimism ? and if things are running crosswise , do they work off the resultant gloom on their faithful public ?
the autumn leaves turned green and vigorous again , while georgie went to get refreshment for his conqueror . and they were all introduced , she allowed herself to be taken with the utmost docility . how unlike somebody -- into the tent with the thrones . she confessed to having stood on tiptoe and looked into mrs quantock 's garden and wanted to see it so much from the other side of the wall . and this garden , too -- might she go and wander all over this garden when she had finished the most delicious peach that the world held ?
outside of the residency fence was an immense host of hostile and confident native besiegers . inside it were 480 loyal native soldiers , 730 white ones . and 500 women and children , in those days the english garrisons always managed to hamper themselves sufficiently with women and children . the natives established themselves in houses close at hand and began to rain bullets and cannon balls into the residency . and this they kept up , night and day .
at the next corner whitey turned to the right into the cross street . thence , turning to the right again and still warmly pursued , he zigzagged down a main thoroughfare until he reached another cross street . which ran alongside the schofields yard and brought him to the foot of the alley he had left behind in his flight . he entered the alley , and there his dim eye fell upon the open door he had previously investigated . no memory of it remained ; but the place had a look associated in his mind with hay .
the president , therefore , had said yes to mr. [male] 's invitation with alacrity . and had taken a look through the list of his more incompetent professors to refresh his memory . the duke of dulham had landed in [location] five days before and had looked round eagerly for a field of turnips . but had not seen any , he had been driven up fifth avenue and had kept his eyes open for potatoes . but there were none , nor had he seen any shorthorns in central park .
it shows how , by help of time . a story can grow -- even after [male] has had the first innings in the telling of it . mr. [male] told me the story himself , years ago . he said that the permission to buy jumbo was not a concession . the purchase was made and the animal delivered before the public knew anything about it .
my instinct is correct enough ; it is the earth that is wrong . i led them by the middle road . that the middle road had not character enough to continue for any quarter of a mile in the same direction . that after three miles up and down hill it ended abruptly in a wasps nest , was not a thing that should have been laid to my door , if the middle road had gone in the direction it ought to have done .
[male] spent his summers here for a number of years . and wrote weekly letters to the [location] papers . signed `` uno , '' in which he urged the taxpayers to show more veneration for their royal nibs . napoleon iii occupied the palais in summer during his lifetime . availing himself finally of the use of mr .
he says he is , she runs her fingers through his hair . he kisses her on the bare shoulder . this is also symbolic , lady cicely rattles on about amalfi and fiesole . she asks mr. [male] if he remembers that night in the olive trees at [male] . with just one thrush singing in the night sky .
this day he took eggs with his breakfast . intending to wheedle his appetite with a lighter second meal than it had demanded the day before . he must see if this would not average better on the day 's overhead . after breakfast he was irresistibly drawn to view the moving picture of his old home being dismantled . he knew now that he might stand brazenly there without possible criticism .
[male] and his friend took a front seat . as soon as the lights were put out they put out their legs too . stretching as far as possible ; and , to use the unfeeling language of mr. [male] . they `` soon had the satisfaction of feeling some one falling over them . '' they then caught hold of an arm .
as yet we have reached no plan to guard the books . probably the best we can do is to allow any passerby who is hit and hurt to keep the book . of course , the point naturally arises as to whether a passerby who has been hit with the second volume of [male] 's rome has a right to demand the whole set . we rather think there would be justice in that , at any rate . we are not disposed to be petty about the matter , because we realize that from the fifth floor even a single volume of [male] might be deadly .
now , for this reason , and for the further reason that it is a matter of immense importance that we guard against despotism . i oppose changing the personnel of the general conference without my annual conference has a right to vote upon it . and it is voted upon , despotism is a suitable term . a general conference may become a despot , and just as soon as it goes outside of its legitimate province . then it usurps , and so far as it usurps , it becomes despotic .
this is one reason i got a cat . my father talks a lot anyway , maybe being a lawyer he gets in the habit . also , he 's a small guy with very little gray curly hair . so maybe he thinks he 's got to roar a lot to make up for not being a big hairy tough guy . mom is thin and quiet , and when anything upsets her .
had [male] knocked at the door and asked for lady [male] he certainly would not have seen her . she was enduring at that moment , with almost silent obstinacy . the fierce anger of her indignant husband , she was sure that it would be bad for her to go to cross [female] at present . or anywhere among the germains , while such things were said of her as the marquis had said . could lord [male] have declared that the marquis was at war with the family as he had been at war some weeks since .
i do not like to interfere , replied doris , i am trying to figure out what it may mean . he may have the makings of a sculptor in him . but one could see that she was a little worried , so i did not say the cheap and obvious thing . that at any rate he had the makings of a sculpture in him or would have in a few more days of self expression . soft putty was put at his disposal , in case he might feel like doing a little modeling .
after breakfast we climbed the hill and visited the ancient castle of hirschhorn . and the ruined church near it , there were some curious old bas reliefs leaning against the inner walls of the church . sculptured lords of hirschhorn in complete armor . and ladies of hirschhorn in the picturesque court costumes of the middle ages . these things are suffering damage and passing to decay .
we are not about to follow up the correspondence of sir [male] by detailing the reply which harcourt sent . and all that thereupon ensued between them , we pass over , then , some months of time . and arrive at the late autumn , it is a calm , still morning . the sea , streaked with tinted shadows , is without a ripple . the ships of many nations that float on it are motionless .
altogether , the summer had been a severe one ; he doubted that he could have survived much more of it . and now that it was virtually over , at last , he was so resigned to the departure of his daughter 's lovely little friend that he felt no regret for the splurge with which her visit was closing . nay , to speed the parting guest -- such was his lavish mood . twice and thrice over would he have paid for the lights . the flowers , the music , the sandwiches .
with feverish energy he set to work with the shovel . treating the two stacks of coal and coke with entire impartiality . then , when he had filled the furnace , he closed the door with the air of the roman sentry relieving himself of responsibility by setting a burglar alarm . getting well out of the radius of the heat caused by the furnace . he composed himself to slumber behind the heap of coke .
the train travelled forth into the world , bearing along with it the customary freight of obliterated voyagers . and along with these old [male] , affecting immersion in his paper . and [male] slumbering over the columns of the pink un . and [male] revolving in his mind a dozen grudges . and suspicions , and alarms , it passed christchurch by the sea .
if he really loved her , he would listen to her . and believe her , if he did not -- why then let lady ball have her own way . she had promised to be firm , and she would keep her promise . but she would not intrigue with the hope of making him firm . if he was infirm of purpose .
the sides of the foundation were soon raised to a height and thickness of about five feet . for the materials were abundant , and the structure was intended to be sufficiently solid to last several days . the four walls were completed in eight hours ; an opening had been left on the southern side . and the canvas of the tent , placed on these four walls . fell over the opening and sheltered it , it only remained to cover the whole with large blocks .
on the 17th one of those majestic spectres of the deep , a water spout , stalked by them . and they trembled for their lives , young [male] set it down in his scanty journal with the judicious comment that `` it might have been a fine sight from a ship . '' it rained all night and all day , everybody uncomfortable . now came a sword fish chasing a [location] ; and the poor thing , seeking help and friends . took refuge under the rudder , the big sword fish kept hovering around .
but [male] remained stoutly in the doorway until the other man in brown had disappeared into flambeau 's . then he glanced momentarily at the golden dragon , puckered his mouth into a whistle of unconcern . and proceeded to wheel his machine into the road until a sufficient margin for mounting was secured . now , at that time , i say , [male] was rather desirous than not of seeing no more of the young lady in grey . the other man in brown he guessed was her brother .
as he is an excellent horseman , and understands farriery . i have bought a stout gelding for his use . that he may attend [location] on the road . and have an eye to our cattle , in case the coachman should not mind his business . my nephew , who is to ride his own saddle horse , has taken , upon trial .
with the storm came a change of weather . and the stronger the wind blew , and the wilder the rain lashed around . the colder and colder it got . pretty soon , various kinds of bugs and ants and worms and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside my armor to get warm . and while some of them behaved well enough , and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet .
aunt [female] owned the little brown cottage . where her widowed mother , she said . had lived , and there she died , as soon as she was laid in her grave . it was torn down , and the precious damson tree was felled , i was rather glad that the school house was so ugly . that i might have a double reason for hating the usurper .
i had a mind to let the poor fellow have his humour. . then [male] , said i , let me see it . la fleur instantly pulled out a little dirty pocket book cramm would full of small letters and billet doux in a sad condition . and laying it upon the table , and then untying the string which held them all together . run them over , one by one , till he came to the letter in question , la voila !
ten steps below that place stood a crowd of men . women , and comely young maidens waist deep in the water and they were scooping it up in their hands and drinking it . faith can certainly do wonders , and this is an instance of it . those people were not drinking that fearful stuff to assuage thirst , but in order to purify their souls and the interior of their bodies . according to their creed , the ganges water makes everything pure that it touches .
the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the donwell [female] estate . to which all the rest of highbury belonged ; but their fortune . from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell [male] itself . in every other kind of consequence ; and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr. [male] had first entered not two years ago . to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade .
presently the quiet colored girl returned , and in a low voice , and with a subdued well-trained manner . invited her visitor to follow her ; meekly obeying , he was led up two flights of respectable stairs into a room wherein there was nothing mysterious . nor was there anything particularly suggestive except a large glass case filled with a stock of perfumery . what was the propriety of so very many bottles filled with perfumes and medicines did not at first appear . but the assortment of imprisoned odors , and liquid drugs .
all that night he lay awake , thinking . it was a weary bundle of nerves that came to the parisian cafe next morning . he was late in arriving , which was good in that it delayed the inevitable question as to the fate of the picture . but bad in every other respect , [male] , squatting behind the cash desk . grunted fiercely at him ; and , worse , [male] , who , owing to his absence .
much else the colonel said , in particular did he aver that , provided the russian peasant could be induced to array himself in german costume . science would progress , trade increase . and the golden age dawn in [location] . for a while chichikov listened with distended eyes . then he felt constrained to intimate that with all that he had nothing to do .
it was through one of these batsmen that an accident occurred which had a good deal of influence on [male] 's affairs . [male] had strolled out by himself , half-way across the field [male] joined him . [male] was cheerful , and rather embarrassingly grateful , he was just in the middle of his harangue when the accident happened . the almost universal habit of batsmen of shouting `` heads ! '' at whatever height from the ground the ball may be .
[female] 's help was possibly well meant , but it was certainly inconvenient . his theories were of the brilliant , dashing order . and pillingshot could never be certain who and in what rank of life the next suspect would be . he spent that afternoon shadowing the greaser ( the combination of boot boy and butler who did the odd jobs about [organization] ) . and in the evening seemed likely to be about to move in the very highest circles .
that his nervous system was not wholly restored to health was borne in upon him as he walked along piccadilly on his way to his flat . for , when somebody suddenly slapped him hard between the shoulder blades . he uttered a stifled yell and leaped in the air . turning to face his assailant , he found himself meeting the genial gaze of mr. [male] . his predecessor in the ownership of the windsor theater .
coming from aunt [female] this was a marvelous concession . the young man bowed his head in pleased acknowledgment and . by and by , crossed his legs in comfort as a home-like feeling began to settle down upon him . suddenly observing their bloomered exposure , however , he tried to poke his legs under the couch . and twiddled his thumbs instead , `` and when do our young people expect to be married ? ''
definition of a good mother : one who loves her child almost as much as a little girl loves her doll . the way to hold a husband is to keep him a little bit jealous . the way to lose him is to keep him a little bit more jealous . women have simple tastes , they can get pleasure out of the conversation of children in arms and men in love . whenever a husband and wife begin to discuss their marriage they are giving evidence at a coroner 's inquest .
after that , he earnestly combed and brushed his hair , and retied his tie . next , he took from a drawer two clean handkerchiefs . he placed one in his breast pocket . part of the colored border of the handkerchief being left on exhibition . and with the other he carefully wiped his shoes , finally , he sawed it back and forth across them .
if they remain there we shall see little or nothing of each other . and it will be very uncomfortable , if they will settle themselves elsewhere . i will furnish a house for them . but i do not want to have them at my elbow , mr. [female] was of course bound to show this to lord [female] . and lord [female] was bound to consult lady [female] .
in a series of events , all of which had been a bit thick . this , in his opinion , achieved the maximum of thickness . it was the extreme ragged , outside edge of the limit . to brawl with a fellow man in a public street had been bad , but to be brawled with by a girl . the shot was not on the board , absolutely not on the board .
he was a hussar , a very tiny fellow . upon a big black horse , and it was his light weight which had brought him into the foremost place . it is a place of honour . but it is also a place of danger . as he was soon to learn , i felt the holsters , but , to my horror .
yet of the crowds that passed , not one attempted to enter by that gate . they plodded steadily on under a blazing sun to the other gate . at which a man stood to collect the entrance money . i have seen german youngsters stand longingly by the margin of a lonely sheet of ice . they could have skated on that ice for hours .
she drew it out and noticed that behind it was a black wooden chest which [organization] had sent over from italy years and years ago . before [female] was born , in fact , [female] had told her about it one day . how there was no key to it , because [organization] wished it to remain unopened until he returned home . and how this wandering uncle , who was a mighty hunter . had gone into [location] to hunt elephants and had never been heard from afterwards .
it was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination . of course nothing could be said in my defence . hanging was my inevitable fate , i resigned myself thereto with a feeling half stupid , half acrimonious . being little of a cynic , i had all the sentiments of a dog , the hangman . however , adjusted the noose about my neck , the drop fell , i forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows .
the eastern coast of greenland advances perpendicularly northward . the discoveries of the navigators have given the exact boundaries of those parts . in the extent of five hundred leagues , which separates greenland from spitzbergen . no land has been found , an island lay a hundred miles north of gaël hamkes bay . where the `` jeune hardie '' was wintering , if the norwegian schooner , as was most probable .
then , with a strange hoarse cry of baffled desire and revenge . she succeeded , by a violent effort , in turning , and bore down with tremendous force upon the cowering hairdresser . who gave himself up at once for lost , but the marble was already incapable of obeying her will . within a few paces from him the statue stopped for the last time . with an abruptness that left it quivering and rocking , a greyish hue came over the face .
he always liked to spread his meals out , to make them last longer . a drink of water to wash the food down . and he returned to the middle of the cage . where he proceeded to conduct a few intimate researches with his beak under his left wing . after which he mewed like a cat , and relapsed into silent meditation once more .
he knew that , if he would free himself . this utterly unreasonable feeling must be wrestled with and overcome ; that now , if ever . was the time to assert himself , and prove that he was anything but the raw youth he was conscious of appearing . he had merely to speak and act , too , in his ordinary everyday manner . to forget as far as possible the change that had affected his outer man .
i set down again , a shaking all over , and got out my pipe for a smoke . for the house was all as still as death now , and so the widow would not know . well , after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boom . boom -- boom -- twelve licks . and all still again -- stiller than ever , pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees .
there was an instant when freddie could have saved himself by planting a number ten shoe on muriel 's spine . but even in that crisis he bethought him that he hardly stood solid enough with the authorities to risk adding to his misdeeds the slaughter of his aunt 's favorite cat . and he executed a rapid swerve , the spared cat proceeded on her journey upstairs . while freddie , touching the staircase at intervals . went on down , having reached the bottom , he sat amid the occasional [location] .
nelly had subsided shyly into the depths of her big arm chair , somehow she felt a better and a more important girl since [female] had addressed her . most people felt like that after encountering jill 's uncle [male] . [male] had a manner , it was not precisely condescending . and yet it was not the manner of an equal , he treated you as an equal . true , but all the time you were conscious of the fact that it was extraordinarily good of him to do so .
as mrs mackenzie made no objection to this . [female] went downstairs , and when she came near the passage at the bottom . she heard the voices of people talking merrily in the parlour . as her hand was on the lock of the door . words from miss colza became very audible , `` now , mr rubb , be quiet . ''
it was during the geography hour . mr. [male] had asked [male] to define a watershed . [male] , who upon the previous evening had been too much occupied with his duties as vice-president of the anarchists to do much prep . had replied with a seraphic smile that a watershed was `` a place to shelter from the rain . '' as an improvised effort the answer seemed to him an extremely good one .
[female] in his outline of history seldom seems just an englishman . he fights his battles and makes most of his judgments alone and generally in defiance of the traditions of his countrymen . but he is not bold enough to face napoleon bonaparte all by himself , the sight of the terrible little corsican peeping over the edge of the thirty eighth chapter sends wells scurrying from his solitude into the center of a british square . it must be that when wells was little and bad his nurse told him that if he did not eat his mush or go to bed . or perform some other necessary function in the daily life of a child .
for days at a time he would not touch his records . that could mean but one thing , of course ; his work was done . yet he seemed to be making no move toward departure . not that she wanted him to go , she should miss him very much when he went , of course . but she did not like to feel that he was staying simply because he had nowhere to go and nothing to do .
no work on geography could be called complete without a description of these six countries . if the reader should ask me how i came to leave six such important countries to the last page . i should be compelled to change the subject , writing a little geography book is like packing a very small bag for a journey round the world . only instead of cramming it with shirts and shoes and collars and handkerchiefs and brushes . you stuff it full of countries .
thus perished one of the brightest , bravest and loftiest peers of england , a victim to the spleen . hate and tyranny of the ugly [female] . a woman without conscience or morality . when her personal interest was involved , she shines out as one of the greatest and most infamous queens of history . and so long as lofty crime is remembered she will remain on the top pedestal of royal iniquity .
say , he cried , ye ' r just a dummy . that 's wot ye are , and ran away to seek a more promising customer . this idea worried her a little , but she walked on to the corner . where she noticed a street car stop to let some people on . the wax lady , still determined to do as others did .
he rushed upstairs , two steps at a time . and , flinging open the door of a cupboard , began desperately to uncloak his aphrodite . she was lifeless still , which he considered fortunate . but the goddess seemed to have a natural propensity to retain any form of portable property . one of her arms was so placed that , tug and stretch as he would .
he was not at the station , nor did he arrive in the cart with my trunk . but i was resolved to risk nothing , i bought a ticket for [location] . and boarded the [location] train , it had been my intention to leave it at guildford and catch an afternoon train back to stanstead . but it seemed to me , on reflection . that this was unnecessary , there was no likelihood of sam making any move in the matter of the nugget until the following day .
and he let me lick out the saucepan in which the dinner had been cooked . after that , we got on fine , whenever i heard anyone at the window i just kept curled up and took no notice . and every time i got a bone or something good . it was easy , once you had got the hang of things . it was about a week after that the man took me out one morning .
but what chess player who has sat with an extended forefinger on the head of his queen for five minutes . before observing the enemy 's bishop in the distance and bringing back his piece to safety . what chess player , i say , will deny that the muscles of the hand ridge up like lumps of iron after a month at the best of games ? what chess player who has stretched his arm out in order to open with the ruy lopez gambit . who has then withdrawn it as the possibilities of the [male] quixote occur to him .
now there is no one circumstance in which the distempers of the mind bear a more exact analogy to those which are called bodily . than that aptness which both have to a relapse , this is plain in the violent diseases of ambition and avarice . i have known ambition , when cured at court by frequent disappointments ( which are the only physic for it ) . to break out again in a contest for foreman of the grand jury at an assizes . and have heard of a man who had so far conquered avarice , as to give away many a sixpence .
mr. [male] sat on for some minutes after his companion had left . pondering over the news he had heard , even now he clung to the idea that [male] had made some extraordinary mistake . gradually he began to convince himself of this , he had seen wyatt actually in bed a quarter of an hour before . not asleep , it was true , but apparently on the verge of dropping off . and the bars across the window had looked so solid ... could [male] have been dreaming ?
the female member of the party took advantage of his dumbness . which , as she had not unnaturally mistaken him for the butler . she took for a silent and respectful query as to her business and wishes . to open the conversation , fortunately he was in a position to do so . he knew all about what butlers did and what they said on these occasions .
cho , the god of day . the god of day , the park shall our sparkeion play . ha ha , etc , the rarest fun and rarest fare that ever fell to mortal share ha ha etc , nice . i am the moon , the lamp of night . i show a light -- i show a light , with radiant sheen i put to flight the shadows of the sky .
i knew her too well , i had no discoveries to make about her . her honest , simple soul had always been open to me to read . there was none of that curiosity , that sense of something beyond that makes for love . we had reached a point of comradeship beyond which neither of [location] desired to pass . yet at the fletchers ball i asked [female] to marry me .
she took her little ticket and she did not fail to stick it with half a dozen coppers in her glove . another moment found her with a plenty to astound her . for she would notice boards all round her , and above ! so she studied every number on those sign posts that encumber all the station . and she learned them one by one ; but she found the indication of the platforms of the station not much use as information when she would done .
but psmith was different , he could get on with anyone . he seemed to have the gift of entering into their minds and seeing things from their point of view . as regarded mr waller , [male] liked him personally . and was prepared , as we have seen , to undertake considerable risks in his defence . but he loathed with all his heart and soul the idea of supper at his house .
i can not tell , i may only speak of them now as i find them . which is in the garden or in the drawing room , in their lily leaved pool . sunk deep in the old flagged terrace , upon whose borders the blackbird whistles his early morning song . they remind me of sundials and lavender and old delightful things . but in their cheap glass bowl upon the three legged table .
the sun was crawling up the side of the mountains when person and dr. person swung out of the ranch yard between two armored scout cars for the sixty mile trip down the range road . dew glistened in the early rays of light and the clear . cool morning air held little hint of the heat sure to come by midmorning . there was a rush of photographers towards the gate as the little convoy left the ranch . a battery of cameras grabbed shots of the vehicles heading south .
and he will slop his name about to documents without ever looking to see what he 's doing . and be let in for lord knows what ; and another wife will turn up for him that he had married when a boy and forgotten all about . and the next corpse that comes to the village he will get mixed up with . sure to -- and have it laid to his door , and there will be all the old business over again . no , our advice to the stage heroine is to get rid of the hero as soon as possible .
such a reverse in man 's life awakens a better principle than curiosity . i could not help looking for some time at him as i sat in the remise . the more i look would at him , his croix . and his basket , the stronger they wove themselves into my brain. . i got out of the remise , and went towards him .
the wlgw was very severe ; our sleeping place could hardly be distinguee from the snow around it . which had fallen to a depth of a flirk during the past evening . and we heartily enjoyed a rough scramble en bas to the giesbach falls . where we soon found a warm climate , at noon the day before grindelwald the thermometer could not have stood at less than 100 degrees fahr . in the sun ; and in the evening , judging from the icicles formed .
to avoid a man for long is impossible , i had been avoiding [male] as long as i could . for i knew that he wanted to corner me with a view to a heart to heart talk on life insurance . these amateur life insurance agents are a curious band . the world is full of them , i have met them at country houses . at seaside hotels , on ships , everywhere ; and it has always amazed me that they should find the game worth the candle .
jonas received this compliment with anything but a good grace . perhaps because of his own private sentiments in reference to the personal appearance of his deceased parent . perhaps because he was not best pleased to find that montague and tigg were one . that gentleman perceived it , and tapping him familiarly on the sleeve . beckoned him to the window , from this moment .
i knew just what would happen , [female] and [female] , the lawyers . simply looked at me as if i had been caught snatching bags . at least , [male] did , and [male] would have done it . too , only he had been dead a good time , finally , after drinking me in for about a quarter of an hour . [male] said that if i desired to address a communication to his client .
before swift retired to [location] , mr. [male] . dr. [male] , mr . [male] . mr. [male] , mr. [male] . and swift formed themselves into a society called the scriblerus club . they wrote a good many things in conjunction .
comrade prebble backed the reluctant [female] into a corner . and , like the ancient mariner , held him with a glittering eye . psmith and mr waller . in the opposite corner , were looking at something with their heads close together . [male] definitely abandoned all hope of a rescue from psmith .
she took the candle from the table . and examined the reflection closely , she was sure she was just as pretty as miss [female] . it was only the clothes that made the difference . the clothes and the behaviour , [female] threw back her head . and smiled brilliantly , hand on hip , she nodded reassuringly at herself .
you know how it is when you get an idea . for awhile it sort of simmers inside you . and then suddenly it sizzles up like a rocket , and there you are . right up against it , that 's what happened now , i went away from that luncheon . vaguely determined to pull off some stunt which would prove that i was right there with the gray matter .
you note the crucial point of the mentioned agitation . the argument is that the christian can not compete with the jew . and that hence his very bread is in peril . to human beings this is a much more hate inspiring thing than is any detail connected with religion . with most people , of a necessity , bread and meat take first rank , religion second .
as the fair fille [female] chambre was so near my door . she returned back , and went into the room with me for a moment or two whilst i wrote a card . there is a sort of a pleasing half guilty blush . where the blood is more in fault than the man . 't is sent impetuous from the heart , and virtue flies after it .
the large , clean faced house wore , to his eyes , as the barouche drove up to it . a very friendly aspect ; the high , slender elms made lengthening shadows in front of it . the baroness descended ; her [location] [male] were stationed in the portico . [male] waved his hat to them . and a tall , lean gentleman , with a high forehead and a clean shaven face .
visit the paste and beat the pig alternately for some days . and ascertain if , at the end of that period , the whole is about to turn into gosky patties . if it does not then , it never will ; and in that case the pig may be let loose . and the whole process may be considered as finished , a was an ant who seldom stood still . and who made a nice house in the side of a hill .
this temperament of mine -- this good and evil that is in me . it shall grow with every age , spreading ever wider , combining , amalgamating , i go into my children and my children 's children . i am eternal , i am they . they are i , the tree person and you clear the ground . thankful if out of its dead limbs you can make good firewood .
the lovers were now alone , and it will , i question not . appear strange to many readers , that those who had so much to say to one another when danger and difficulty attended their conversation . and who seemed so eager to rush into each other 's arms when so many bars lay in their way . now that with safety they were at liberty to say or do whatever they pleased . should both remain for some time silent and motionless ; insomuch that a stranger of moderate sagacity might have well concluded they were mutually indifferent .
at last he felt himself set down on some hard , firm surface . and ventured to open his eyes once more , when he realised where he actually was . his knees gave way under him . and he was seized with a sudden giddiness that very nearly made him lose his balance . for he found himself standing on a sort of narrow ledge or cornice immediately under the ball at the top ofpaul 's .
strange to say , [female] was frightened to death when first called upon to speak a piece . he says he committed dozens of pieces to memory and recited them to the woods and crags and cows and stone abutments of the new england farms . but could not stand up before a school and utter a word . in 1801 he studied law with [male] . afterwards [location] senator .
to the careless eye the scene on the main street of a summer afternoon is one of deep and unbroken peace . the empty street sleeps in the sunshine . there is a horse and buggy tied to the hitching post in front of glover 's hardware store . there is , usually and commonly , the burly figure of mr. [male] . proprietor of [male] 's hotel .
17 , the turk plays with his left arm , a circumstance so remarkable can not be accidental . [male] takes no notice of it whatever beyond a mere statement . we believe , that such is the fact , the early writers of treatises on the automaton . seem not to have observed the matter at all , and have no reference to it . the author of the pamphlet alluded to by [male] .
one june evening , when the orchards were pink blossomed again . when the frogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the lake of shining waters . and the air was full of the savor of clover fields and balsamic fir woods . [female] was sitting by her gable window , she had been studying her lessons . but it had grown too dark to see the book , so she had fallen into wide-eyed reverie .
insomuch that they can eat you into poverty . without making their teeth bleed , o it is such a delight to see that they continually grow up so slovenly and wastfully in their cloaths . that they must needs have every half year almost a new suit . and that alwaies a little bigger ; whereby the father sees that he shall in short time have a son to be his man in the shop . and the mother a daughter to be her caretakester and controulster of the kitchin .
bye baby bunting . daddy 's gone a hunting on the stock exchange . to catch some one who is not his match ; if he has luck , as well as pluck . a coach he will very likely win to ride his baby bunting in . of this establishment how can we speak ? its cheese is mitey and its ale is weak .
the spring , long retarded by previous cold , had now begun in all its comeliness . and life was rampant , already , over the first emerald of the grass . the dandelion was showing yellow , and the red pink anemone was hanging its tender head . while the surface of every pond was a swarm of dancing gnats and midges . and the water spider was being joined in their pursuit by birds which gathered from every quarter to the vantage ground of the dry reeds .
and so it would have come if at that moment the word had been given and the whole army had been permitted to advance . we had but to fall upon them and to sweep them from the face of the earth . to put aside all question of courage , we were the more numerous . the older soldiers , and the better led , but the emperor desired to do all things in order . and he waited until the ground should be drier and harder , so that his artillery could manoeuvre .
a good deal more in the same strain gave the house team the comfortable feeling that they had done uncommonly well to get beaten by only twenty-four points . [male] fostered the delusion , and in the meantime arranged with mr [male] to collect fifteen innocents and lead them forth to be slaughtered by the house on the following friday . mr [male] entered into the thing with a relish . when he showed [male] the list of his team on the friday morning . that diplomatist chuckled , he foresaw a good time in the near future .
of course they landed safely at the foot of the cliff . after the manner of all heroes and heroines . and here it is that kate in her turn comes out strong . at the evening encampment , frying bacon over a blazing fire of pine branches . while the firelight illuminates her leather leggings and her rough but picturesque costume .
southern officers resigned daily from the army and navy to go home and join the fortunes of their several states . meantime , the federal government moved about like a baby elephant loaded with shot . while the new confederacy got men , money , arms . and munitions of war from every conceivable point . finding that supplies were to be sent to major person , general person summoned major person to surrender .
i heard his chains upon his legs , as he turned his body to lay his little stick upon the bundle. . he gave a deep sigh. -- i saw the iron enter into his soul ! i burst into tears. -- i could not sustain the picture of confinement which my fancy had drawn. . i started up from my chair , and calling la fleur . i bid him bespeak me a remise .
the reader will see by this that a deaf and dumb asylum in [location] was about the only safe place for a peaceable man at that time . president [male] found himself placed at the head of a looted government on the sharp edge of a crisis that had not been properly upholstered . the buchanan cabinet had left little except a burglar 's tool or two here and there to mark its operations . and , with the aged and infirm general [male] at the head of a little army . and no encouragement except from the abolitionists , many of whom had never seen a colored man outside of a minstrel performance .
a pretty hot idea for a non thinker like dear old bobbie . we sallied out at once , he took half and i took half . and we settled down to work , as i say , it sounded good , but when we came to go into the thing . we saw that there was a flaw , there was plenty of information all right . but there was not a single month that did not have something that exactly hit off [female] .
he left just one heavily shaded bronze lamp abeam . then he carefully drew all the curtains across the windows and tiptoed about the room with the air of a sinister conspirator . he stopped in front of the great , mysterious looking chest to one side of the entrance to the hallway . lifted the heavy lid and looked in , `` here 's where we will put our dead , '' he said , with a lugubrious grin , let down the lid softly and crossed abruptly to the roomiest and coziest chair beside the curtained window .
it is not even arbitrament by everybody , it can be more nearly defined as arbitrament by anybody . i mean that it rests on that club habit of taking a total stranger for granted . of assuming certain things to be inevitably common to yourself and him , only the things that anybody may be presumed to hold have the full authority of democracy . look out of the window and notice the first man who walks by . the liberals may have swept england with an over whelming majority .
[female] and the headmaster both looked at the speaker . [female] with a feeling of relief . for stout denial , unsupported by any weighty evidence . is a wearing game to play -- the headmaster with astonishment . he sat there , with a curious feeling of having swallowed a heavy weight .
i will add that he also left with me a second sealed envelope entitled `` last will and testament , '' but instructed me not to open such envelope until two years from the date written thereon . the period of six months has now expired , i have opened the envelope entitled `` terms of trust , '' and find that i am directed to convert the securities into cash with all convenient speed . and forthwith to pay over one third of the net proceeds to his [location] , [male] .
this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection . this was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry . which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it. -- she was most sorrowfully indignant . ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for mr . knightley. -- every other part of her mind was disgusting .
these facts are all on the credit side of the proposition that the jew is a good and orderly citizen . summed up , they certify that he is quiet , peaceable , industrious , unaddicted to high crimes and brutal dispositions . that his family life is commendable ; that he is not a burden upon public charities . that he is not a beggar ; that in benevolence he is above the reach of competition . these are the very quintessentials of good citizenship , if you can add that he is as honest as the average of his neighbours .
it was not a tempting looking cheese , it was an unhealthy , sad looking cheese . it looked like a cheese that had seen trouble . in appearance it resembled putty more than anything else . it even tasted like putty -- at least , like i should imagine putty would taste . to this hour i am not positive that it was not putty .
by the governor 's command , [male] was now allowed every indulgence he might ask for which could interest his mind and soften the hardships of his imprisonment . his wife and child spent the days with him . i was his companion by night . he was removed from the narrow cell which he had occupied during such a dreary stretch of time . and given the chief warden 's roomy and comfortable quarters .
mr. [male] fingered his book absently for a while . then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read ! [male] a glance at becky . he had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did . with a gun levelled at its head , instantly he forgot his quarrel with her .
the offices of messrs nichols . nichols , nichols , and nichols were in [male] 's inn fields . the first nichols had been dead since the reign of king [male] the fourth . the second since the jubilee year of queen victoria . the remaining brace were lord [male] 's friend [male] and his father .
gaily you shake hands with him and straighten your tie . forgotten is the fact that you have another appointment with him for monday . there is no such thing as monday , you are through for today . and all 's right with the world , as you pass out through the waiting room . you leer at the others unpleasantly , the poor fishes !
anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could . she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath . a little raised on one side of the lane , leaving them together in the main road . but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriet 's habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too . and that , in short , they would both be soon after her , this would not do .
i wish i could think what he is going to teach us . can it be deportment ? but he experimented in that at newport and failed to give satisfaction . except to a few , those few are pleased , they are enjoying their joy as well as they can . they confess their happiness to the interviewer . they feel pretty striped , but they remember with reverent recognition that they had sugar between the cuts .
wherever i have looked there are animals , listen . there is an indian prince , he has with him two dromedaries . there is also one other indian prince , with him is a giraffe . the giraffe drink every day one dozen best champagne to keep his coat good . i , the artist , have my bock .
that was it -- there was no doubt , the diamond in the arms of his slaves was some advance sample . a promise of more to follow , that , [male] perceived after a time . was the thread running through his sentences , prometheus enriched was calling to witness forgotten sacrifices . forgotten rituals , prayers obsolete before the birth of [male] . for a while his discourse took the farm of reminding god of this gift or that which divinity had deigned to accept from men .
during the publication of the drapers letters . swift was particularly careful to conceal himself from being known as the author . the only persons in the secret , were [male] , his butler . whom he employed as an amanuensis , and dr. [male] . it happened , that on the very evening before the proclamation , offering a reward of £300 for discovering the author of these letters .
we went to see for ourselves , at a distance of half a day 's automobile run from [location] we found an establishment answering to the plans and specifications . it was shoved jam up against the road . as is the french custom ; and it was surrounded by a high , broken wall . on which all manner of excrescences in the shape of tiny dormers and misshapen little towers hung . like [location] ticks on the ears of a quarantined steer .
she seemed to say , cheer up , -- as long as we are here . let [location] make the best of it , i judged she had earned a right to a more hospitable place . so i plucked her up and sent her to [location] to a friend who would respect her for the fight she had made . all by her small self , to make a whole vast despondent alpine desolation stop breaking its heart over the unalterable . and hold up its head and look at the bright side of things for once .
when we arrived at the town where we were to breakfast . i was determined to speak with philander and gustavus . and to that purpose as soon as i left the carriage . i went to the basket and tenderly enquired after their health , expressing my fears of the uneasiness of their situation . at first they seemed rather confused at my appearance dreading no doubt that i might call them to account for the money which our grandfather had left me and which they had unjustly deprived me of .
it was [location] , completely enclosed by the barren mountains which towered above it . at one end a waterfall hung on the face of a cliff . a misty thread pouring into a rainbow arched pool , a brook serpentined through fields and groves of trees . there were flocks of sheep and goats in the fields . here and there were strange ruins of marble and red granite .
disgusted as i was with my master 's villanies . and eager to obey the lieutenant 's orders . i made no hesitation to seize my own master and pull him down to the ground . where i would have torn him to pieces if the thief takers had not with great difficulty separated us . they wanted to punish me , and even to beat me to death with sticks .
it took them three days to get the roof thoroughly off . and all they found was a bird 's nest ; after securing which they covered up the house with tarpaulins . to keep it dry , he said there must be something in it all . or the ghost would never keep on coming as it did ; and that , having gone so far . he would go on to the end , and solve the mystery .
so the king told [location] to both stay on watch till the weather got better . then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night . it was my watch below till twelve . but i would not a turned in anyway if i would had a bed , because a body do not see such a storm as that every day in the week . not by a long sight , my souls , how the wind did scream along !
on june 28 an attack was made by the english on fort moultrie . it was built of palmetto logs . which are said to be the best thing in the world to shoot into if one wishes to recover the balls and use them again . palmetto logs accept and retain balls for many years . and are therefore good for forts , when the fleet got close enough to the fort so that the brave charlestonians could see the expression on the admiral 's face .
besides displaying that beauty of virtue which may attract the admiration of mankind . i have attempted to engage a stronger motive to human action in her favour . by convincing men , that their true interest directs them to a pursuit of her . for this purpose i have shown that no acquisitions of guilt can compensate the loss of that solid inward comfort of mind . which is the sure companion of innocence and virtue .
Miss [female] by [female] at [organization] miss [female] might have been forty . and she had taken advantage of this opportunity by being just a year or two older . her face was of high vivid colour and was corrugated by chronic rage and curiosity . but these vivifying emotions had preserved to her an astonishing activity of mind and body . which fully accounted for the comparative adolescence with which she would have been credited anywhere except in the charming little town which she had inhabited so long .
we have our doubts whether men who overreach others in this way . are really gainers in the end , they get to be known . and are dealt with by the wary as sharpers , a certain manufacturer -- we will not say of what place . for , our story being substantially true , to particularize in this respect would be almost like pointing out the parties concerned . was obliged to use a kind of goods imported only by two or three houses .
we were stout , pompous looking gentlemen , the majority of us . in frock coats and silk hats . the sergeant was a man with a sense of the fitness of things . the idea of shouting and swearing at [location] fell from him . and that gone there seemed to be no happy medium left to him , the stiffness departed from his back .
after that hope died , had it not been for her unceasing care the last spark would have gone long before . every morning she shaved and bathed him . shifted him with her own hands from bed to chair and back to bed . she was in his room constantly , bearing medicine . straightening a pillow , talking to him almost as one talks to a nearly human dog .
squiffy put on a dressing gown and disappeared , archie looked under the bed . from the trousers the head of [female] popped up with its usual expression of amiable enquiry . archie nodded pleasantly , and sat down on the bed , the problem of his little friend 's immediate future wanted thinking over . from within , through the open transom , came the rhythmical snoring of a good man taking his rest after the labours of the day . mr. [male] was always a heavy sleeper .
it is merely a few impressions of pvt . [male] , buck , placed in a situation so new . so incomparable , that it had wiser men than he guessing . he was one of those who left their reasons for being `` there '' to be analyzed by men not so occupied in the business of keeping alive . he would have been bored to death if you had tried to explain them to him anyway .
he walked to the door , gave her another bow . and left the room , and [male] gladys could see that he was laughing to himself as if very much amused . when the door had closed behind the queer little man the child sat down in the window again and glanced at the book . it had a red and yellow cover and the word `` thingamajigs '' was across the front in big letters . then she opened it , curiously , and saw her name written in black letters upon the first white leaf .
i was a good swimmer , i reached the ridge on the opposite side of the bay without fatigue . not changing from a powerful breast-stroke , i then sat for a while at the water 's edge to rest and to drink in the thrilling glory of what my heart persisted in telling me was the morning of my life . not distinctly , for he was rowing a dinghy in my direction . and consequently had his back to me , i turned upon my back for a moment 's rest . and , as i did so , heard a cry , i resumed my former attitude .
as the play progressed rutherford was amazed at the completeness of the character he had built , it lived . [male] in the magazine story might have been anyone . he fitted into the story , but you could not see him . he had no real individuality , but [male] in the play ! he felt that he would recognize him in the street .
my lady sent down word that she did not want to see mrs. [female] . these messages had to be filtered through the courier , who was specially odious to mrs. [male] . his lordship was almost as closely secluded as her ladyship , he did . indeed , go out to the stables , wrapped up in furs , and found fault with everything he saw there . and he had himself driven round the park .
she moved about the room , trying to make everyone feel at home . and succeeding only in emphasising the fact that they were all out , everybody was anxious to get down to the serious business of the evening . still the social amenities had to be observed , there must be a preliminary period devoted to conversation . after a quarter of an hour 's endeavour to exchange the ideas which none of them possessed . mrs. [female] moved over to mr. [male] and whispered something .
in fact -- he concluded -- it is not worth worrying over what 's evil and what is not . good and evil are not any standard to me . and they can be a devil of a bad hindrance when i want something . when i want something bad enough , common sense tells me to go and take it . and not get caught , and then suddenly dalyrimple knew what he wanted first , he wanted fifteen dollar to pay his overdue board bill .
`` that 's about as good as a dead'un , '' said [male] , as he landed a yard or two to the right . this was ill natured , and the horse in truth was not hurt , but a rider . at any rate a young rider , should not take a lead from a huntsman unless he is very sure of himself . of his horse , and of the run of the hounds . the next man over was the gentleman in black , who took it in a stand .
from the hotel we could view the huge glacier at very close range . after a rest we followed down a path which had been made in the steep inner frontage of the moraine . and stepped upon the glacier itself , one of the shows of the place was a tunnel like cavern . which had been hewn in the glacier , the proprietor of this tunnel took candles and conducted [location] into it . it was three or four feet wide and about six feet high .
nothing is now left which by any flattery can be called food . but they must manage somehow for five days more . for at noon they have still eight hundred miles to go . it is a race for life now . this is no time for comments or other interruptions from me .
phoebe and i helped that man to escape . and i have kept his secret , and pretended that i was his dearly loving sister . and done everything i could think of to make folk believe i was his loving sister . and this is his gratitude , before i pretend to be sister to anybody again . i will turn nun , and be sister to everybody -- one as much as another !
the reason why the reformers were discontented and wanted some changes made . seemed quite clear , in [location] it was claimed that the uitlanders paid thirteen fifteenths of the transvaal taxes . yet got little or nothing for it , their city had no charter . it had no municipal government ; it could levy no taxes for drainage . water supply , paving , cleaning , sanitation , policing .
perhaps , in his position , it would be too much to expect such a thing and . at all events , it never even occurred to him to attempt it . he consumed himself instead with inward raging and chafing at his hard lot . and his utter powerlessness to break the spell which bound him . sometimes , indeed , he would resolve to bear it no longer , and would start up impulsively to impart his misfortunes to some one in minor authority .
in the mere sensuous arts of painting and sculpture the germans are poor . in the ennobling arts of literature and music they are great . and this fact provides a key to their character . they are a simple , earnest , homely , genuine people , they do not laugh much . but when they do , they laugh deep down , they are slow .
[female] began to feel that the conversation was too deep for him . after opening in the conventional `` judge then placed the black cap on his head '' manner , his assailant had suddenly begun to babble lightly of sporting literature . he began to entertain doubts of the headmaster 's sanity . it would not have added greatly to his mystification if the head had gone on to insist that he was the emperor of [location] . and worked solely by electricity , the headmaster , for his part .
the hillside flickered before his eyes for an instant . and he clutched at the sandstone rock to steady himself . then his brain cleared , and he found himself thinking swiftly . he could not let her go like this , he must overtake her . he must stop her , he must speak to her .
n.b. -- please be careful not to inclose this circular in your letter to the president . no doubt the photograph habit . when once formed , is one of the most baneful , and productive of the most intense suffering in after years . of any with which we are familiar , some times it seems to me that my whole life has been one long . abject apology for photographs that i have shed abroad throughout a distracted country .
there can be no doubt , as we have before observed , and as we will presently endeavor to show . that the principle , or rather the result , of this solution is the true one . some person is concealed in the box during the whole time of exhibiting the interior . we object , however , to the whole verbose description of the manner in which the partitions are shifted . to accommodate the movements of the person concealed , we object to it as a mere theory assumed in the first place .
[female] , who played the guitar and piano very well . gave music lessons , and so helped the family fund . [female] , the original of cousin [female] . in [female] , was a sweet and noble girl . [female] was too young to work , but [female] was apprenticed to a printer named ament .
there was an old man of vesuvius , who studied the works of [male] . when the flames burnt his book , to drinking he took . that morbid old man of vesuvius . there was an old man of cape horn . who wished he had never been born ; so he sat on a chair .
[female] back , the carriage stopped at the rectory . she got out to call for miss [female] , so the emersons had gone . and all this bother about [female] had been unnecessary , waste ! that word seemed to sum up the whole of life . wasted plans , wasted money , wasted love . and she had wounded her mother , was it possible that she had muddled things away , quite possible .
so the fat man must stick to sober navy blues and depressing blacks and melancholy grays . he is advised that he should wear his evening clothes whenever possible . because black and white lines are more becoming to him , but even in evening clothes . that wide expanse of glazed shirt and those white enamel studs will put the onlookers in mind of the front end of a dairy lunch or so i have been cruelly told . when planning public utilities , who thinks of a fat man ? there never was a hansom cab made that would hold a fat man comfortably unless he left the doors open .
yes , in the dim brain of the jellied fish that is and is not living . moved and stirred from the beginning a mysterious wish , a vision , a command . a fatal word : the name of man was uttered . and they heard , upward along the aons of old war they sought him . wing and shank bone , claw and bill .
most of all do these principles hold true in such manly out of door enterprises as the forest and timber business . where one deals constantly with chief rangers , and pathfinders . and wood stalkers , whose very names seem to suggest a horn of whiskey under a hemlock tree . but -- let it be repeated and carefully understood -- there was no excess about mr. rasselyer brown 's drinking . indeed , whatever he might be compelled to take during the day , and at the mausoleum club in the evening .
saunders was setting up the net when they arrived . [male] put on his pads and went to the wickets . while marjory and the dogs retired as usual to the far hedge to retrieve . she was kept busy , saunders was a good sound bowler of the m.c.c . minor match type , and there had been a time when he had worried [male] considerably .
but the mule refused to be warned , he neatly escaped the donkey cart himself . but he crashed the caravan into it with such force that the caravan broke a shaft and overturned completely on to the donkey cart . scattering pots and pans far and wide , from within the caravan came inhuman female yells of fear and anger . [male] had fallen on to a soft bank of grass . he was discovering , to his amazement , that he was still alive and practically unhurt .
`` monsieur a demande le petit pain , '' the girl replied , astonished at his astonishment , with great presence of mind he accepted the situation . took in the bread , and did without his bath , the member says that . coming upon him suddenly amid the silence of the snow . he heard him practising the slightly different sounds of pain and bain .
his was the age of lavish expenditure , of magnificent structures . grand festivals , superb dress and equipage . aristocratic arrogance , brilliant campaigns , and great victories . it was , moreover , particularly distinguished for the number and high character of the various special embassies sent to the court of [male] by foreign powers . among these , [location] , the netherlands , [location] , and [location] rivaled each other in extravagant display and pomp .
you were not in love with me yesterday . you are not now , you would get out of it if you honorably could . but you honorably can not , so you have spoken to [female] . you are going to see it through , because you are a good sport ... i admire you for that , rex , too much to hold you to it .
now we can sit down and talk things over like friends . the sick man -- i do not mind talking , but remember i know you are not death . you are just some trick my hot head 's playing on me . do not get the idea you are putting anything over . the sick man -- you are open and above board .
it seemed to [male] that he had received an excuse for a remark of a kind that had been waiting for utterance ever since he had met her . often and often in the watches of the night , smoking endless pipes and thinking of her . he had conjured up just such a vision as this -- they two walking the deserted deck alone . and she innocently giving him an opening for some low voiced . tender speech , at which she would start .
i told him that he understood it as well as i did . at all events ; that i could not conceive why i should get into these difficulties . one after the other ; but that i believed i was a crazy man on this one subject , matrimonial monomania . that when i had gone through with one of these scrapes , and had suffered the severe punishment that was almost certain to follow . the whole was like a dream to me .
the next moment the dreams had come true , the umpire was signalling to the scoring box . the school was shouting , extra cover was trotting to the boundary to fetch the ball . and [female] was blushing and wondering whether it was bad form to grin . from that ball onwards all was for the best in this best of all possible worlds . saunders bowled no more half volleys ; but [male] played everything that he did bowl .
chorus , leaves in autumn fade and fall . winter is the end of all , spring and summer teem with glee . spring and summer , then , for me , fa la , person . in the spring time seed is sown : in the summer grass is mown . in the autumn you may reap : winter is the time for sleep , chorus .
to the right of mr. [male] i see a figure which . foreshortened from my point of view , is chiefly distinguishable by a hat and pair of boots . without absolute quaker fashion about the cut of the hat or garments . there is a breadth about the former and a looseness about the latter suggestive of quaker associations . perhaps if my idea were mercilessly analysed it would appear that it has its growth in the knowledge that i am looking down on mr .
i told the king to give his heels wings . and i would explain later , we made good time across the open ground . and as we darted into the shelter of the wood i glanced back and saw a mob of excited peasants swarm into view . with [male] and his wife at their head . they were making a world of noise .
and this was the end of the seven young cats , the seven young fishes swam across the lake pipple popple . and into the river , and into the ocean ; where , most unhappily for them . they saw , on the fifteenth day of their travels . a bright blue boss woss , and instantly swam after him . but the blue boss woss plunged into a perpendicular , spicular , orbicular , quadrangular , circular depth of soft mud .
she had only pointed out that as i could do nothing towards supporting eva i had better keep away when my cousin was in [location] . that was many years ago , since then we had seldom met , latterly , not at all . invitations still arrived from her , but her afternoon parties clashed with my after breakfast pipe . and as for her evening receptions -- well , by the time i had pieced together the various component parts of my dress clothes . i found myself ready for bed .
mr [organization] was a happy enough young man . he would have been happier if he had had more money and less uncle . one hundred and twenty pounds a year was all his store . but his uncle , mr [male] bloomfield . supplemented this with a handsome allowance and a great deal of advice .
`` you really do think it 's a good thing ? '' [male] ventured , for he had not yet been convinced of the entire goodness of theatrical enterprise near piccadilly circus , mr . seven [male] convinced him -- not by argument but by the sincerity of his gestures and tones . for it was impossible to question that mr , seven [male] knew what he was talking about . the shape of mr , seven [male] 's chin was alone enough to prove that mr. [male] was incapable of a mere ignorant effervescence .
lastly , compulsory games at school have bred in him an almost passionate desire to keep himself physically fit at all times in after life . he has grave faults , loving tradition . he dislikes change , and often stands mulishly in the way of necessary progress . mistrusting precocity , he often snubs genuine and valuable enthusiasm . his anxiety to mind only his own business sometimes leads him into deciding that some urgent matter does not concern him when in point of fact it does .
as a duellist he had acquired who had fallen at his hands . but they were many , he was a man of courage undoubtedly . but it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the duello . and the nicety of his sense of honor . that he most especially prided himself , these things were a hobby which he rode to the death .
the fort is a huge old structure , and has had a large experience in religions . in its great court stands a monolith which was placed there more than 2,000 years ago to preach by its pious inscription . the fort was built three centuries ago by a mohammedan emperor . a resanctification of the place in the interest of that religion . there is a hindoo temple , too , with subterranean ramifications stocked with shrines and idols .
the sight of [female] , however , roused mrs. [female] from her literary calm . to her eye , after what lord wisbeach had revealed there was something sinister in the very way in which he walked into the room . he made her flesh creep . in `` a society thug '' ( mobbs and stifien . dollar 1.35 net , all rights of translation reserved .
the whole mass of the coppers carried only amounts perhaps to twenty five cents in honest canadian money . but the silly system of the french currency makes the case appear worse than it is . and gives one the impression of being a walking treasury , morning , noon . and night the visitor is perpetually putting his hand into his side pocket and pulling out coppers . he drips coppers all day in an unending stream .
w was a watch of gold . it told the time of day . so that papa knew when to come , and when to go away , x was king xerxes . whom papa much wished to know ; but this he could not do , because xerxes died long ago . you was a youth , who kicked and screamed and cried like mad .
they asked , `` did you do so and so ? '' and she always said yes . and looked weary and tired , and took no interest in it , and so when the other ten heard that this one confessed . they confessed , too , and answered yes to the questions . then they were burned at the stake all together , which was just and right . and everybody went from all the countryside to see it .
jim he grumbled a little , but give in , he said we must not talk any more than we could help . and then talk mighty low , the lightning showed [location] the wreck again just in time . and we fetched the stabboard [male] . and made fast there , the deck was high out here , we went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard . in the dark , towards the [location] , feeling our way slow with our feet .
then there is the question of cast , the author builds his hero in such a manner that he requires an actor who can sing . dance , be funny , and carry a love interest , when the time comes to cast the piece . he finds that the only possible man in sight wants fifteen hundred a week and . anyway , is signed up for the next five years with the rival syndicate , he is then faced with the alternative of revising his play to suit either . a [male] , who can sing and dance , but is not funny ; b smith .
without boasting , i think i may say i am not afraid to stand before a modern french duelist . but as long as i keep in my right mind i will never consent to stand behind one again . one day we took the train and went down to [location] to see `` king lear '' played in german , it was a mistake , we sat in our seats three whole hours and never understood anything but the thunder and lightning . and even that was reversed to suit german ideas , for the thunder came first and the lightning followed after .
mom puts it on the line , all right . it does not make me feel any better about cat . she takes five dollar out of her pocketbook and gives it to me . i get out the wicker hamper and go down to the cellar and load cat in . he meows , a low resentful rumble .
they knew , for example , that mr. [male] 's favourite imposition was the greek numerals . and that in nine cases out of ten that would be what the youth who had dealings with him would need to ask for from the lines trust . mr. [male] , on the other hand . invariably set [male] , the oldest inhabitant had never known him to depart from this custom . for the french masters extracts from the works of victor [male] would probably pass muster .
the walls were gray , the woodwork white , the rug a serene blue . and very much like mahogany was the furniture -- the bureau with its great clear mirror . mrs. [female] 's dressing table with toilet articles of almost solid silver . the plain twin beds . between them a small table holding a standard electric bedside lamp .
the proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty . some peculiarities , either in his early education , or in the nature of his intellect . had tinged with what is termed materialism the whole cast of his ethical speculations ; and it was this bias . perhaps , which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most advantageous , if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise of the poetic sentiment . was to be found in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness .
arriving at the crown tavern , in oxford , we were . as usual , received by the old boniface devanant and his handsome wife . with warm words and luxurious table cheer , after a day and night of reasonable revelry . we proceeded on our way to [location] . and in due course found our sunny lodgings at the home of maggie mellow .
i used that argument myself upon the conference floor in 1868 . that the general conference could , without any other process , by mere legislation . introduce the laity into this body , i claimed there and then that . according to that decision , the methodist episcopal church was in the general conference . the general conference refused to accept that endorsement of that court .
there 's no point in going into all the gory details . finally two guys haul [location] apart , i have hold of [location] 's shirt and it rips , good . he 's half crying , and he twists away from the guy that grabbed him and screams some things at me before darting across the avenue . i am standing panting and sobbing . and the guy holding me says , you oughta be ashamed .
for a second bindle tore his gaze from the drama before him . he caught sight of several inches of white leg above a pair of elastic sided boots . out of which dangled black and orange tabs , `` help , [male] , help ! '' mr. [male] screamed in his terror and . a second later , he crashed against the gate on which bindle had climbed ready to haul him over .
mrs. [female] 's horse was going very strong with her . more than once the farmer cautioned her to give him a pull over the plough . and she attempted to obey the order , but the horse was self willed . and she was light ; and in truth the heaviness of the ground would have been nothing to him had he been fairly well ridden . but she allowed him to rush with her through the mud .
sequel : before noon , next day . he was safe in the city lockup . booked for three months , this second tedious captivity drew to an end in the course of time . and again a great crowd of sympathizing fellow students gave him a rousing reception as he came forth . but his delight in his freedom was so boundless that he could not proceed soberly and calmly .
silence fell , broken only by the snoring of smith . [female] was thinking of [female] , and of what [female] had said to her in the lane yesterday . of his clean cut face , and the look in his eyes . so vastly superior to any look that ever came into the eyes of bream mortimer . she was telling herself that her relations with [female] were an idyll .
poor little ruth was seized with a palpitation of the heart when [female] committed this appalling indiscretion . for she felt that if the dish turned out a failure . she never would be able to hold up her head before [female] westlock again . quite unconscious of her state of mind , [female] accepted the invitation with all imaginable heartiness . and after a little more pleasantry concerning this same pudding , and the tremendous expectations he made believe to entertain of it .
it made her nervous when she noticed one day that he carried in his right hand the ghost of the pistol with which he had shot himself . agreeably he abandoned his century old habit . but later he was able to give more convincing proof of his regard for frances . she was alone in the tall villa when her husband 's vulgar friend . [male] , called , he came to tell her that her husband was behaving disgracefully in south america .
and when they reachedalbans , there would be that wretched couple , kissing under the abbey walls . then these folks would go and be pirates until the marriage was over . from picnic point to old windsor lock is a delightful bit of the river . a shady road , dotted here and there with dainty little cottages , runs by the bank up to the `` bells of ouseley , '' a picturesque inn , as most up river inns are .
the elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated , and it was at once conceded by all observers . that its path , at perihelion , would bring it into very close proximity with the earth . there were two or three astronomers , of secondary note , who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable . i can not very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people . for a few short days they would not believe an assertion which their intellect so long employed among worldly considerations could not in any manner grasp .
but after i had been splashing about in the porcelain for a bit . composure began to return , i have always found that in moments of heart bowed downness there is nothing that calms the bruised spirit like a good go at the soap and water . i do not say i actually sang in the tub , but there were times when it was a mere spin of the coin whether i would do so or not . the spiritual anguish induced by that tactless speech had become noticeably lessened . the discovery of a toy duck in the soap dish .
in appearance he was a striking , handsome man . with a strong individuality , a good head , piercing eye . well shaped nose , and tall , active frame no doubt added to his authority in [location] . he struck me as a man who had been taken to pieces on his way home to this country . and put together again badly , for his joints were all wrong , certainly his head was .
that the soup should be cold , everybody no doubt expected . it was clear soup , made chiefly of marsala . and purchased from the pastry cook 's in store street . grandairs , no doubt , knew all about it . as he was connected with the same establishment , the fish .
the driver crossed himself and whispered , `` he 's foriver a sayin '' that , an be the powers , i belave him . sometimes ye would think that the howly saints thimselves was a sphak in whin that bye gits to goin on that way . it was wonderful , budge 's countenance seemed too pure to be of the earth as he continued to express his ideas of the better land and its denizens .
her face was grim and her walk was determined , as she made her way to the yard at which bindle was employed . there she demanded to see the manager and , after some difficulty , was admitted . she began by reproaching him and ordering him to stop the strike . when , however , he had explained that the strike was entirely due to the action of the men . she ended by telling him of her own drastic action .
he was still to be seen occasionally on the links , but now -- and i know of nothing more tragic that can befall a man . he found himself gradually shunned , he who in the days of his sanity had been besieged with more offers of games than he could manage to accept . men simply would not stand his incessant flow of talk . one by one they dropped off , until the only person he could find to go round with him was old major moseby . whose hearing completely petered out as long ago as the year 98 , and , of course .
if the bird fancier had been at home , as he ought to have been . there would have been no great harm in this ; but he was out , and his shop was closed . the shutters were down certainly ; and in every pane of glass there was at least one tiny bird in a tiny bird cage . twittering and hopping his little ballet of despair , and knocking his head against the roof . while one unhappy goldfinch who lived outside a red villa with his name on the door .
i told her she need not work any for me . but she is a dretful handy little thing about the house , or outdoors . when josiah was sick , and when the hired man happened to be away , she would go right out to the barn . and fodder the cattle jest as well as a man could , and josiah said she milked faster than he could . to save his life , her father had nine girls and no boys .
my own idea would be to send a class of men to these islands so thoroughly imbued with their great object and the oil of tobacco that the great caucasian chowder of those regions would be followed by such weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and such remorse and repentance and gastric upheavals that it would be as unsafe to eat a missionary in the cannibal islands as it is to eat ice-cream in [location] today . the excitement consequent upon the anticipated departure of mr. [male] for the north pole has recently awakened in the bosom of the [location] people a new interest in what i may term that great terra incognita . if i may be pardoned for using a phrase from my own mother tongue . let [location] for a moment look back across the bleak waste of years and see what wonderful progress has been made in the discovery of the pole . we may then ask ourselves , who will be first to tack his location notice on the gnawed and season cracked surface of the pole itself .
i must have been very weak at the time ; because i know . after the first half hour or so , i seemed to take no interest whatever in my food—an unusual thing for me—and i didn t want any cheese , this duty done . we refilled our glasses , lit our pipes . and resumed the discussion upon our state of health .
mind you , i do not believe in criticising a sermon . i always feel it a sacred obligation never to offer a word of criticism . when i say that the sermon was punk . i do not say it as criticism , i merely state it as a fact . and to think that we pay that man eighteen hundred dollar a year !
as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string . she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air , the tittering rose higher and higher . the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher 's head . down , down , a little lower , and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws . clung to it , and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession !
raoul , instead of slowly raising the curtain , tears it apart with a superb gesture and finds himself confronting valentine , at last ! it is the grand duet , and it starts off allegro vivace . raoul does not wait for valentine 's pleading . and valentine does not wait for raoul 's responses . the alarum is heard ; the bell resounds ; but what a panting bell !
in answer to the inquiries of dennis . he informed that gentleman that the police clerks were associated justices . that the prisoner 's cage was the jury box . and pointed out the prisoners themselves as the jury . the humble member of the police , who is known as the doorman .
ann walked on to her compartment , she felt as if she had just read a whole long novel . one of those chunky younger english novelist things , she knew the whole story as well as if it had been told to her in detail . she could see the father , the honest steady butler . living his life with but one aim , to make a gentleman of his beloved only son . year by year he had saved .
so i really missed the whole thing , the assistants had gone , and the dentist was mixing up cement and humming airs from light opera just like old times . it made the world seem a bright place . i went home with no teeth , i only meant them to remove one . but i realized that they had taken them all out , still it did not matter . not long after i received my bill , i was astounded at the nerve of it !
well sir , she just looked at me for a moment . and then she burst out crying and ran away from the table , but when i went after her and asked her what was the matter . she stopped crying and was mad in a minute all the way through . called me a heartless , cruel cannibal . that seemed to relieve her so that she got over her mad and began to cry again .
for one thing , her passion for bread and butter . covered with apple sauce and powdered sugar . was getting to be a serious matter , secretly , [male] was not yet so changed by love as to be wholly indifferent to this refection himself . but his consumption of it was private , whereas [male] had formed the habit of eating it in exposed places . such as the front yard or the sidewalk , at no hour of the day was it advisable for a relative to approach the neighborhood in fastidious company .
everybody was , bundles of candles were procured . and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill , the mouth of the cave was up the hillside . an opening shaped like a letter a , its massive oaken door stood unbarred . within was a small chamber , chilly as an ice house , and walled by nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat . it was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon [location] shining in the sun .
visit the paste and beat the pig alternately for some days . and ascertain if , at the end of that period , the whole is about to turn into gosky patties . if it does not then , it never will ; and in that case the pig may be let loose . and the whole process may be considered as finished , a was an ant who seldom stood still . and who made a nice house in the side of a hill .
and now a general excitement began to prevail on board ; and various predictions relative to the precise day . and even the precise hour at which they would reach [location] . were freely broached , there was infinitely more crowding on deck and looking over the ship 's side than there had been before . and an epidemic broke out for packing up things every morning . which required unpacking again every night , those who had any letters to deliver .
the hand had shut upon it tight , with that rigidity of grasp with which no living man . in the full strength and energy of life . can clutch a prize he has won , they dragged him out into the dark street . but jury , judge , and hangman . could have done no more , and could do nothing now , dead , dead , dead .
more , if he misses the ball altogether upon one or two tees . if he buys a new niblick he is certain to get fun out of it on the very first day . and , above all , there is this to be said for golfing mediocrity -- the bad player can make the strokes of the good player . the poor cricketer has perhaps never made fifty in his life . as soon as he stands at the wickets he knows that he is not going to make fifty today .
additional indications as to beauty are required chiefly where the woman observed precedes the observer . and may , by her figure , naturally and reasonably excite his interest , while at the same time it would be rude to turn and look in her face on passing . there can , therefore , be no impropriety in observing , that the conduct of those who may happen to meet the women thus preceding . will differ according to the sex of the person who meets her. -- if the person meeting her be a man . and the lady observed be beautiful , he will not only look with an expression of pleasure at her countenance .
no ; she would not go to [female] , to whom , then ? the vision of joan valentine came to her . of joan as she had seen her yesterday . strong , cheerful , self reliant , bearing herself , in spite of adversity . with a valiant jauntiness , yes ; she would go and see joan . she put on her hat and stole from the house .
mark you , i am not defending [female] . i hold no brief for [male] . on the contrary , i am very decidedly of the opinion that he should not have done it . i merely say that there were extenuating circumstances , just that , ext , circ . nothing more . let [location] review the matter calmly and judicially .
but he was very definite as to the position in the world that his future son in law must occupy . he would have preferred someone who had made his mark . men of more mature years . he had noticed , were frequently favourably disposed towards young girls as wives . and mr. [male] was determined that he would be proud of his son in law .
he sniffed the smell of the ink and the hot metal like it was june roses . he kind of wanders over to his old desk and slumps down in the chair . and tips it back , and puts his feet on the desk . with his hat tipped back , and a bum stogie in his mouth . and along came a kid with a bunch of papers wet from the presses and sticks one in his hand .
you are traveling -- heaven help you . on a continental train , between spells of having your ticket punched or torn apart . or otherwise mutilated ; and getting out at the border to see your trunks ceremoniously and solemnly unloaded and unlocked . and then as ceremoniously relocked and reloaded after you have conferred largess on everybody connected with the train . the customs regulations being mainly devised for the purpose of collecting not tariff but tips .
while monipodio was in the act of receiving this last report . there came to the door a gentleman in the prime of youth . and dressed in the half rustic manner suitable to the morning , or to one residing in the country . monipodio caused this person to enter the house with himself . he then sent to look for chiquiznaque , repolido , and maniferro .
this , of course , accounts for our having infant prodigies in art . as well as music and the drama , the rapidity with which master hoffmann was followed by infantile lizsts and little [female] hegner as soon as it became apparent that there was a demand for such phenomena . seems to indicate that in music at all events supply will follow demand as a matter of course . and if the infant artist can only be `` crammed '' in daubing on canvas as youthful musicians are in playing on the piano . then perhaps a new sensation is in store for the artistic world .
those first impressions of the life on the boulevards are going to stay in my memory a long . long time -- the people , paired off at the tables of the sidewalk cafes . drinking drinks of all colors ; a little shopgirl wearing her new . cheap , fetching hat in such a way as to center public attention on her head and divert it from her feet . which were shabby ; two small errand boys in white aprons .
you can see the open place in the wall where the written complaints wuz put aginst somebody or anybody . guilty or innocent , and wuz pretty sure to be acted upon by the dretful ten settin there in their black robes and black masks , fit color for their dark and cruel deeds . we did not make a very long stay in [location] . but journeyed on to person -- person the beautiful .
she sat down promptly , there was a little murmur of voices . my guests gathered round me , i drew a long breath and continued on my mendacious career . every one was talking cheerfully , the great topic now was one of ethics : had i acted properly in not charging the waiter ? fortunately some one discovered a little later that it was twelve o'clock and my little party broke up . i was not altogether surprised to receive , on the following morning before i had finished breakfast .
the one which i finally succeeded in isolating was an engaging organism with a provocative manner and a little way of wrinkling up its ectoderm which put you at once at your ease . there could be no formality about your relations with this polyp five minutes after your first meeting . you were just like one great big family , although i have no desire to retail gossip . i think that readers of this treatise ought to be made aware of the fact ( if , indeed . they do not already know it ) that a polyp is really neither one thing nor another in matters of gender .
one consolation he had -- he never descended to tricks . if he were unable to place a subject under control . he stated so frankly , he was scientific , and believed in his own powers as he believed in nothing else on earth . he had achieved some sort of success . it was not what he had hoped for ; still , it was a living .
an artificial oversoul she is , that may presently break down and reveal a human being beneath it . she is still in that schoolgirl phase when a talkative old man is more interesting than a tongue tied young one . and when to be an eminent mathematician , say , or to edit a daily paper . seems as fine an ambition as any girl need aspire to . bechaniel was to have helped her to attain that in the most expeditious manner .
considering their recent achievements , toddie and budge were a very modest couple as i drove them home that evening . budge even made some attempt at apologizing for their appearance . saying that they could not find maggie , and could n't wait any longer ; but i assured him that no apology was necessary . i was in such excellent spirits that my feeling became contagious . and we sang songs , told stories .
in the west indies , the vaudoux orgies are more savage than in this country . it is but a little while since in hayti , under the energetic and sensible administration of president [female] . eight vaudoux worshipers were regularly tried and executed for having murdered a young girl . the niece of two of them , by way of human sacrifice to the god . they tied the poor child tight .
at length , [female] , being weary of soliloquy . addressed himself to his companion , and blamed him for his taciturnity . for which the poor man very honestly accounted , from his fear of giving offence . and now this fear being pretty well removed , by the most absolute promises of indemnity . partridge again took the bridle from his tongue .
as for the sigh , the young lawyer had heard it but once . that was when he was about leaving the room for his three months tour , and he had attributed it to the soughing of the wind in the trees outside of his window . which was indeed an error , as he might have discovered at the time had he taken the trouble to investigate . for there were no trees outside of his window through whose branches a wind could have soughed even if it had been disposed to do so .
[female] , lawyer and bachelor . aged almost forty , was another old virginian grandee with proved descent from the first families . he was a fine , majestic creature , a gentleman according to the nicest requirements of the virginia rule . a devoted presbyterian , an authority on the `` code '' . and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you in the field if any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious to you .
to this all agreed , but no one could think of any method of saving keo from his fate . so months passed away , during which all the royal hippopotamuses were sad and gloomy except the jolly one himself . finally but a week of freedom remained to keo , and his mother . the queen , became so nervous and worried that another meeting of the tribe was called . by this time the laughing hippopotamus had grown to enormous size .
now , here is a clear gain , in a very brief period , of no less than one dollar and twenty five cents . this is in the mere cases of snap and gruff . and i solemnly assure the reader that these extracts are taken at random from my day book . it 's an old saying , and a true one , however , that money is nothing in comparison with health . i found the exactions of the profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body .
never did a mountain seem so close ; its big sides seemed at one 's very elbow . and its majestic dome , and the lofty cluster of slender minarets that were its neighbors . seemed to be almost over one 's head , it was night in the streets . and the lamps were sparkling everywhere ; the broad bases and shoulders of the mountains were in a deep gloom . but their summits swam in a strange rich glow which was really daylight , and yet had a mellow something about it which was very different from the hard white glare of the kind of daylight i was used to .
so persuasive were her entreaties , and so strong her assurances that no harm whatever could result to them from the information she sought . they were induced to confess that one summer 's night . the same she had mentioned , themselves and another friend being out on a stroll with rodolfo . they had been concerned in the abduction of a girl whom rodolfo carried off . whilst the rest of them detained her family .
but in working for themselves they are working for [location] all . we are so bound together that no man can labor for himself alone . each blow he strikes in his own behalf helps to mold the universe . the stream in struggling onward turns the mill wheel . the coral insect , fashioning its tiny cell , joins continents to one another .
can you read or write amid the yells of a nursery ? can you stand being contradicted in the face of all reason ? can you keep your temper when you are not listened to ? can you do what you are told without being told why ? in a word . young sir , have you the patience of job ?
[male] searched in his brain for words . and came empty away , he shook his head dumbly , shall we sit down ? ', said [organization] . [male] indicated silently the sandstone rock on which he had been communing with himself . they sat down , a sense of being preposterously and indecently big obsessed [male] . there seemed no end to him , wherever he looked .
a fear not merely of the evil in the past , but of the good in the past also . the brain breaks down under the unbearable virtue of mankind . there have been so many flaming faiths that we can not hold ; so many harsh heroisms that we can not imitate . so many great efforts of monumental building or of military glory which seem to [location] at once sublime and pathetic . the future is a refuge from the fierce competition of our forefathers .
the lady had scarce warm would herself five minutes at the fire . before she began to turn her head back , and give a look at the beds . and the oftener she cast her eyes that way . the more they return would perplexd ; -- i felt for her -- and for myself . for in a few minutes , what by her looks , and the case itself .
so then i realised where juggins retroactive existence is carrying him to . he has passed back through childhood into infancy . and presently , just as his annuity runs to a point and vanishes . he will back up clear through the curtain of existence and die . or be born , i do not know which to call it , meantime he remains to me as one of the most illuminating allegories i have met .
bixby and clemens were together that winter on the `` child , '' and were the closest friends , once the young pilot invited his mother to make the trip to new orleans . and the river journey and a long drive about the beautiful southern city filled [female] clemens with wonder and delight . she no longer shad any doubts of sam . he had long since become the head of the family .
next morning we walked to rosenlaui , the beau ideal of swiss scenery . where we spent the middle of the day in an excursion to the glacier . this was more beautiful than words can describe , for in the constant progress of the ice it has changed the form of its extremity and formed a vast cavern . as blue as the sky above , and rippled like a frozen ocean , a few steps cut in the whoopjamboreehoo enabled [location] to walk completely under this . and feast our eyes upon one of the loveliest objects in creation .
and i know that if he wanted to set down some news . they had to kill a sheep , and spend several years a dressin off the hide into parchment—and kill a goose . or chase it up till they wuz beat out , for a goose quill . and then after about 20 years or so , they could put it down that miss [female] had got a boy—the boy , probably bein
an in the front they got a cigaret holder . i always heard how the french was cigaret feends , i guess it got so bad they put in the holders sos they could smoke during a gas attack . im goin to put on my mask an have my pictur took en cabinet . thats nothin to do with furniture , mable , its the french for what its goin to look like when its done . the gas fello said the other day that gas was perfectly safe cause you could always tell when it was comin .
[female] played the `` dragon without a tail . '' we had to make him without a tail owing to the smallness of the stage . he had once had a tail , but that was a long story . added to which there was not time to tell it , little sallyleonard played his wife . and [location] was his mother in law .
it seemed tempting providence not to take advantage of such an excellent piece of luck . for the rest , detection was practically impossible , [male] 's advent to the house had ousted fenn from the dormitory in which he had slept hitherto . and , there being no bed available in any of the other dormitories , he had been put into the spare room usually reserved for invalids whose invalidism was not of a sufficiently infectious kind to demand their removal to the infirmary . as for getting back into the house , he would leave the window of his study unfastened . he could easily climb on to the window ledge , and so to bed without let or hindrance .
they struggled while the excited cowboys surged about them . the detective proved to be no match for benson , he was borne to earth . then raised aloft and hurled over the adjacent tables , this bit of acting had involved a trick which was not obscure to merton like his shot into the mirror that brought down a man back of him . moreover , it was a trick of which he approved . when he bore the detective to earth the cameras halted their grinding while a dummy in the striking likeness of the detective was substituted .
while [male] was kissing and mumbling the book , as if he had an excellent brown buttered crust in his mouth or as if he had really been a book worm . or an author who had nothing to eat but his own works . a piece of paper fell from its leaves to the ground . which partridge took up , and delivered to [male] , who presently perceived it to be a bank bill . it was , indeed , the very bill which western had given his daughter the night before her departure .
being hunted with a swivel chair is what makes the german wild boar wild . on occasion , also , the hunter wears . suspended from his belt , a cute little hanger like a sawed off saber . with which to cut the throats of his spoil , then , when it has spoiled some more . they will serve it at a french restaurant .
the rest of them , mrs. [female] implied . might do what they liked , for they did not matter . but she -- she must put on her order and make her curtsy . and [female] , by her expressed desire to stand beside . or even behind , her mother for this degrading moment had showed of what stock she came .
he should not have come out on to the dancing floor , in another moment he was admitting that himself . for just as he was lowering his tray and bending over the table in the pursuance of his professional duties . along came bill at his customary high rate of speed . propelling his partner before him , and for the first time since he left home heinrich was conscious of a regret that he had done so . there are worse things than military service , it was the table that saved bill .
in a little while the man was dead , he was killed in war . killed in fair and legitimate war ; killed in battle , as you might say . and yet he was as sincerely mourned by the opposing force as if he had been their brother . the boys stood there a half hour sorrowing over him . and recalling the details of the tragedy , and wondering who he might be .
nor was it until mr bailey had run after it some hundreds of yards in vain . that he managed to lift his short leg into the iron step . and finally to get his boots upon the little footboard behind , then , indeed , he became a sight to see . and -- standing now on one foot and now upon the other , now trying to look round the cab on this side . now on that , and now endeavouring to peep over the top of it , as it went dashing in among the carts and coaches .
the other , she who was writing , looked at her turbulent companion with an eye as limpid . as pure , and as blue as the azure of the day . her hair , of a shaded fairness , arranged with exquisite taste . fell in silky curls over her lovely mantling cheeks ; she passed across the paper a delicate hand . whose thinness announced her extreme youth , at each burst of laughter that proceeded from her friend .
a maiden knight -- to me is given such hope . i know not fear ; i yearn to breathe the airs of heaven that often meet me here . i muse on joy that will not cease , pure spaces cloth would in living beams . pure lilies of eternal peace , whose odours haunt my dreams . and , stricken by an angel 's hand , this mortal armour that i wear .
shall i eat some plums soon ? it is not the season yet . but here is some peaches what does ripen at the eye sight . it delay me to eat some [organization] nuts kernels . take care not leave to pass the season , person , i shall throw you any nuts during the shell is green yet . the artichoks grow its ? i have a particular care of its , because i know you like the bottoms .
there was a young person in green , who seldom was fit to be seen . she wore a long shawl , over bonnet and all . which enveloped that person in green , there was an old person of fife . who was greatly disgusted with life ; they sang him a ballad . and fed him on salad , which cured that old person of fife .
when he read this , the son of [location] reddened . blanched , and shuddered , all [location] appeared unto him : the club . the cap poppers , [male] 's green arm chair . and , hovering over all like a spread eagle , the imposing moustaches of brave commandant [male] . at seeing himself here , as he was , cowardly lolling on a mat .
for he was more meagre and grim than before , -- we received him the more cordially for having supposed he had been drowned . and he was not deficient in expressions of satisfaction at this meeting . he told us , he had enquired for [location] at dumfries . and been informed by a travelling merchant from glasgow , that we had resolved to return by the way of coldstream . he said , that in passing the sands without a guide .
i must apologize , as i did in the preface to [female] at wrykyn . for all the cricket in this book . it was unavoidable , there is , however , not quite so much of it this time . if [male] had been in time for breakfast that fatal easter morning he might have gathered from the expression on his father 's face . as mr. [male] opened the envelope containing his school report and read the contents .
as we pulled up at the front door , it opened . and a woman 's figure appeared , `` have you got him , bill ? '' she said , which in my present frame of mind struck me as a jolly creepy way of putting it . the sort of thing lady macbeth might have said to macbeth . do not you know , do you mean me ? ', i said .
`` please do not snort , '' said a cold voice , from behind the back hair . there was a train wreck in the land of yesterday . mr ferguson , the only survivor . limped back into the present , she went to a small cupboard in the corner of the room . and from it produced in instalments all that goes to make cake and cocoa .
fo fum had been growing more and more purple , but now he toppled over with a crash . carrying part of the building with him . almost two years before he had been warned by a doctor of apoplexy and sudden anger . [male] did not wait for the verdict of any medical examiner . he seized the speaking tube and shouted down to the composing room .
Vice [female] by [female] at [organization] there is an old story of a punctiliously polite greek . who , while performing the funeral of an infant daughter , felt bound to make his excuses to the spectators for `` bringing out such a ridiculously small corpse to so large a crowd . '' the author , although he trusts that the present production has more vitality than the greek gentleman 's child . still feels that in these days of philosophical fiction , metaphysical romance . and novels with a purpose , some apology may perhaps be needed for a tale which has the unambitious and frivolous aim of mere amusement .
that very night i made my escape on board a vessel bound to [location] . which was then weighing anchor to proceed on her voyage , the last story . gentlemen , i am not fond of mentioning . as i miscarried in the attempt , and was very near losing my life into the bargain . however , as it contains no impeachment of my honour .
if he started his match with [male] at eleven thirty . he would have plenty of time to have his game and be at the end of the board walk at the appointed hour . he had no delusions about the respective merits of [male] and himself as golfers . he knew that [male] would win the necessary ten holes off the reel . it was saddening , but it was a scientific fact .
of course penrod had no way of knowing that . as regards bingism in general , several of the most distinguished old gentlemen in [location] were at that very moment in exactly the same state of mind . georgie [male] was a boy set apart . not only that ; georgie knew that he was a boy set apart , he would think about it for ten or twenty minutes at a time . and he could not look at himself in a mirror and remain wholly without emotion .
marget was enduring her forsakenness and isolation fairly well . all things considered , and was cheerful , by help of wilhelm meidling . she spent an hour or two every night in the jail with her uncle . and had fattened him up with the cat 's contributions . but she was curious to know more about [male] traum .
i flew to my beloved 's help , but what could i do but wait and wring my hands ? he was already fenced away from me by a living wall . he was being bound hand and foot . not until he was secured would they let me get to him . i flung myself upon his poor insulted form and cried my grief out upon his breast while my father and all my family scoffed at me and heaped threats and shameful epithets upon him .
if [organization] do not step on a technicality and fall down , it looks like amusement ahead . and if a district of columbia rule . or martial law , or tocsin of war is the result , gov . [male] is a good style of war governor . he is not the kind of a man to put on his wife 's gossamer cloak and meander over into [location] .
the street called the ring strasse . i spoze because it curves round some like a ring . is three milds long , and most two hundred feet wide , and along this broad beautiful avenue there are six rows of large chestnut trees . a track for horseback riders on one side . a broad carriage driveway , two fine promenades .
when a girl refuses to kiss a man he is never disconcerted . he is merely astonished that she could be so blind to her own feelings . a summer resort is a place where a girl spends half her time in making herself alluring . and the other half in yearning for something to `` lure . '' when a girl marries a man she is sadly aware that all his old sweethearts are wondering how she did it .
terrible in their wrath , the boy scouts never forget kindness . the whistle of a striped [male] sounded softly in the darkness . the sentry , who was pacing to and fro before the camp fire , halted , and peered into the night . as he peered , he uttered the plaintive note of a zebra calling to its mate . a voice from the darkness said , `` een [location] . ''
after supper , uncle brewed some whisky punch , i did justice to that also . uncle [male] himself said so , he said he was glad to notice that i liked it . aunt went to bed soon after supper , leaving the local curate , old dr. scrubbles . mr. [male] , our member of the county council . teddy biffles , and myself to keep uncle company .
the queen was for a time successful , and her army earned a slight reputation for cruelty also . but [male] , son of the late duke of york . embittered somewhat by the flippant death of his father , was soon victorious over the lancastrians . and , in 1461 , was crowned king of england at a good salary . with the use of a large palace and a good well of water and barn .
there are plenty of lazy people and plenty of slow coaches . but a genuine [organization] is a rarity , he is not a man who slouches about with his hands in his pockets . on the contrary , his most startling characteristic is that he is always intensely busy . it is impossible to enjoy idling thoroughly unless one has plenty of work to do . there is no fun in doing nothing when you have nothing to do .
the men were in the towns , the women and children at home in the country getting crippled . killed , frightened to insanity ; and the rain deluging them . the wind howling , the thunder crashing . the lightning glaring , this for an hour or so . then a lull and sunshine ; many ventured out of safe shelter .
he felt physically sick with the shock of the disappointment . for the initial before the name jackson was r . there was no possibility of mistake , since writing was invented . there had never been an r. that looked less like an m. than the one on that list . at the door of the senior block burgess .
`` you must please yourself about that , my dear , '' said mrs. [female] , who , perhaps , felt but little anxiety as to the result . `` i shall certainly accept if the part is at all suitable , '' she might have said more . if ruby had not suddenly burst into the room , ruby was certainly the flower of the family . an extremely engaging young person of about ten , whose mischievous golden brown eyes had long and curling lashes .
it is very wonderful this ; the more one dwells upon it , the greater the mystery grows . some ego within us , acting quite independently of our conscious self . must be capable of counting the hours while we sleep , unaided by clock or sun . or any other medium known to our five senses , it keeps watch through the darkness . at the exact moment it whispers `` time ! ''
`` that 's him , '' was the excited comment , but [male] maintained a grim silence . he had risen to his full height and now stood braced to meet an ordeal which he dreaded far more than he would have been willing to admit . his gaunt figure was stiff with resolution . his jaw set , his lips compressed . it was the same expression his countenance had worn the night he had gone forth into the storm to rescue the sinking crew of the michleen from probable death .
trevor and clowes had come down , after the easter term had been in progress for a fortnight . to play for an oxford a team against the school . the match had resulted in an absurdly easy victory for the visitors by over forty points . clowes had scored five tries off his own bat . and [male] , if he had not fed his wing so conscientiously , would probably have scored an equal number .
the funny thing was that he was not altogether a fool in other ways . deep down in him there was a kind of stratum of sense . i had known him , once or twice , show an almost human intelligence . but to reach that stratum , mind you . you needed dynamite , she was not the sort of girl you would have expected bobbie to rave about .
the afternoon was waning ; in the western sky the great picture of a new england sunset . painted in crimson and silver , was suspended from the zenith . and the stony pastures , as [female] traversed them . thinking intently to herself , were covered with a light , clear glow , at the open gate of one of the fields she saw from the distance a man 's figure . he stood there as if he were waiting for her , and as she came nearer she recognized mr , [male] .
they agreed after some argument that jim . unmolested by females , was to view the spectacle from a secluded settee in the corner where clark would join him whenever he was not dancing . so ten o'clock found the jelly bean with his legs crossed and his arms conservatively folded . trying to look casually at home and politely uninterested in the dancers , at heart he was torn between overwhelming self consciousness and an intense curiosity as to all that went on around him . he saw the girls emerge one by one from the dressing room .
`` they do better still ; the are hanging them , '' murmured fouquet . in a sinister voice , which sounded like a funeral knell in that rich gallery . splendid with pictures , flowers , velvet , and gold . involuntarily every one stopped ; the abbe quitted his window ; the first fuses of the fireworks began to mount above the trees . a prolonged cry from the gardens attracted the superintendent to enjoy the spectacle .
culture for the majority is an acquired taste . speaking personally , i am entirely in agreement with the university professor . i find knowledge , prompting to observation and leading to reflection . the most satisfactory luggage with which a traveller through life can provide himself . i would that i had more of it , to be able to enjoy a picture is of more advantage than to be able to buy it .
this realization of the poetry of [location] is not a small thing . a city is , properly speaking , more poetic even than a countryside , for while nature is a chaos of unconscious forces . a city is a chaos of conscious ones . the crest of the flower or the pattern of the lichen may or may not be significant symbols . but there is no stone in the street and no brick in the wall that is not actually a deliberate symbol .
and now i want to ask a question , or rather make a slight suggestion to you `` strangers '' that these invitations reach . when you are asked to entertain them do not bashfully detain them with that chestnut that you can not make a speech . you may not be a dancer ; or your voice may have a cancer . and as a singer you may be an awful frost . but if you can not do recitations or other fancy recreations .
there were , probably , not a dozen englishmen within reach . the rajah was in his fort with his myriads around him . but no matter , from his little camp in a neighboring garden . hastings sent a party to arrest the sovereign , he sent on this daring mission a couple of hundred native soldiers . sepoys -- under command of three young english lieutenants , the rajah submitted without a word .
he smiled pleasantly as he pictured his reception that evening . as an extra turn , at one of the big music halls , the drowsy atmosphere of the west [location] police court oppressed even the prisoners . they came , heard , and departed ; protagonists for a few minutes in a drama , then oblivion . the magistrate was cross , the clerk husky . and the police anxiously deferential , for one of their number had that morning been severely censured for being unable to discriminate between the effects upon the human frame of laudanum and whisky .
on a certain day mr. [male] told him that the bill would come up for final passage and no doubt pass without opposition . but a purse would have to be raised to defray the expenses , the tribe began to collect what money they had and to sell their grasshoppers in order to raise more . [male] and his people gathered on the day named . and seated themselves in the galleries , slim old warriors with firm faces and beetling brows . to say nothing of having their hair roached , but yet with no flies on them to speak of .
then he tried to understand what it was in particular that he was observing . my wife -- her stepmother , then he remembered her swimming eyes . abruptly came a wave of anger that surprised him . washed away the detective superstructure , and left him plain mr. [male] . this man in brown , with his confident manner , and his proffered half sovereign was up to no good .
the rope crept away quite slowly , at times , at other times with some briskness . twice or thrice we seemed to get the signal . and a shout was just ready to break from the men 's lips when they perceived it was a false alarm . but at last , when over half a mile of rope had slidden away , it stopped gliding and stood absolutely still . one minute -- two minutes -- three -- while we held our breath and watched .
i found a locksmith and left the lock to be fitted with a key . then we drove to the falls , both boys discharged volleys of questions as we stood by the gorge . and the fact that the roar of the falling water prevented me from hearing them did not cause them to relax their efforts in the least . i walked to the hotel for a cigar . taking the children with me , i certainly spent no more than three minutes in selecting and lighting a cigar .
half an hour later i stood before the cottage , set primly in the center of a great lot that extended for half a square on all sides . a winter sodden , bare enough sight it was in the gray of that march day . but it was not long before alma pflugel , standing in the midst of it . the march winds flapping her neat skirts about her ankles . filled it with a blaze of color .
on the following day he did go down to cross [male] . leaving his wife and her father in [female] court without any definite plans . when lord [male] left his own house alone he was very wretched . and his wife , whom he left behind him . was as wretched as himself , of course the matter had not decided itself in this way without very much absolute quarrelling between them .
but as soon as one is at rest , in this world , off he goes on something else to worry about . it occurred to me that i had made another blunder . i had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with a threat . i intending to invent a calamity at my leisure . now the people who are the readiest and eagerest and willingest to swallow miracles are the very ones who are hungriest to see you perform them .
shouts of laughter rent the air . as the wig was pitched out , to undergo a rapid process of radical reform at the hands of the mob . as the wigless farmer made his appearance . he was received with groans of derision . and was glad enough to escape with unbroken bones , the city of [location] was often contested by mr. [male] .
o the misery endured for the want of an errant piece of twine . when you are in a nervous hurry to do up a parcel . some one waiting at the door meanwhile ! after an immense deal of pains , you have it at last folded to your liking . with every corner squared and even , every wrinkle smoothed , then , clasping tightly with one hand the stiff wrapper .
it was not until she threatened to give notice that he reluctantly agreed to leave the arrangements to her . he sent his white flannels to the laundry with a note attached . hinting darkly at legal proceedings if they were not sent back . spotless , by thursday morning , he went about with an expression of set and solemn purpose upon his frowning countenance . [male] he utterly ignored , he bought a book of poems at a second hand bookshop and kept them on the table by his bed .
with a brutal laugh , he drew the struggling girl towards him . in another moment the aristocratic villain would have succeeded in lifting the veil of the unhappy girl . when suddenly a ringing voice cried , hold , stop , desist , begone ! lay to ! cut it out , with these words a tall . athletic young man , attracted doubtless by the girl 's cries .
now we must turn for a few lines to the family of lord [male] . lord [male] was the brother of the marquis of brotherton . whose family residence was at manor cross . about nine miles from the city , the wealth of the family of the germains was not equal to their rank . and the circumstances of the family were not made more comfortable by the peculiarities of the present marquis .
at this moment , when the irish party might have been likened to machinery deprived of its principal wheel . it was curious to notice how energetic mr. [male] became . he tried to cover his position by being unusually active in parliament . he followed the chief secretary for [location] in the debates upon the land purchase bill . to the obvious discomfort of mr. [male] .
at the bank above the switch yard he paused . keeping in a shadow , and looked here and there , flat cars and box cars stood on the tracks in great numbers . most of them closed and sealed -- some partly open , he heard a car door grate as it was closed . he slipped down the bank and crept on his hands and knees . he was halfway down the line of cars when he heard a voice .
the maid at the unicorn is naturally a pleasant girl , but she is jaded by the incessant incidence of cyclists . and [male] 's mind , even as he conversed with her in that cultivated voice of his . of the weather , of the distance from [location] . and of the excellence of the ripley road . wandered to the incomparable freshness and brilliance of the young lady in grey .
and who would not risk its terrors to gain its raptures ? ah , what raptures they were ! the mere recollection thrills you . how delicious it was to tell her that you loved her . that you lived for her , that you would die for her ! how you did rave , to be sure , what floods of extravagant nonsense you poured forth .
it is consequently my degrading duty to serve this upstart as first lord of the treasury . lord chief justice . commander in chief , lord high admiral , master of the buckhounds . groom of the back stairs , archbishop of titipu . and lord mayor , both acting and elect , all rolled into one , and at a salary !
but to those who wish to forget the past and live only in the booming present . to get careless of gain and breathe brand-new air that has never been used . to appease an irritated liver , or straighten out a torpid lung , let me say . pick out a high , dry clime , where there are trout enough to give you an excuse for going there . take what is absolutely necessary and no more , and then stay there long enough to have some fun .
the occupants of the carriage were a small girl . and a smaller girl , and a small boy , an aunt belonging to the children occupied one corner seat . and the further corner seat on the opposite side was occupied by a bachelor who was a stranger to their party . but the small girls and the small boy emphatically occupied the compartment . both the aunt and the children were conversational in a limited , persistent way .
[female] , upstairs in a magnificently appointed chamber . from the windows of which were to be seen the most superb distances that he had ever imagined . was a prey alternately to misery and to joy , he felicitated himself upon the apparent success of his plan . while bemoaning his unhappy lot in having to keep his true self under in a society he felt himself capable of adorning . and to enter which he had always aspired , here [male] paused , and looked apprehensively about him .
before i could think of a reply , one of the sheriffs . in full court costume , slapped farmerson on the back and hailed him as an old friend . and asked him to dine with him at his lodge . i was astonished , for full five minutes they stood roaring with laughter . and stood digging each other in the ribs , they kept telling each other they didn
he plunged forward again with outstretched arms , and stumbled and fell over one of the on the floor section of the opposing force . they seized each other earnestly and rolled across the room till [male] . contriving to secure his adversary 's head , bumped it on the floor with such abandon that . with a muffled yell , the other let go , and for the second time he rose . as he did so he was conscious of a curious thudding sound that made itself heard through the other assorted noises of the battle .
the mutual friend was saved the trouble of suppressing adolphus . until [male] had finished adolphus never got an opening , he grumbled at their dinners , he ! who can dine night after night with his precious freemasons . does he think she likes them any better ? she , doomed to stay at home and eat them .
everyone , even the clerk of the weather . had arranged that my visit to [location] should be pleasant , niagara , to be seen at its best . must be viewed on a pouring wet day , i know few of my readers will accept this assertion as a serious fact . but it 's true , it is just as true as the fact that the way to obtain the full flavour of strawberries is to put person on them . and that the sole method of fully relishing ham is to use a dash of champagne as a sauce .
his knowledge of psychology had not misled him . directly they gathered that he was advertising something . the crowd declined to look at it ; they melted away . and [male] returned to his work in solitude . he was taking a well earned rest after playing his eleven hundred and fifth .
i had seen him frequently , and he was pale and thin to emaciation . he could not live long if he remained where he was . i spoke earnestly of his good character since his incarceration , and the governor promised prompt action . but he was called away in december and i feared that he might . in the rush and pressure of other business .
he rather had [location] there , the drama of the country was . to our taste -- rather flat , you see , they lacked the sex motive and . with it , jealousy , they had no interplay of warring nations . no aristocracy and its ambitions , no wealth and poverty opposition . i see i have said little about the economics of the place .
whilst the comte [female] la fere with raoul visits the new buildings he has erected . and the new horses he has bought , with the reader 's permission we will lead him back to the city of blois . and make him a witness of the unaccustomed activity which pervades that city . it was in the hotels that the surprise of the news brought by raoul was most sensibly felt . in fact , the king and the court at blois .
person looks at me -- me , age fourteen . as if i might actually know , and it 's kind of unnerving . everyone i know , their life goes along in set periods . grade school , junior high , high school . college , and maybe getting married , they do not really have to think what comes next .
he still has a natural parting of the hair about five inches long . that he acquired that night , he said it was accidental so far as he was concerned . but unless the management could keep people from shooting the holders of reserved seats between the acts or any other vital spot . he would withdraw his patronage , and he was right about it . i think that any court in the land would protect a man who had purchased a seat in good faith .
then [female] walked down to mrs. [female] 's boarding house . all for the purpose of showing a lady there with a skirt to make over just how she had seen a similar garment rearranged exquisitely . and alice strolled down to the gate with her to say good by . and they had so much to talk about that [female] walked alice nearly to our house . and then insisted on her coming the rest of the way so she might be driven home .
the concerns of religion are a vital matter here yet . a vigilant eye is kept upon sunday , museums and other dangerous resorts are not allowed to be open . you may sail on the bay , but it is wicked to play cricket . for a while a sunday concert was tolerated , upon condition that it must be admission free and the money taken by collection . but the collection was alarmingly large and that stopped the matter , they are particular about babies .
it was incredible , absolutely incredible , for a moment , that it was really my name that was coupled with this disgraceful suspicion . three long years had passed over my head since i had tasted ale . beer , wine or liquor of any kind . how about that old woman you kiked of your premises which was beging , pol , pry . there is things which you have done which is unbeknowens to anybody but me .
she turned [location] over to a stout brunette lady who was cultivating a neat and flossy pair of muttonchops . this person escorted [location] down the aisle to where our seats were . so i tipped her , alongside our seats stood a third member of the sisterhood . chiefly distinguished from her confreres by the fact that she was turning out something very fetching in the way of a brown vandyke . and after we were seated she continued to stand there , holding forth her hand toward me .
when at my [female] 's deeds sublime , a soldier 's pulse beats double time . and grave hearts thrill as brave hearts will at tales of martial glory . i [male] with flush of pride and joy . a pride unbittered by alloy , to find my boy . my darling boy , the theme of song and story .
up to 1872 but one of these orders was represented in this general conference , this general conference was strictly a clerical organization . but in 1872 we marked a new epoch in methodist history . and a new element came into this body , and has been in all our sessions since that date . the first step , as has been mentioned here before , was taken in 1868 . when the question of lay delegation was sent down to the members of the church over twenty one years of age .
work , you higher middle class slave . or you shall come down to the smoking of twopenny cigars . harder yet , or you shall drink shilling claret ; harder , or you shall lose your carriage and ride in a penny bus . your wife 's frocks shall be of last year 's fashion . your trousers shall bag at the knees ; from kensington you shall be banished to kilburn .
in this he is the very opposite of the austere scot who sits midway of the table . he can not tell a lie in an unplausible way . when the [male] finishes a statement the passengers glance at each other privately . as who should say , `` do you believe that ? '' when the scot finishes one . the look says , `` how strange and interesting , '' the whole secret is in the manner and method of the two men .
my eyes were upon the loser of this duel when he got his last and vanquishing wound . it was in his face and it carried away his . but no matter , i must not enter into details , i had but a glance . and then turned quickly , but i would not have been looking at all if i had known what was coming . no , that is probably not true ; one thinks he would not look if he knew what was coming .
she wore a dress like the sunset of a fine summer evening . and she effervesced with spacious good will to all men . she was one of those girls who splash into public places like stones into quiet pools . her form was large , her eyes were large , her teeth were large . and her voice was large , she overwhelmed bill .
and a paint brush along for use in the constellations . and are open to terms , cremationists are reminded that we are going straight to . some hot places -- and are open to terms , to other parties our enterprise is a pleasure excursion . but individually we mean business , we shall fly our comet for all it is worth . or for freight or passage , apply on board .
they had now but few people on board . and these few were as flat , as dull , and stagnant , as the vegetation that oppressed their eyes . no sound of cheerfulness or hope was heard . no pleasant talk beguiled the tardy time ; no little group made common cause against the full depression of the scene . but that , at certain periods , they swallowed food together from a common trough .
i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island . and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town . three mile away , where there was three or four lights twinkling , a monstrous big lumber raft was about a mile up stream . coming along down , with a lantern in the middle of it . i watched it come creeping down , and when it was most abreast of where i stood i heard a man say .
when the model had at length thoroughly subjugated and subdued the black haired one . and reduced her to a state of passive misery . she turned to her visitor with an amiable smile . and asked him if he desired to see the madame . receiving an affirmative reply , she gave a sly kick to her fallen foe .
she came in view at this moment . a trim little figure in a white skirt and a pale blue sweater . she waved to archie ; and archie , as always at the sight of her . was conscious of that jumpy , fluttering sensation about the heart . which , translated into words , would have formed the question , `` what on earth could have made a girl like that fall in love with a chump like me ? ''
so what better man to meet a duke than an archaeological president ? and if the duke should feel inclined , as a result of his [location] visit ( for dr. [male] . who knew everything , understood what the duke had come for ) , inclined , let [location] say . to endow a chair in primitive anthropology , or do any useful little thing of the sort . that was only fair business all round ; or if he even was willing to give a moderate sum towards the general fund of plutoria university .
the ugly exactitudes of business , the bells and clocks the fixed hours and rigid departments . were all meant for the male : who , as a rule . can only do one thing and can only with the greatest difficulty be induced to do that . if clerks do not try to shirk their work , our whole great commercial system breaks down . it is breaking down , under the inroad of women who are adopting the unprecedented and impossible course of taking the system seriously and doing it well .
in german , all the nouns begin with a capital letter . now that is a good idea ; and a good idea , in this language . is necessarily conspicuous from its lonesomeness , i consider this capitalizing of nouns a good idea . because by reason of it you are almost always able to tell a noun the minute you see it . you fall into error occasionally , because you mistake the name of a person for the name of a thing .
finally , by a process of elimination and deduction . i arrived at the right one , to make it harder for me they had put it around a corner in an elbow shaped wing of the building and had taken the sign off the door . this place was full of porters and loud cries . to be on the safe side i tendered retaining fees to three of the porters . and thus by the time i had satisfied the customs officials that i had no imported spirits or playing cards or tobacco or soap .
he had put out the lights and was blazing away at the open door . the colonel sprang for cover inside the car . and was not touched , but one of the shots took me just above the knee . and broke my leg , so i went down in a heap , the minute the colonel counted seven shots he was on to that express messenger like a tiger . and had him tied up in a hard knot before you could shake a stick .
she had finished unpacking and tidying up , the next move was certainly to go and see ginger . she had suddenly become aware that she wanted very badly to see ginger . his stolid friendliness would be a support and a prop . she wished now that she had sent him a cable . so that he could have met her at the dock .
the master who looked after the music of the school . and incidentally accompanied the hymn with which prayers at wrykyn opened . was waiting , puzzled , at the foot of the dais , it seemed improbable that things would go on as usual . and he did not know whether he was expected to be at the organ , or not . the headmaster 's placid face reassured him .
the boys helped me , or i never could have got in , just as we finished . sir [male] happened in , and i saw that as like as not i had not chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip . how stately he looked ; and tall and broad and grand , he had on his head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears . and for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his upper lip and protected his nose . and all the rest of him , from neck to heel .
what he always did was to start five minutes before the time and run . i do not know why , but this was the custom of the suburb , many stout city gentlemen lived at ealing in those days . i believe some live there still -- and caught early trains to town , they all started late . they all carried a black bag and a newspaper in one hand . and an umbrella in the other ; and for the last quarter of a mile to the station .
the student should then take a medical and surgical course , so that he may be able to attend to contusions . fractures and so forth , which may occur to himself or to the party who may come to his office for a retraction and by mistake get his spinal column double leaded . ten years should then be given to the study of law . no thorough , metropolitan editor wants to enter upon the duties of his profession without knowing the difference between a writ of mandamus and other styles of profanity . he should thoroughly understand the entire system of [location] jurisprudence .
the gem of the afternoon would be the mile . for not even the shrewdest judge of form could say whether jim would beat drake . or drake jim , both had done equally good times in practice . and both were known to be in the best of training , the adherents of jim pointed to the fact that he had won the half off drake . by a narrow margin , true , but still he had won it .
in traveling about the country lecturing , a good pugilist would be of great assistance . i would like to set him on the man who always asks . `` where do you go to from here , mr. [male] ? '' he does not ask because he wants to know , for the next moment he asks right over again . i do not know why he asks , but surely it is not for the purpose of finding out .
the third and fourth rounds were shot , billy discharged his last shot , which left the rights of parties thus . [male] first and fourth choice , spivey second . firmby third and [organization] , some of my readers may perhaps be curious to learn how a distinction comes to be made between several . all of whom drive the cross , the distinction is perfectly natural and equitable , threads are stretched from the uneffaced parts of the once intersecting lines . by means of which the original position of the cross is precisely ascertained .
it seemed to the effect that simard would take me to his own room . where we might talk over our plans , and now simard rose again from his chair . and said to the president that if nothing more were wanted of him . we should go , accordingly we left the place of meeting together . i watched my comrade narrowly , there was now a trembling eagerness in his action .
the telephone exchange was jammed as calls flooded in to mobilize the boy scouts . [organization] , the salvation army . the national guard , and the volunteer flood control association . when the wail finally died out ( which was not until seven thirty , because it had devoured both cabbages during the night and had grown to more than twice its original size ) . the police entered the hotel in force .
[male] also established a settlement on the south east coast of greenland in about latitude 60 degrees north . these people remained here for some time , subsisting on shrimp salad . sea moss farina , and neat's foot oil , but finally they became so bored with the quiet country life and the backward springs that they removed from there to a land that is fairer than day . to use the words of another , they removed during the holidays . leaving their axle grease and all they held dear , including their remains .
nocturnal visit to the school had had the effect of giving violent colds to three lords . a baronet , and the younger son of an honourable , and , in addition to that . mr abney himself , his penetrating tenor changed to a guttural croak . was in his bed looking on the world with watering eyes . his views , therefore , on playing in the snow as an occupation for boys were naturally prejudiced .
the old woman , true to the instincts of her sex . refused to wear her bonnet again , like many of her sisters of modern times . she had not before discovered the possibilities in a bonnet to enhance the beauty of the face or decrease its charms . if woman could see themselves objectively , as did the old woman . they would keenly realize the necessity of considering the lines of hat or bonnet in relation to those of their faces .
yet in spite of everything , people insist on spoiling conversation by telling stories . i know nothing more dreadful at a dinner table than one of these amateur raconteurs . except perhaps , two of them , after about three stories have been told , there falls on the dinner table an uncomfortable silence . in which everybody is aware that everybody else is trying hard to think of another story . and is failing to find it , there is no peace in the gathering again till some man of firm and quiet mind turns to his neighbour and says .
we reached wimpfen -- i think it was wimpfen . in about three hours , and got out , not the least tired ; found a good hotel and ordered beer and dinner . then took a stroll through the venerable old village , it was very picturesque and tumble down . and dirty and interesting , it had queer houses five hundred years old in it . and a military tower 115 feet high , which had stood there more than ten centuries .
as strikingly uniform as are the statistics of suicide , they are not any more so than are those of the tiger 's annual output of slaughtered human beings in [location] . the government 's work is quite uniform , too ; it about doubles the tiger 's average . in six years the tiger killed 5,000 persons , minus 50 . in the same six years 10,000 tigers were killed , minus 400 , the wolf kills nearly as many people as the tiger . 700 a year to the tiger 's 800 odd -- but while he is doing it .
about the british snob , on the contrary , there is commonly no noise , no bluster . but the calmness of profound conviction , we are better than all the world . we do not question the opinion at all ; it 's an axiom . and when a frenchman bellows out , la [female] . monsieur , la [male] est a la tete du monde civilise !
[female] gave her a long , cold , mystic look . rose to his feet and left the room with emphasis and dignity . for a moment she was puzzled , but [female] 's older brother was this year completing his education at a university . and mrs. [female] was not altogether ignorant of the obligations of secrecy imposed upon some brotherhoods . so she was able to comprehend [male] 's silent withdrawal .
their position was a strong one , a cricket [female] may seem to be an autocrat of tremendous power . but in reality he has only one weapon . the keenness of those under him , with the majority . of course , the fear of being excluded or ejected from a team is a spur that drives . the majority , consequently , are easily handled , but when a cricket [male] runs up against a boy who does not much care whether he plays for the team or not .
it shone now with health and beauty . it seemed to reflect light , like a copper vessel . just such a baby bellini sets languid on his mother 's lap . or signorelli flings wriggling on pavements of marble . or [male] di credi , more reverent but less divine .
outside of melbourne , victoria seems to be owned by a handful of squatters . each with a [location] for a sheep farm , that is the impression which one gathers from common talk . yet the wool industry of victoria is by no means so great as that of new south wales . the climate of victoria is favorable to other great industries . among others , wheat growing and the making of wine .
so we rode onward together , a trooper with his carbine unslung on either side of our prisoner . the village was but a little place , and i set a guard at the ends of the single street . so that no one could escape from it , it was necessary to call a halt and to find some food for the men and horses . since they had travelled all night and had a long journey still before them . there was one large stone house in the centre of the village .
mae bought a thumb ring and a pug dog . and began to speak of the swede help as `` the maid . '' then she decided that she wanted to live in a house . because , in a flat , one could never be sure of one 's neighbors . so they moved into a sarcophagus on the boulevard .
the morrow , on which sheen expected his eye to look curious . was the day he had promised to play fives with mr spence . he hoped that at the early hour at which they had arranged to play it would not have reached its worst stage . but when he looked in the glass at a quarter to seven . he beheld a small ridge of purple beneath it .
most of the taxis is swalowed up in the mud , theys only two or three runnin now . only the big strong fellos can get to town , the cook says its the old theory of the arrival of the fittest . but i guess you dont know nothin about cience , mable . when i go to town i wrap my blouze in a newspaper . if they know your goin they give you a list of things to get that looks like a chinese message to [organization] .
how long the scrimmage might have lasted it is impossible to say , it was ended by the judgment of [male] . for a while he had been seeking to catch , not the dog but the remaining pig . the one still capable of activity , cornering it at last , he persuaded it to cease running round and round the room . and instead to take a spin outside , it shot through the door with one long wail . we always desire the thing we have not .
on the following night , for the first time in his life . [male] found himself behind the scenes of a theatre . and instantly began to experience all the complex emotions which come to the layman in that situation . that is to say , he felt like a cat which has strayed into a strange hostile back yard . he was in a new world , inhabited by weird creatures .
they would begin , perhaps , by extolling each other : [male] , when informed that his friend would be fifty four next birthday . flatly refused to believe it , and , indeed , he was quite right in so doing . because the major was in reality fifty six , in turn . major [male] would say that his friend had the figure of a boy of twenty . which caused [male] presently to feel a little cramped and to wander negligently in front of the big looking glass between the windows .
on leaving the sadly altered form of our former chief executive we descended a flight of stone steps leading to the chamber of horrors . this department was quite crowded with parents escorting their children about . like [location] , [location] appears to be well stocked with parents who make a custom of taking their young and susceptible offspring to places where the young ones stand a good chance of being scared into connipshun fits . the official guide was in the chamber of horrors . he was piloting a large group of visitors about .
after this he sat silent for a few minutes . and i am inclined to think that he was weighing in his mind the expediency of asking her to become mrs rubb . on the spur of the moment , but if so , his mind finally gave judgment against the attempt . and in giving such judgment his mind was right , he would certainly have so startled her by the precipitancy of such a proposition . as to have greatly endangered the probability of any further intimacy with her , as it was .
the jews were accused of clipping the coins of the realm . demanding one hundred per cent , usury , bewitching the people . sacrificing christian boys on the altar of religious fanaticism and setting fire to the warehouses and shipping along the thames . these outrageous stories were believed by many people , and shakspere , being infected by the hate of the multitude ( for the first time in his intellectual career ) . fashioned the repulsive character of shylock , who walks the world as a synonym of greed .
whilst the comte , with grimaud , was busy procuring horses to go straight to [location] . d'artagnan hastened to the hostelry where , according to his orders . his little army was to wait for him , these gentlemen were at breakfast upon oysters . fish , and spiced brandy , when d'artagnan appeared . they were all very gay , but not one of them had yet exceeded the bounds of reason .
let it be said here that this was not the ordinary self delusion of an incompetent . ventimore really had talent above the average , with ideals and ambitions which might under better conditions have attained recognition and fulfilment before this . but he was not quite energetic enough , besides being too proud , to push himself into notice . and hitherto he had met with persistent ill luck , so [male] had no other occupation now but to give beevor . whose offices and clerk he shared .
into the principal parlour of this place entered two strangers . who found themselves , as is always the case in such hostels . the object , not of fluttered curiosity or pert inquiry . but of steady , ceaseless , devouring ocular study , they had long coats down to their heels . and carried under each coat something that looked like a stick .
the magistrate , mr. [male] . waxed very wroth , and as he could not punish me , and would not reprimand the police . i was asked to pay the costs of the summons . which was withdrawn , the late mr. [male] . who sat in the marylebone police court .
she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr. [male] 's house . which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with . no , he could not believe it a bad house . not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having , if it were to be shared with the woman he loved . he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house .
he gripped the arms of his seat when the cast of hearts on fire was flung to the screen . he caught his own name instantly , and was puzzled , [male] armytage , by himself . someone had bungled that , but no matter , then at once he was seeing that first scene of his . as a popular screen idol he breakfasted in his apartment . served by a valet who was a hero worshipper .
and mr , [male] walked out of the room . in affairs of this kind a master has a habit of getting the last word . they say misfortunes never come singly , as [male] sat brooding over his wrongs in his study . after the [male] incident , [male] came into the room . and , without preamble , asked for the loan of a sovereign , when one has been in the habit of confining one 's lendings and borrowings to sixpences and shillings .
in response , the government kills . in the six years , a total of 3,201,232 wild beasts and snakes . ten for one , it will be perceived that the snakes are not much interested in cattle . they kill only 3,000 odd per year . the snakes are much more interested in man , [location] swarms with deadly snakes .
yes , ten years , the courtships last ten years ! and is it , after all , too long , when the being bound for life is in consideration ? one studies ten years to become an engineer or physician . an advocate or attorney , and should less time be spent in acquiring the knowledge to make a good husband ? is it not reasonable ? and , whether due to temperament or reason with them .
i showed them into the classroom and switched on the light . the air was full of many odours , disuse seems to bring out the inky chalky . appley deal boardy bouquet of a classroom as the night brings out the scent of flowers . during the term i had never known this classroom smell so exactly like a classroom . i made use of my free hand to secure and light a cigarette .
the gazeka was wearing a pair of very squeaky boots that morning . they sounded deafening as he walked out of the room . presently a distant squeaking was heard , and firby smith returned , bearing a large sheet of paper . the headmaster thanked him , and spread it out on the reading desk . then , calmly , as if it were an occurrence of every day .
what a frightful distance he would fall , -- for there are very few birds that fly as high as his starting point . he would strike and bounce , two or three times , on his way down . but this would be no advantage to him , i would as soon take an airing on the slant of a rainbow as in such a front yard . i would rather , in fact , for the distance down would be about the same . and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce , i could not see how the peasants got up to that chalet .
i shall never carve a place for myself in the world . but as years went on he became either less self-conscious or more self satisfied , the world . he found , made a niche for him as it did for every one . decision of character might come later -- or he might have it without knowing . at all events he had got a sense of beauty and a sense of humour .
oh , the incredible self conceit of human nature , here was this ruffian proclaiming the limitations of valmont . who half an hour before had shaken his hand within the innermost circle of his order ! yet my heart warmed towards the wretch who had remembered me and my exploits . it now became my anxious and difficult task to lure simard away from this cafe and its absinthe . glass after glass of the poison had brought him up almost to his former intellectual level .
at m -- hospital in [location] . after a brief illness , mr. [male] by this time has qualified in [location] as the executor of your uncle 's will and has retained [location] as his [organization] representatives . he incloses a copy of the will , in which you are named as sole heir . with conditions attending , will you call at our office this afternoon . if it is convenient ? it is important that you know the contents of the instrument at once .
if ever you by word of mouth inquired of mister forth the way to somewhere in the south . he always sent you north , with little boys his beat along he loved to stop and play . he loved to send old ladies wrong , and teach their feet to stray . he was not naturally bad , or viciously inclined , but from his early youth he had a waggish turn of mind . the men of [location] grimly scowled with indignation wild .
i only mentioned educere and the drawing out of the faculties in order to point out that even this mental trick does not avoid the inevitable idea of parental or scholastic authority . the educator drawing out is just as arbitrary and coercive as the instructor pouring in . for he draws out what he chooses , he decides what in the child shall be developed and what shall not be developed . he does not draw out the neglected faculty of forgery . he does not lead out , with timid steps , a shy talent for torture .
just a coming in now , zur , said the porter , adding , in a sort of inspired frenzy , 'orton ! orton stertion , orton , and ringing a bell with immense enthusiasm and vigour . gethryn strolled to the gate , where the station master 's son stood at the receipt of custom to collect the tickets . his uncle was to arrive by this train , and if he did so arrive . must of necessity pass this way before leaving the platform .
they were exceedingly merry over this jest , and many smart things were said concerning it . but [male] was not as fair in his behaviour as might have been expected . for , after luring [male] on for a long time , he suddenly went over to the enemy . and swore to everything his sister said , however , as [male] observed the same night before going to bed . it was only in joke , and [male] had always been famous for being polite to ladies .
after this mr. [male] , in conclusion . read a very beautiful hindu poem , translating it as he went along . it began , o cow , standing beside the ganges . and apparently without visible occupation , and it was voted exquisite by all who heard it . the absence of rhyme and the entire removal of ideas marked it as far beyond anything reached as yet by occidental culture .
miss pillenger walked down the sleepy street in the june sunshine . boiling , as mr meggs had done , with indignation . she , too , had been shaken to the core , it was her intention to fulfil her duty by posting the letters which had been entrusted to her . and then to quit for ever the service of one who , for six years a model employer . had at last forgotten himself and showed his true nature .
the second appearance of the ghost was on sunday night . shortly after they had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the [male] . rushing down stairs , they found that a large suit of old armour had become detached from its stand . and had fallen on the stone floor , while seated in a high backed chair was the [organization] ghost . rubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face .
he saw [male] surge against the pillars and bring the temple down in ruins about him . he saw [male] 's death . he told of the daily life in heaven . he had seen the damned writhing in the red waves of hell . and he made [location] see all these things .
the servants in our house were all kind to me and were fond of me . and so , as you see , mine was a pleasant life . there could not be a happier dog that i was , nor a gratefuller one . i will say this for myself , for it is only the truth . i tried in all ways to do well and right , and honor my mother 's memory and her teachings .
whether it was mere indolence or whether the advertised docility of that other parrot belonging to [male] 's brother 's wife 's sister had caused him to realize that there was a certain standard of good conduct for his species one can not say . but for a while bill merely contemplated temptation with a detached eye , `` wow wow wow ! '' yapped the dog , suddenly returning to the scene and going on with the argument at the point where he had left off . the effect on bill was catastrophic , ever a high strung bird . he lost completely the repose which stamps the caste of vere [male] vere and the better order of parrot .
from that moment no other thing in those forty feet of canvas has any charm . one sees the hair trunk , and the hair trunk only . and to see it is to worship it , bassano even placed objects in the immediate vicinity of the supreme feature whose pretended purpose was to divert attention from it yet a little longer and thus delay and augment the surprise . for instance , to the right of it he has placed a stooping man with a cap so red that it is sure to hold the eye for a moment . to the left of it , some six feet away .
we see him stop at a large shop . and with the bland clerk 's courteous aid this was the purchase that he made . a bicycle of finest make , with modern gear and patent brake . pedometer , pneumatic tire , and spokes that looked like silver wire . a lantern bright to shine at night , enamel finish .
and when he dared the other boys to do the same thing and none of them would take the dare . it made him mighty proud and puffed up . got to charging the bigger boys and the lounger around the post office a cent to see him eat a piece of dirt the size of a hickory nut . found there was good money in that , and added grasshoppers , at two cents apiece . as a side line , found them so popular that he took on chinch bugs at a nickel .
when we were somewhat recovered from the overpowering effusions of our grief . [male] desired that we would consider what was the most prudent step to be taken in our unhappy situation while he repaired to his imprisoned freind to lament over his misfortunes . we promised that we would , and he set forwards on his journey to town . during his absence we faithfully complied with his desire and after the most mature deliberation . at length agreed that the best thing we could do was to leave the house .
he then opened the packet of arrowroot and poured it into a white pudding basin . at the point where mrs. [female] was to have indicated the quantity of arrowroot to be used . she had been more than usually short of breath , with the result that bindle did not catch the `` two tablespoonfuls '' she had mentioned . he then turned to the stove to watch the milk . forgetting that mrs. [male] had warned him to mix the arrowroot into a thin paste with cold milk before pouring on to it the hot .
i tell araminta that it is not the running of an automobile that is expensive . it is the stopping of it . they were so queer , so very queer , i laughed as i would die . albeit , in the general way , a sober man am i . i called my servant , and he came .
mr. [male] had in use became loosened . and smiled across the road bed and right of way at the bran fired new array of incisors . cuspids , bi cuspids and molars that flew out of the valise . mr. [male] got up and tried to look merry . but he could not smile without his teeth , the back seams of his newmarket coat were more successful , however .
in that last item lay the trouble , in the [location] book he tells of it in a way that no one may hope to equal . and if the details are not exact , the truth is there -- at least in substance . presently he turned to me and said : `` what 's the name of the first point above new orleans ? '' i was gratified to be able to answer promptly , and i did , i said i did not know . his manner jolted me , i was down at the foot again .
as person spoke these words the chair stopped rocking . and if its attitude meant anything . its invisible occupant was leaning forward and staring with pained astonishment at the young lawyer . who was leaning gracefully against the mantelpiece , then on a sudden the chair 's attitude was relaxed and it rocked slowly backward again . resuming its former pace , a few minutes passed without a word being spoken .
mrs. pugh is a woman of medium height and size . with a clear grey eye , and light hair . and wearing that sycophantic smile peculiar to people who have much to do with ugly babies whose beauty must be constantly praised to the doting parents . she was attired in a neat calico dress . constructed for family use , and for the particular accommodation of the younger members of the household .
a concentration of events had brought it about that . at one and the same time , abalene , after a dazzling run of the dice . found the hauling business an actual danger to the preservation of his liberty . he won seventeen dollar and sixty cents . and within the hour found himself in trouble with an officer of the humane society on account of an altercation with whitey .
everything to make the picnic a success is there except the salt , ah ! woe is me , we forget the salt . we slave at our desks , in our workshops . to make a home for those we love ; we give up our pleasures . we give up our rest , we toil in our kitchen from morning till night .
my friends launch cast [location] loose just below the grotto . and then [female] wanted to make out that it was my turn to pull . this seemed to me most unreasonable , it had been arranged in the morning that i should bring the boat up to three miles above reading . well , here we were , ten miles above reading ! surely it was now their turn again , i could not get either [male] or [male] to see the matter in its proper light , however .
we arranged to start on the following saturday from [location] . [female] and i would go down in the morning . and take the boat up to chertsey , and [female] , who would not be able to get away from the city till the afternoon ( [male] goes to sleep at a bank from ten to four each day . except saturdays , when they wake him up and put him outside at two ) . would meet [location] there , [male] and i were for camping out .
of course , our fighting blood is up , we are determined to qualify as soon as possible . some day we will climb that acropolis roped together with [male] . [male] and burns mantle , there will be a little trepidation in the ascent . to be sure , one false step , one blunder , would be fatal , and we have known the other members of the party to make these blunders . but we will reach the top at last and stand wonderingly in the moonlight .
mama always found me her best scholar , tho when papa was alive eloisa was his , never to be sure were there two more different dispositions in the world . we both loved reading , she preferred histories . and i receipts , she loved drawing . pictures , and i drawing pullets , no one could sing a better song than she .
his lady , persuaded of his death , had been urged into a marriage with a rich somebody else . in ordinary life , of course , the man would have contented himself with continuing to make love to the lady . leaving the rich somebody else to pay for her keep , this young couple . however , a little lighter headed , or a little deeper hearted than the most of us . whichever it may have been , and angry at the mocking laughter with which the air around them seemed filled .
the chase began , four waiters were sent around one way and four another . [female] caught hold of two of them by the coat . and another struggle took place before the pursuit of [male] could be resumed . he was finally pinioned after overturning a sugar bowl and several cups of coffee . a fresh argument ensued at the cashier 's desk .
a great deal of `` to do '' is often made of the difficulty involved in undressing in an upper berth but most of this is quite uncalled for . experienced travellers now generally wait until the lights of the car have been dimmed or extinguished when the disrobing can be done quite simply in five counts . as follows : one -- unloosen all clothing and lie flat on the back , the respiration should be natural . easy and through the lungs , the muscles should be relaxed ; two -- pivoting on the back of the head and neck . inhale quickly , at the same time drawing the muscles of the legs and arms sharply under the body .
he did not look at the ladies as he spoke . but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful , [male] , too , was perplexed ; but she saw that they were in for what is known as `` quite a scene , '' and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt . not with rooms and views , but with -- well , with something quite different . whose existence she had not realized before , now the old man attacked miss [female] almost violently .
it began to be a house that was avoided by the tender minded -- some church bought a lot diagonally opposite for a graveyard . and this , combined with `` the place where mrs. curtain stays with that living corpse , '' was enough to throw a ghostly aura over that quarter of the road . not that she was left alone , men and women came to see her . met her down town , where she went to do her marketing .
what do you mean ? he said hoarsely , in dze garten . i you vrom a window did zee . you und violed , zo , and [male] . in the worst taste , gave a realistic imitation of the scene . himself sustaining the role of [male] .
i received a smart smack in the face from a rolled up ball of hard foolscap . i turned round sharply , but all the clerks were apparently riveted to their work . i am not a rich man , but i would give half a sovereign to know whether that was thrown by accident or design . went home early and bought some more enamel paint—black this time—and spent the evening touching up the fender . picture frames , and an old pair of boots .
the simplest and best thing will be found to be a plain sacque or kimono . cut very full so as to allow of the freest movement , and buttoned either down the front or back or both . if the sleeve is cut short at the elbow and ruffled above the bare arm . the effect is both serviceable and becoming , it will be better , especially for such work as lighting the gas range and boiling water . to girdle the kimono with a simple yet effective rope or tasselled silk .
they call him `` the unknown hero . '' it is enough , it is better that we should know him as the unknown soldier . ', hero suggests a superman and implies somebody exalted above his fellows . this man was one of many , we do not know what was in his heart when he died . it is entirely possible that he was a fearful man .
thus far is partly from the evidence for the prosecution , for the defence . it was contended that it was excessively ungentlemanly to deprive any gentleman of the seat such gentleman might have occupied at the commencement of the performance . and furthermore , that the little round man was so roughly handled , that it was absolutely necessary for him to kick in his own defence . for , having once lost his perpendicular position , his rotundity of form made it extremely probable that he would roll over the front of the boxes into the pit ! indeed it was asserted that his enemies endeavoured to bring about that shocking catastrophe .
dying eyes , dim with a black shadow . blacker than the shadow of the valley . cast from agony and sin . sold to the crazed multitude for its undoing by sane men for the silver of judas . love stronger than life , mightier than death , never to be rewarded here , but we read of a time of rewards for deeds done in the body .
i was gettin sick of it . i went to the top sargent an says i guessed id be a speshulist to . he said all right hed make me a food speshulist . said id have to go into it pretty deep , i been into it up to my elbows in the kitchen ever since . never trust sargents , least of all top sargents , if it keeps on like this there wont be nobody to do the actual fightin but me , mable .
but this negative neutral tinted misery was not to last ; i was harmless enough , but then to some natures nothing is so offensive as inoffensiveness . my isolation was certain to raise me up an enemy in time . and he came in the person of one [male] ormsby . i suspect now that if i had made ever so slight a stand at the outset . i should have escaped further molestation , but i was not pugnacious by nature .
every day or two , during this time of sorrow . [male] watched his opportunity and went to the little grated jail window and smuggled such small comforts through to the `` murderer '' as he could get hold of . the jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village . and no guards were afforded for it ; indeed , it was seldom occupied . these offerings greatly helped to ease [male] 's conscience .
but to his surprise and indignation , an hour elapsed . and the man did not present it , the dean again looked out . the day was cold and wet , and the wretched petitioner still retained her situation . with many an eloquent and anxious look at the house , the benevolent divine lost all patience . and was going to ring the bell , when he observed the servant cross the street .
it was at this time that galileo noticed the swinging of a lamp in a church . and , observing that the oscillations were of equal duration , he inferred that this principle might be utilized in the exact measurement of time . from this little accident , years after , came the clock . one of the most useful of man 's dumb friends , and yet there are people who will read this little incident and still hesitate about going to church . he was also the inventor of a telescope that had a magnifying power of thirty times .
he had never read the lesson which these things conveyed . he had ever mocked and turned away from it ; but , before going down into a hollow place . he looked round , once , upon the evening prospect , sorrowfully . then he went down , down , down , into the dell , it brought him to the wood . a close , thick , shadowy wood .
olga was in the music room when the crowd had congested the [female] . people were introduced to her , and sank down into the nearest chairs , mrs [organization] took up her old place by the keyboard of the piano . everybody seemed to be expecting something , and by degrees the import of their longing was borne in upon [female] . they waited , and waited and waited , much as she had waited for a cigarette the evening before . she looked at the piano , and there was a comfortable murmur from her audience .
in matters of high importance , particularly in cases relating to the game . the justice was not always attentive to these admonitions of his clerk . for , indeed , in executing the laws under that head , many justices of peace suppose they have a large discretionary power . by virtue of which , under the notion of searching for and taking away engines for the destruction of the game . they often commit trespasses , and sometimes felony .
most housemasters feel uneasy in the event of illness in their houses , and mr . [male] was apt to get jumpy beyond the ordinary on such occasions , all that was wrong with macphee . as a matter of fact , was a very fair stomach ache . the direct and legitimate result of eating six buns , half a cocoa nut . three doughnuts , two ices , an apple .
here , if there is such a things as contentment in prison . i was comparatively happy , i nursed the sick and administered medicines under direction of the doctor . i had too , with all easy position , more liberty than any other prisoner . i could go anywhere about the halls and yard . and in a few weeks i was frequently sent on an errand into the town .
who rais would this alarm ? says one of the clergy , and threat'ning severely . cease fighting , i charge ye . a good knotted staff , the full of his hand , instead of the spiradis . back would his command , so falling to thrash , fast as he was able . a trip and a box stretch would him under the table .
the combat was about to become decisive , to entirely glut his vengeance , and to have the young girl witness her lover 's death . vasling had deprived himself of herming 's aid , he could now reckon only on himself . [male] and vasling seized each other by the collar , and held each other with iron grip . one of them must fall , they struck each other violently , the blows were only half parried . for blood soon flowed from both , vasling tried to clasp his adversary about the neck with his arm .
he ought to understand the irrational rapture of that cry of mr. [male] phillips about that bluer blue . that greener green , there is no blue much bluer than reckitt 's blue and no blacking blacker than day and [male] 's . no more emphatic yellow than that of colman 's mustard . if , despite this chaos of color , like a shattered rainbow . the spirit of the small boy is not exactly intoxicated with art and culture .
this book must avoid religion , but there must be many , religious and irreligious . who will concede that this power of answering many purposes was a sort of strength which should not wholly die out of our lives . as a part of personal character , even the moderns will agree that many sidedness is a merit and a merit that may easily be overlooked . this balance and universality has been the vision of many groups of men in many ages . it was the liberal education of [organization] .
apart from his son freddie , whom he had long since dismissed as a youth of abnormal tastes . from whom nothing reasonable was to be expected , he could not imagine anyone not being content merely to be at blandings when the buds were bursting on the trees . a resolute hostess might have saved the situation . but lady [female] abilities in that direction stopped short at leaving everything to mrs. [female] and writing letters in her bedroom . when lady [female] was not writing letters in her bedroom .
was it too late to escape ? perhaps if he did not answer the knock . the blighter might think there was nobody at home . but suppose he opened the door and peeped in ? a spasm of napoleonic strategy seized [male] . he dropped silently to the floor and concealed himself under the desk . napoleon was always doing that sort of thing .
my horse was upon one side of the wall . i upon the other , and the prussians were pouring into the yard , but i was up in an instant and had seized the bridle of the plunging horse over the top of the wall . it was built of loose stones , and i dragged down a few of them to make a gap . as i tugged at the bridle and shouted the gallant creature rose to the leap . and an instant afterward she was by my side and i with my foot on the stirrup .
at the end of twelve minutes and forty seconds you will succeed . the window will slowly go up , and the train will at once enter a tunnel . filling the car and you with coal smoke . in the resulting darkness and confusion you should seize little elmer . throw him quickly out of the open window and make your escape to the gentlemen 's smoking compartment in the rear of your car .
at this point [female] should have slunk away , but the vision revealed by his one available eye hole of the prince standing in a threatening attitude with one arm round joan filled him with a sudden and unaccountable annoyance . he advanced slowly and pugnaciously towards the prince ; and the prince . who had never before acted with [male] in his head ( which was hired for one evening only ) . fled from the stage with a wild yell of fear . the curtain was lowered hastily , there was consternation behind the scenes .
absurd as it may seem , this cursing business operates with a good deal of certainty on the poor negroes . who fall sick instantly on finding the ball of obi , two or three inches in diameter . hidden in their bed , or in the roof , or under the threshold . or in the earthen floor of their huts , the poor wretches become dejected . lose appetite , strength , and spirits .
you better come quiet to my wigwam an see , said red hand darkly , she threw a glance to the bend in the drive behind which lay the house and with a low laugh followed him through the bushes . from one point the drawing room window could be seen . and there the anxious [male] stood , pale with anxiety . stiff and upright in his newly creased trousers ( well turned up to show the new blue socks ) .
the first relieving force failed to relieve , it was under havelock and outram . and arrived when the siege had been going on for three months , it fought its desperate way to lucknow . then fought its way through the city against odds of a hundred to one . and entered the residency ; but there was not enough left of it . then , to do any good , it lost more men in its last fight than it found in the residency when it got in .
`` you take lunch out today , no ? '' said [male] , the head waiter , in his invariable formula . myra and i were alone at breakfast . the first down , i was just putting some honey on to my seventh roll . and was not really in the mood for light conversation with [male] about lunch .
emma denied none of it aloud , and agreed to none of it in private . it was now the middle of june . and the weather fine ; and mrs. [female] was growing impatient to name the day . and settle with mr. [male] as to pigeon pies and cold lamb . when a lame carriage horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty .
`` she knows nothing about it , '' he replied rather crossly , for some unaccountable reason he was angry with himself and with her . shade of [organization] , he looked down at the tempting curve of her red lips . they were round and full and soft as the petals of a half blown rosebud . warm and tender and sweet , with just the least trace of puckering to indicate how they could meet the pressure of other lips .
emma wished she had been alone with mrs. [female] . she should then have heard more : mrs. [female] would speak to her . with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella . and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her . excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge .
i must say that any mention of fixtures has always bored me intensely . when it was a matter of getting a house to live in i was all energy . as soon as [female] had found it , i put my solicitor on to it . and within a month i had signed my name in two places . and was the owner of a highly residential flat in the best part of the neighbourhood .
thus , after having chained in her embrace the two greatest generals that the roman empire had produced . [female] casar and [female] . at the periods when they were respectively arbiters of the world 's fate . perished [female] by her own hand , [female] was a voluptuous and extravagant woman . and in one of the feasts she gave to antony at [location] .
he corrected a good many little abuses in the course of the day . and always without friction -- always with a fine and dainty `` diplomacy '' which left no sting behind . and he got such happiness and such contentment out of these performances that i was obliged to envy him his trade . and perhaps would have adopted it if i could have managed the necessary deflections from fact as confidently with my mouth as i believe i could with a pen . behind the shelter of print , after a little practice .
it was not only on that occasion , it happened at other times . the dog seemed to understand and take a pleasure in it . sometimes meeting a soldier , walking with his sweetheart , [location] , from behind my legs . would bark suddenly , immediately the man would let go the girl and proceed . involuntarily , to perform military tricks , the war office authorities accused me of having trained the dog .
when we would been there four days she got to be on speakin terms with the ladies maid that hung round the lobby and helped put the costumes back on when they slipped off . from this here maid the missus learned who was who , and the information was relayed to me as soon as they was a chance . we would be settin on the porch when i would feel an elbow in my ribs all of a sudden . i would look up at who was passin and then try and pretend i was excited .
twice i took him into the very heart of the little wood beside mother 's house . but it was only a small wood , and somehow he slipped out on the other side . oh , [male] , i had said , how lonely and still it seems in the wood with no one here but ourselves ! do you think , i said , that the birds have souls ? `` i do not know , '' [male] answered , `` let 's get out of this . ''
did i describe the peculiar isolation of that room on the top floor . where the portrait was ? i do not think i did . it was , as a matter of fact . the only room in those parts , for , in the days when he did his amateur painting . old harold was strong on the artistic seclusion business and hated noise .
you may look at it on both sides and hold it up to the light . and pull it to see if it will fray and try if it will spot . but you can not be sure what it will do till after you have worn it a spell . yes , i am [female] to the weddin ' -- i declare . when i think how careless [female] is about little things i can not help mistrusting what kind of a housekeeper she will turn out .
there is another point , the case that was before the general conference of 1876 was a specific case . it was the case of the relation that local preachers sustain to the church . a particular case , this is the principle of all decisions in law . that when a particular case is decided in general terms , the scope and comprehension of the decision must be limited to the particular case itself . and if a court in its decision embraces more than was involved in the particular case .
there was a quick breaking up of the revelry , the broadway pleasure seekers threw off the blight and stormed the assistant director for slips of paper which he was now issuing . [male] gill received one , labelled `` talent check . '' there was fine print upon it which he took no pains to read . beyond gathering its general effect that the victor film art company had the full right to use any photographs of him that its agents might that day have obtained . what engrossed him to the exclusion of this legal formality was the item that he would now be paid seven dollar and fifty cents for his day 's work .
of course , it 's good business . when a fellow has not much behind his forehead , to throw out his chest and attract attention to his shirt front . but as you begin to meet the men who have done something that makes them worth meeting you will find that there are no `` keep off the grass '' or `` beware of the dog '' signs around their premises . and that they do not motion to the orchestra to play slow music while they talk .
as the little vessel approaches [location] the intervening sail hides from my view the figure of the one man i want to see . a boat is lowered from the side of the pilot boat . into which two sailors descend , who on earth is this who steps in after them and takes the rudder lines ? he sports a top hat . kid gloves , and patent shoes .
although large soft beds with curled hair mattresses were in each room . the department issued ticks or sacks to be filled with straw for the use of the soldiers . so that they would not forget that war was a serious matter . nobody used them , but they were there all the same . attached to the moultrie house , and wandering about the back yard .
[female] , the opposing sultan , was a great admirer of [male] . and when the lion hearted king was ill , sent him fruits and even ice . so the historian says , where the saracens got their ice at that time we can only surmise . peace was established , and the pilgrims who desired to enter the holy city were unmolested . this matter was settled in 1192 , on his return [male] was compelled to go incog. through [location] .
in the train mr. [male] told me that the boer jail guards treated the black prisoners . even political ones -- mercilessly , an african chief and his following had been kept there nine months without trial . and during all that time they had been without shelter from rain and sun . he said that one day the guards put a big black in the stocks for dashing his soup on the ground . they stretched his legs painfully wide apart , and set him with his back down hill .
often the features have not quite settled down together in harmony , a mouth . for instance , appearing to have gained such a lead over the rest of a face . that even a mother may fear it can never be overtaken , voices , too . often seem misplaced ; one hears , outside the door , the bass rumble of a sinister giant . and a mild boy , thin as a cricket , walks in .
it is issued by the girl scouts and is very subtle anti man propaganda . i can not find that men are mentioned anywhere in the book . it is given over entirely to telling girls how to chop down trees . tie knots in ropes , and things like that . now , as a man , i am very jealous of my man 's prerogative of chopping down trees and tying knots in ropes .
this fact fully proves , 1 -- that the intervention of maelzel . in performing the moves of the antagonist on the board of the automaton . is not essential to the movements of the automaton , 2 -- that its movements are regulated by mind . by some person who sees the board of the antagonist . 3 -- that its movements are not regulated by the mind of maelzel .
but i did not bring up the little matter you spoke of . not at all , but -- well , it 's all over and it 's all fixed . no scandal , no blackmail , i see ... good thing , for jean rex is not a saint . i suppose you would break off the match , if any telegrams come for me .
we made the usual trip up and down the river . seated in chairs under an awning on the deck of the usual commodious hand propelled ark . made it two or three times , and could have made it with increasing interest and enjoyment many times more . for , of course , the palaces and temples would grow more and more beautiful every time one saw them . for that happens with all such things ; also , i think one would not get tired of the bathers .
with a map of the river before me i proceeded to make some calculations . it was now nearly ten o'clock at night . the launch had had six hours in which to travel at its utmost speed . it was doubtful if so small a vessel could make ten miles an hour . even with the current in its favour , which is rather sluggish because of the locks and the level country .
he wrapped himself in a long black cloak with white whiskers and blue spectacles attached . he entered every saloon in the city . in each of them he drank a glass of rum . in some of them he assumed the disguise of a sailor . in others he entered as a solider .
it is a good speech and will take well , it is also sincere . fellow citizens : you have seen fit to renominate me for the office which i have held one term already , viz . : member of [organization] from this district . as you are aware , i am a self made man , i have carved out my own career from the ground up . as i may say , till today i am your nominee for the second time .
[female] said he did , he professed great scorn of the penalty and the trial . as well as all the other characteristics of `` this miserable half country , '' but he knew . and we knew , that in any `` whole '' country we should never have been as forgivingly treated as we had been here . if the people had come after [location] according to the directions we left . there would have been quite a different story , said [male] , we found out later why no reserve party had arrived .
we ran into [male] and [male] at the lodge gates . i had already telephoned the former to expect us , so as to have everything fall out naturally when the time came . we stopped the car , and descended -- [male] and i . and he walked straight off with [male] , while i side stepped with [female] . she and i were almost too excited to talk , it was now or never .
afterward [male] remembered that first night as a daze of many colours . of quick sensory impressions , of music soft as a voice in love . and of the beauty of things , lights and shadows . and motions and faces , there was a white haired man who stood drinking a many hued cordial from a crystal thimble set on a golden stem . there was a girl with a flowery face .
after reading his strictures i remarked to myself that really there remained but one field of useful popularity for the onion to adorn . in time it might hope to supplant the sunflower as the floral emblem of [location] . as typifying a great political principle which originated in that state : the initiative . when one took a chance and ate a young onion ; the referendum . while one 's digestive apparatus wrestled with it ; the recall .
having decided that wally had swelled head and not feeling much better , mr goble concentrated his attention on the stage . a good deal of action had taken place there during recently concluded business talk . and the unfortunate finchley was back again , playing another of his scenes , mr goble glared at lord finchley . he did not like him , and he did not like the way he was speaking his lines . `` i beg your pardon ? '' said mr. [male] .
he found the door in the basement open . which was fortunate , and slipped quietly through the pantry , intending to reach the [male] by the kitchen stairs . but here another check met him , the glass door which led to the stairs happened to be shut . and he heard voices in the kitchen . which convinced him that if he wished to escape notice he must wait quietly in the darkness until the door was opened for him .
person led the way to the chamber known as `` maisie 's room , '' where the youngest of the machins was wont to sleep in charge of the nurse who . under the supervision of the mother of all three , had dominion over person . ralph and their little sister , the first thing that person noticed was the screen which shut off one of the beds . the unfurling of the four fold screen was always a sure sign that person was taking an infantile illness seriously .
on this occasion , however , reckless of possible injuries to the crease of his trousers . he raced down the road , and turning in at outwood 's gate . bounded upstairs like a highly trained professional athlete , on arriving at the study . his first act was to remove a shoe from the top of the pile in the basket . place it in the small cupboard under the bookshelf .
now , sir , another parallel , you take [location] government just after the war . when the colored people of the south , the freedmen of our land . unable to take care of themselves , their friends . that had fought the battles of the war , in [organization] determined that they should be protected . if no longer by bayonets and cannon .
but he was a domineering husband , as his wife worshipped him . and regarded him as a [location] on earth from whose nod there could be and should be no appeal . but little harm came from this , if a tyrant , he was an affectionate tyrant . his wife felt him to be so , his servants . his parish , and his school all felt him to be so , they obeyed him .
of course , in practice , it works out just the other way . people read a review of an author 's book and are told that it throbs with a passion so intense as almost to be painful . and are on the point of digging seven and sixpence out of their child 's money box to secure a copy . when their eyes fall on the man 's photograph at the side of the review . and they find that he has a face like a rabbit and wears spectacles and a low collar .
i can t say i altogether blame the man ( which is doubtless a great relief to his mind ) . from his point of view , which would be that of the average householder . desiring to take life as lightly as possible , and not that of the old curiosity shop maniac . there is reason on his side , carved oak is very pleasant to look at . and to have a little of , but it is no doubt somewhat depressing to live in .
[female] made a tiger leap at [male] . and landed with his right eye on the right knuckles of the stratford citizen . the quickness and science of the bard was a great surprise to the cambridge athlete . and when time was called he came up groggy with a funeral eye . on the defense , and not on the tiger attack .
what i always say is , you can not beat tact . if you are smooth and tactful you can get folks to do anything you want . but if you just shove your jaw out at them . and order them about , why , then they get their backs up and sauce you . i knew katie well enough to know that she would do anything for andy .
on the doorpost was painted again in large letters , `` offices of the anglo bengalee disinterested loan and life assurance company , '' and on the door was a large brass plate with the same inscription . always kept very bright , as courting inquiry ; staring the city out of countenance after office hours on working days . and all day long on sundays ; and looking bolder than the bank . within , the offices were newly plastered , newly painted , newly papered , newly countered .
kirk lit a fresh cigar and sat thinking . the old feeling of desolation which had attacked him as he came up the bay had returned . he felt like a stranger in a strange world . life was not the same , ruth was not the same , nothing was the same . the more he contemplated the new regulations affecting bill the chillier and more unfriendly did they seem to him .
he grew indifferent to the `` call '' work , and . when an assistant was allowed him to do part of the running for items . it was clear to everybody that presently the assistant would be able to do it all . but there was a pleasant and profitable side to the [location] life . there were real literary people there -- among them a young man .
and now came the climax -- the catastrophe of the drama . as no resistance , beyond whooping and yelling and cock a doodling . was offered to the encroachments of the party without , the ten windows were very speedily . and almost simultaneously , broken in , but i shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with which i gazed . when , leaping through these windows , and down among [location] pele mele .
[female] is far from [location] and knows little about the eminent services performed by her servants there . for it is the newspaper correspondent who makes fame . and he is not sent to [location] but to the continent . to report the doings of the princelets and the dukelets . and where they are visiting and whom they are marrying , often a british official spends thirty or forty years in [location] .
her face radiant with anticipation . the little girl took up her spoon , [female] back in a superior . benevolent manner and watched the smile freeze upon her face and her look of ecstasy change to one of fury . with a horrible suspicion at his heart he seized the spoon she had dropped and took a mouthful himself . when [male] saw him he was leaning against the wall of the white lion .
with due apologies for this impossible table of contents . i tender these tales of the jazz age into the hands of those who read as they run and run as they read . [female] was a jelly bean , i write that again because it has such a pleasant sound . rather like the beginning of a fairy story -- as if [male] were nice . it somehow gives me a picture of him with a round .
this secret band , under its grand marshal , roved over [location] and thrived mightily . each member was as stout hearted a villain as you could see . sometimes their doings came to light , and they were forced to hasten across the borders of an outraged territory into new pastures . yet they fared well in the main , for they could fight and drink and sing . and many a fair one smiled upon them , in spite of their perfectly outrageous morals .
now , if they would only kill the widower over the grave of the wife . the indian 's future would assume a more definite shape . i have once more tried to ride a pair of roller skates . that is the reason i got down on the rink and down on roller skates . that is the reason several people got down on me .
the address which nelly had given her was on the east side of fifth avenue . she made her way along forty second street . it seemed the jolliest , alivest street she had ever encountered . the rattle of the elevated as she crossed sixth avenue was music . and she loved the crowds that jostled her with every step she took .
comes the day before the last day , there is a bustle of getting ready for the landing . customs blanks are in steady demand at the purser 's office . every other person is seeking help from every other person . regarding the job of filling out declarations , the women go about with the guilty look of plotters in their worried eyes . if one of them fails to slip something in without paying duty on it she will be disappointed for life .
seventeen years have gone by since then , and today , in [location] . the streets are a crush of people who are there to honor the remains of the great soldier as they pass to their final resting place under the monument . and the air is heavy with dirges and the boom of artillery . and all the millions of [location] are thinking of the man who restored the union and the flag . and gave to democratic government a new lease of life .
the orchestra paused in the middle of a snort . and the man whose duty it was to swallow the clarionet pulled seven or eight inches of the instrument out of his face and looked wildly around . the gentleman who had been agitating the feelings of the bass viol laid it down on the side . crawled in behind it , and spread a sheet of music over his head . the manager stepped back into the wings for a moment .
winifred was sitting the next afternoon alone in her nursery , trying to play , she was a dear little girl about nine years old . with long , soft , brown hair , a straight little nose , and brown eyes which just then had a wistful . dissatisfied look in them -- for the fact was that . for some reason or other , she could not get on with her dolls at all . the jester was not good-looking enough for her ; they had put his eyes in so carelessly .
well , it is a deep question , deeper than i have got a line to measure . and josiah 's line and mine both tied together do not begin to touch the bottom o not . for we have tried it time and agin . we have argyed aginst each other about it , and jined on and hitched our arguments together . and they did not touch bottom then , nor begin to , as mrs. [female] said ( a woman i set store by .
a prey to these disquieting reflections , [female] lay in the chair for at least an hour . the last rays of a setting sun trembled through the leaves of the tree that shaded the western side of the room . and darkness fell over all ; and with the darkness there came into [male] 's life an experience that scattered his fears of a moment since to the winds . and so tried and exercised his courage , that that fast fading quality gained a renewed strength for the fearful battle with a supernatural foe . in which he had , out of his goodness of heart .
to be a relative of the king in those good old days was generally fatal . let [location] rejoice that times have so greatly improved . and that the wicked monarch has learned to seat himself gingerly upon his bomb infested throne . [male] called the miserable monarch to account for the death of [male] . and , as a result , [male] lost his french possessions .
there was more money in the business than one knew what to do with , as it extended . i brought out a line of goods suitable for kings . and a nobby thing for duchesses and that sort . with ruffles down the forehatch and the running gear clewed up with a featherstitch to leeward and then hauled aft with a back stay and triced up with a half turn in the standing rigging forward of the weather gaskets . yes , it was a daisy , but about that time i noticed that the motive power had taken to standing on one leg .
june 16 , mr. [male] gave [location] a delightful bed . and we surely had a good night 's rest . but not sleep -- we were too happy to sleep ; would keep the reality and not let it turn to a delusion . dreaded that we might wake up and find ourselves in the boat again . it is an amazing adventure , there is nothing of its sort in history that surpasses it in impossibilities made possible .
in the morning i was awakened very early by the light streaming in the window . the blinds of which i had left open the night before . the air was alive with bird songs , and the eastern sky was flushing with tints which no painter 's canvas ever caught . but ante sunrise skies and songs are not fit subjects for the continued contemplation of men who read until midnight . so i hastily closed the blinds , drew the shade , dropped the curtains and lay down again .
`` do not mention it , '' said [female] from which conversation it will be seen that [female] 's was gradually pulling itself together . it had been asleep for years , it was now waking up . when the winter term ended , there were distinct symptoms of an outbreak of public spirit in the house . [male] was no longer head of [male] 's . he was now head of dencroft 's .
for good results one must begin even sooner , here , for example , are the directions . as i interpret them , for growing asparagus . having secured a suitable piece of ground , preferably a deep friable loam rich in nitrogen . go out three years ago and plough or dig deeply , remain a year inactive , thinking . two years ago pulverize the soil thoroughly , wait a year .
[female] had spread herself upon the supper . there was a small cold chicken that seemed desirous of shrinking within itself . a salad in a glass bowl . with a nickel silver fork and spoon adorned with blue [location] handles . a plate of ham well garnished with parsley .
a few steps took him to the railings that bounded the college grounds . it was late august , and the evenings had begun to close in . the cricket field looked very cool and spacious in the dim light , with the school buildings looming vague and shadowy through the slight mist . the little gate by the railway bridge was not locked . he went in , and walked slowly across the turf towards the big clump of trees which marked the division between the cricket and football fields .
gneisenau , the chief of the staff . had lingered behind for an instant , and he laid his hand upon one of the aides de camp . the fellow had attracted my attention , for i have always a quick eye for a fine man . he was tall and slender , the very model of a horseman . indeed , there was something in his appearance which made it not unlike my own .
this , however , did but evoke a fresh flood of tears , mrs. [female] had a keen sense of the deportment owed to tragedy . [female] , by bickering with [female] , had thrown away the advantage she had gained by fainting . mrs. [female] was not going to let her retrieve it by shining as a consoler . i hasten to add that this resolve was only sub conscious in the good woman . her grief was perfectly sincere , and it was not the less so because with it was mingled a certain joy in the greatness of the calamity .
he hates to have it wept on by a client who has jewed him down to half price . and then insisted on coming in to sob with him in the morning before he has swept the office floor . one time she came and sobbed on my shoulder . her tears are of the warm , damp kind . and feel disagreeable as they roll down the neck of a comparative stranger .
but he could not get a word of forgiveness out of her . she simply sobbed and sniffed in a subdued but wholly unappeasable way for two long hours . meantime crowding the man more than ever with her undertaker furniture and paying no sort of attention to his frequent and humble little efforts to do something for her comfort . then the train halted at the italian line and she hopped up and marched out of the car with as firm a leg as any washerwoman of all her tribe ! and how sick i was , to see how she had fooled me .
now today even [female] will admit , if you get him in a corner . that truth is the mightiest warrior of them all . the only trouble is his truancy , sometimes he can not be found for centuries . then he will [male] up unexpectedly , break a few heads . and skip away , nothing can stand against him , [male] 's best ally .
but with genuine pleasure , -- how her strong lips would part slightly and disclose sweet lines not displayed when she held her features well in hand . i -- i , a clear headed , driving , successful salesman of white goods . actually wished i might be divested of all nineteenth century abilities and characteristics , and be one of those fairies that only silly girls and crazy poets think of . and might , unseen , behold the meeting of my flowers with this highly cultivated specimen of the only sort of flowers our cities produce . what flower did she most resemble ? a [female] , no .
business promoters called upon [male] . his name was put down as a director of several leading companies . and it was rumoured that in the event of his acquittal he would undertake a merger of all the great burglar protection corporations of [location] . the trial opened a week later , and lasted two months . [male] was indicted on five charges -- arson , for having burned the steel cage of the elevator .
but only apparently ; she had been there nine years , and was eighteen when she entered . she was a commoner , and had been sent here on her bridal night by sir breuse sance pite . a neighboring lord whose vassal her father was . and to which said lord she had refused what has since been called le droit du seigneur . and , moreover , had opposed violence to violence and spilt half a gill of his almost sacred blood .
that is to say , he hunts for a place where the carpet is loose along the chancel rail . finds it where two lengths join . deftly turns up a flap , spits upon the bare floor . and then lets the flap fall back , finally giving it a pat with the sole of his foot . this done , he and his assistant leave the church to the sexton .
this , dear young friends , is the short and simple annal of my start in journalism . and you will see that the pathway is equally open to you . skulls piled roof high in the vault beneath the church tower supply the only show thing hythe possesses . there is some doubt as to their precise nationality , but of their existence there can be none . as any visitor to the town may see for himself on payment of sixpence .
years ago i can remember when i used to ride in a caboose and enjoy myself . and before good fortune had made me the target of the alert and swift flying whisk broom of the palace car . it was my chief joy to catch a freight over the hill from cheyenne . on the mountain division , we were not due anywhere until the following day . and so at the top of the mountain we would cut off the caboose and let the train go on .
little did i think the change was a fable , i had not long to wait to find i had been utterly deceived . according to mr. [male] , his reason for his stopping his expensive paper was not as stated ! as soon as i discovered this i called together my friends . and as they would have to supply a huge capital to carry on the budget . and as i had been deceived , it was arranged that they should retire with their unused capital .
it would be a violation of the guarantees of personal liberty . a holding of the just rights of the laity of the church . we can not exclude them from membership in the general conference . except by directing the annual conferences to vote on the question of their exclusion . are we ready to send that question in that form down to the annual conferences for their action ?
whenever mr. [male] crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth . and , poised in the middle of them , windy corner , he laughed . the situation was so glorious , the house so commonplace , not to say impertinent . the late mr. [male] had affected the cube . because it gave him the most accommodation for his money .
you are dressing , when you hear a grunt behind you . next there is a cackle , and you see the neck of an old hen stretched round the corner . while you are dressing various shock heads peer in at the door . they evidently regard the room as a temporary menagerie . you can not tell whether the heads belong to boys or girls .
i went into the building and registered , and then from force of habit or absent mindedness handed my umbrella over the counter and asked how soon supper would be ready . everybody registers , but very few , i am told , ask how soon supper will be ready . the old south is now run on the european plan , however , the old meeting house is chiefly remarkable for the associations that cluster around it . two centuries hover about the ancient weather vane and look down upon the visitor when the weather is favorable . [male] was baptized and attended worship here , prior to his wonderful invention of lightning .
this was said as seriously as the circumstance demanded ; but my wife turned it off with a laugh . and i said no more , always trusting to her intuitions in these matters . she was right , she would not have been received , and a cool `` not at home '' would have been a bitter social pill to [location] if we had gone out of our way to be courteous . i saw a great deal of our neighbors , nevertheless .
motty , the son , was about twenty three , tall and thin and meek looking , he had the same yellow hair as his mother . but he wore it plastered down and parted in the middle . his eyes bulged , too , but they were not bright , they were a dull grey with pink rims . his chin gave up the struggle about half-way down . and he did not appear to have any eyelashes , a mild , furtive , sheepish sort of blighter , in short .
they were calling him , with all poor men . to the sweat shop and the forge , to the great mill of life . the new era had begun , dawning bright and clear to disperse the gloom in his soul . leaning against the casement and wondering where he could earn the first dollar for the peggy [male] that was peggy gray . he rose to meet it with a fine unflinching fearlessness .
she made no apology for her lateness . to mr. [female] one of the most remarkable points about the dinner was the peculiar metamorphosis of mrs. [female] from the brooding silent woman he had known to the gracious and considerate hostess . [female] appeared also to be overcome with surprise , so much so that he was unable to keep his astonishment to himself . he had come prepared to endure a dull evening absorbed in grim silence . and he found himself instead opposite a bottle of champagne of a brand and year which commanded his utmost respect .
the title of doctor is so common in the house that one may almost say that the deputy who does not bear it is by that reason conspicuous . i am assured that it is not a self granted title . and not an honorary one , but an earned one ; that in austria it is very seldom conferred as a mere compliment . that in austria the degrees of doctor of music . doctor of philosophy , and so on , are not conferred by the seats of learning .
how they were born , or with what parentage , is in many cases a question to which the records of the institution supply no answer . they were simply `` found '' on a doorstep , or arrested when wandering about the street crying for the mother or the father who had cast them off . this class of school girl is generally distinguished by the fineness of her christian name . blanche , and [female] , and constance . being among the waifs and strays who have found a refuge with the kindly matron of the field lane institution .
there is a big central pavilion and on each side wings . each terminating in a pavilion joined by tall marble columns . the ruff is surrounded by a balustrade ornamented by vases and beautiful statutes . the same balustrade extends the hull length of the building below . five hundred and thirty four feet , and below it stretches the beautiful garden .
[male] , a most interesting speaker , who reduced his fee ( as the thing was a war charity ) . by one half , leaving it at three hundred dollar . unhappily the weather was against us , it was too fine . our members scarcely care to listen to lectures in fine weather . and it turned out that our members are not interested in what will come after the war .
he fitfully threw his saber , it missed and went round the sun . he followed no further , he was not rash , but the baby held on to my coarse moustache . and seemed to enjoy the fun , in saving that blue eyed baby from the gardens of grizzly gru . i suffered a terrible shock and fright . but the doctor believes it will be all right , and he thinks he can pull me through .
he was so absorbed in acquiring wealth that he worked night and day to accomplish his end . by this means he lost his health , he became a nervous wreck . and was so irritable and irascible that his wife ceased to live with him and returned to her parents ', house . although his wife had loved him fondly , she could not continue her affection toward one who could not support her . so she left him and returned to her childhood 's home .
terrible in their wrath , the boy scouts never forget kindness . the whistle of a striped [male] sounded softly in the darkness . the sentry , who was pacing to and fro before the camp fire , halted , and peered into the night . as he peered , he uttered the plaintive note of a zebra calling to its mate . a voice from the darkness said , `` een [location] . ''
i was agreeable to that , too , so he called the chauffeur and the chauffeur disentangled his whiskers from the steering gear and came and joined us . the chauffeur and i each had a small glass of light wine . but the general took brandy , then ensued a spirited dialogue between him and the woman who kept the shop . assuming that i had no interest in the matter . i studied the pictures behind the bar , presently , having reduced the woman to a state of comparative silence .
the english minister at a foreign court labors under one great disadvantage . which is , that his policy , and all the consequences that are to follow it . are rarely , if ever , shaped with any reference to the state of matters then existing in his own country . absorbed as he is in great european questions , how can he follow with sufficient attention the course of events at home . or recognize , in the signs and tokens of the division list .
well , before long here comes the wreck , dim and dusky . sliding along down , a kind of cold shiver went through me . and then i struck out for her , she was very deep , and i see in a minute there war not much chance for anybody being alive in her . i pulled all around her and hollered a little , but there was not any answer . all dead still , i felt a little bit heavy hearted about the gang , but not much .
he may have meant to be funny , or he may not , some of those standing near took him one way . others the other , some gravely bowed their heads , others burst into guffaws , the g.m . often puzzled his staff in that way , all were anxious to do the right thing by him . but he made it so difficult to tell what the right thing was . but , as i went down the basement stairs to change my coat in the clerks
in [location] , mind you . the newsboys do not shout their extras , they bear in their hands placards with black typed announcements of the big news story of the day . and even these headings seem designed to soothe rather than to excite -- saying , for example . such things as special from liner , in referring to a disaster at sea . and meeting in ulster , when meaning that the northern part of [location] has gone on record as favoring civil war before home rule .
such were the meditations of mr. [male] . and , on the final fall of the curtain , amid unrestrained enthusiasm on the part of the audience . he had despatched messengers in all directions with instructions to find mr. [male] and conduct him to the presence . meanwhile , he waited impatiently on the empty stage , the sudden advent of wally mason . who appeared at this moment , upset mr. [male] terribly .
he said he could do the thing . and would , for me , with the help two men and a boy . if he was alluding to the clearing up of the victuals and drink . i think he was making an under estimate . but possibly he may have been speaking of the sailing of the yacht .
having had her say with her dear friend or her dear enemy . as the case may be , our heroine proceeds to the corner and hails a passing street car . because her heels are so high and her skirts are so snug , she takes about twice the time to climb aboard that a biped in trousers would take . into the car she comes , teetering and swaying , the car is no more than comfortably filled . true , all the seats at the back where she has entered are occupied .
personally , i have always defended you , but i must say it 's getting too much for me . all the boys at the athletic club and the boosters are sore , the way you go on deliberately touting doane and his bunch of hell hounds . and talking about being liberal -- which means being wishy washy -- and even saying this preacher guy ingram is not a professional free love artist . and then the way you been carrying on personally , [male] says he saw you out the other night with a gang of totties .
today i am getting better ideas about distances . i was so eager to get hold of every pretty thing that i giddily grabbed for it . sometimes when it was too far off , and sometimes when it was but six inches away but seemed a foot . alas , with thorns between , i learned a lesson . also i made an axiom , all out of my own head -- my very first one .
the proof of his disappearance was easy to find , as soon as i dared do so with discretion i ventured upon a few inquiries . the fact that he had been engulfed while still owing four months rent for his rooms , and that he had vanished without even having time to pay such bills as he had outstanding with local tradesmen . showed that he must have been devisualised at a moment 's notice . the awful fear that i might be held accountable for his death .
so with penrod , he had vital need of a letter . and there before his eyes , upon [male] 's desk . was apparently the precise thing he needed , from below rose the voice of his mother urging him to the breakfast table . warning him that he stood in danger of tardiness at school . he was pressed for time , and acted upon an inspiration that failed to prompt him even to read the letter .
he was drunk , and weaving about in his saddle . he was over fifty year old , and had a very red face . everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him . and he sassed back , and said he would attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns . but he could not wait now because he would come to town to kill old colonel sherburn .
george 's request for a lonely furnished cottage somewhere in the neighbourhood of the castle did not . as he had feared , strike the belpher house agent as the demand of a lunatic . every well-dressed stranger who comes to belpher is automatically set down by the natives as an artist . for the picturesqueness of the place has caused it to be much infested by the brothers and sisters of the brush . in asking for a cottage , indeed , [male] did precisely as belpher society expected him to do .
`` supper 's ready , miss , '' then she saw [location] and looked frightened . and motioned me to come to her , which i did , and she asked if we had told about the cat . i said no , and she was relieved , and said please do not . for if miss marget knew , she would think it was an unholy cat and would send for a priest and have its gifts all purified out of it . and then there would not be any more dividends , so i said we would not tell .
from thecharles hotel where we stopped ,charles street seemed ablaze and alive all night . and densely thronged all day , sunday brought no rest , for sunday . so far as military parades , amusement and general gaiety were concerned . was the liveliest day in the week ; and sunday night the theatres were sure to present their best performances and to draw their largest audiences . and so , from morning till night .
but a lot of women will go right ahead without any preliminaries and wonder what 's the matter when the walls begin to crack and tumble about their ears . i never come across a case of this sort without thinking of [male] . whose father died about ten years ago and left [male] a million dollar . and left me as trustee of both until [male] reached his twenty fifth birthday . i did not relish the job particularly , because [male] was one of these charlotte russe boys .
on the 21st of july , 1861 , occurred the battle of bull run . under the joint management of general irwin [organization] and general person . after a sharp conflict , the confederates were repulsed , but rallied again under general person . called thereafter stonewall jackson , while the federals were striving to beat jackson back . troops under generals early and person from [location] junction were hurled against their flank .
with the exception of mr abney and glossop . a dismal man of nerves and mannerisms . the only person with whom i exchanged speech on my first evening was white , the butler . there are some men one likes at sight . white was one of them , even for a butler he was a man of remarkably smooth manners .
it was a sad change , they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival . certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks , indescribable spirit . the idea , the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought . the assurance of his attentions , his liveliness , his manners ! it had been a very happy fortnight , and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of hartfield days .
fortune was with him , on the dressing table . together with a bunch of keys and some small change . lay a brown leather pocketbook , evidently sir [male] did not share lady blunt 's impression that the world was waiting for a chance to rob him as soon as his back was turned . spennie opened the pocketbook , and counted the contents . there were two ten pound notes , and four of five pounds , he took a specimen of each variety .
he explained that he was the hotel 's detective . and had been on the city 's police force . in both places he had dealings with a confidence man . called presidio -- after the part of the city he came from . presidio was an odd lot ; had enough skill in several occupations to earn honest wages .
two delegates to the general convocation of the sons of ice water were sitting in the lobby of the windsor . in the city of [location] , not long ago , strangers to each other and to everybody else . one came from huerferno county , and the other was a delegate from the ice water encampment of correjos county . from the beautiful billiard person came the sharp rattle of person balls . and in the bar room there was a glitter of electric light .
unconscious of the embarrassment she had caused in these several masculine minds . the swedish lady named [female] led the party onward . continuing her agricultural lecture , [male] walked mechanically , his eyes averted and looking at no one . and throughout this agony he was burningly conscious of the blasphemed presence of miss pratt beside him . therefore , it was with no little surprise , when the party came out of the barn .
with his waving flame he lit the punk . a firecracker caught a spark , -- then rockets and wheels and bombs went off . no longer the place was dark , the explosions made a fearful noise . the flames leaped high and higher , the village folk awoke and cried . `` the town [male] is on fire ! ''
i can not conclude these details of some very singular passages in a life at all times sufficiently eventful . without again recalling to the attention of the reader the merits of that indiscriminate philosophy which is a sure and ready shield against those shafts of calamity which can neither be seen . felt nor fully understood , it was in the spirit of this wisdom that . among the ancient hebrews , it was believed the gates of heaven would be inevitably opened to that sinner . or saint , who , with good lungs and implicit confidence .
`` take your own way ; i promise nothing , '' said the duke , haughtily . and , with a motion of his hand , dismissed his adviser . some of these studios are of imposing size and vast proportions . and not devoid of a certain architectural pretension , -- a group , a figure . or a bas relief usually adorning the space over the door , and by its subject giving some indication of the tastes of the proprietor .
so , finally , he found himself reduced to a bare palace . containing only a big mahogany bedstead that he slept in . a small stool on which he sat to pull off his shoes and the moth eaten ermine robe . in this straight he was reduced to the necessity of borrowing an occasional dime from his chief counselor . with which to buy a ham sandwich , and the chief counselor had not many dimes .
but as i was almost choked with the water that got into it . i shut it again , and made an effort to reach the land . to my surprise i found that , by moving my paws and legs . i not only got my head well above the water . but was able to guide myself to the bank , on to which i at length dragged myself .
partridge fell trembling on his knees , and begged for mercy . vowing he had meant no harm -- when [male] . after staring wildly on him for a moment , quitted his hold . and discharged a rage on himself , that , had it fallen on the other . would certainly have put an end to his being , which indeed the very apprehension of it had almost effected .
with which [male] quixote was satisfied , observing that the pagan had acted discreetly . and in imitation of the beaver , which , when closely pursued by the hunters . tears off with his teeth that which it knows by instinct to be the object of pursuit . he ordered sancho to take up the helmet ; who , holding it in his hand . said , before heaven , the basin is a special one , and is well worth a piece of eight .
she comes into the drawing room cleaning boots . she has her own method of cleaning them , too . she rubs off the mud , puts on the blacking . and polishes up all with the same brush , they take an enormous amount of polishing . she seems to do nothing else all day long but walk about shining one boot .
`` earlier than that , '' amended mr. [male] , so kirk settled down to a routine of hard work . and , so doing , drove another blow at the wedge which was separating his life from [male] 's . there were days now when they did not meet at all , and others when they saw each other for a few short moments in which neither seemed to have much to say . [female] had made a perfunctory protest against the new departure . and she had gone on to speak of other subjects , it was plain to kirk that his absence scarcely affected her .
for many are classed as laymen for the purposes of lay representation . and have to do with it officially as laymen , yet themselves are ineligible as delegates . well , in this case , we have the episcopal board over against the editor . both are right and both are wrong , the editor is right when he said of a woman . if she be a lay member her right is clear as that of any duly elected man .
i have learned a number of things . and am educated , now , but i was not at first , i was ignorant at first . at first it used to vex me because , with all my watching . i was never smart enough to be around when the water was running uphill ; but now i do not mind it . i have experimented and experimented until now i know it never does run uphill , except in the dark .
meantime , watch for a sign from me . eight days from now , we shall be wide asunder . for i shall be on the border of the pacific . and you far out on the atlantic , approaching england . that day , if i am alive and my sublime discovery is proved and established .
glover 's , 11.15 just arrived , village deserted , except sick and aged , elephant passed through three quarters of an hour ago . the anti temperance mass meeting was in session ; he put his trunk in at a window and washed it out with water from cistern . some swallowed it -- since dead ; several drowned , detectives cross and o'shaughnessy were passing through town . but going south -- so missed elephant , whole region for many miles around in terror . people flying from their homes , wherever they turn they meet elephant .
when people do not respect [location] we are sharply offended . yet deep down in his private heart no man much respects himself . pudd'nhead [male] 's new calendar , necessarily , the human interest is the first interest in the log book of any country . the annals of tasmania , in whose shadow we were sailing . are lurid with that feature , tasmania was a convict dump .
the customer departed , leaving this fond mother engaged in an active skirmish with the two children . both of whom finally escaped into the street with great howlings , madame lane does a good business . she says that in pleasant weather she has from twenty five to fifty calls a day , mostly women . but in bad weather not more than fifteen or twenty , and these of the other sex . many of these come only to learn lucky numbers for lottery gambling .
and , followed by the vizier , the king made his way into the garden . the vizier was now in a state of some apprehension . he was exercised in his mind as to the effect which the embracing of a new religion by the king might have on the formidable church party . it would be certain to cause displeasure among the priesthood . and in those days it was a ticklish business to offend the priesthood .
i am far from saying that the kind of interest of which i am speaking . and of which i intend to deprive myself , -- is not the most natural and the most efficacious . what would the `` black dwarf '' be if every one knew from the beginning that he was a rich man and a baronet ? or `` the pirate , '' if all the truth about norna of the fitful head had been told in the first chapter ? therefore , put the book down if the revelation of some future secret be necessary for your enjoyment .
while our friend stood frozen for an instant by his astonishment . the queer figure in the airy car tipped the vehicle almost upside down by leaping over the side of it . seemed to slide or drop down the rope like a monkey , and alighted seated on the edge of the wall . over which he kicked and dangled his legs as he grinned at [male] . the wind roared in the trees yet more ruinous and desolate .
the mill of our vile contemporaries at herculaneum is an old one that was used around naples one hundred years ago to smash rock for the neapolitan road . and is entirely out of repair , it was also used in a brick yard here near pompeii . then an old junk man sold it to a tenderfoot from jerusalem as an ice-cream freezer . he found that it would not work , and so used it to grind up potato bugs for blisters . now it is grinding ostensible flour at herculaneum .
the classes had swelled prodigiously , for practically all riseholmites now were at some stage of instruction . with the exception of hermy and ursy . who pronounced the whole thing `` piffle , '' and , as gentle chaff for georgie . sometimes stood on one leg in the middle of the lawn and held their breath . then hermy would say one , two , three , and they shouted `` om '' at the tops of their discordant voices .
and here in this buildin we see everything relating to schools from kindergarten to university . training schools , where children wuz to work . schools for the blind , deaf and dumb in operation . the work of labratories going on before you . departments in drawing , music , agricultural colleges .
r. finally lost her money , and with it her friends . ambition : the man of the hour . epitaph : when she had it she spent it . [female] , dutch painter who specialized in portraits of old ladies and [male] . also brought considerable fame down upon himself by filling a museum in amsterdam with tourist drawing paintings .
paul had been careful , whilst in the hearing of his friends . to give the cabman a fictitious address , but as soon as he reached the euston road . he stopped the man and ordered him to put him down at the church near the south end of westbourne terrace . for he dared not drive up openly to his own door , at last he found himself standing safely on the pavement . looking down the long line of yellow lamps of his own terrace .
once more on the deck i stand of my own swift gliding craft , set sail ! farewell to the land , the gale follows fair abaft . we shoot through the sparkling foam like an ocean bird set free . like the ocean bird , our home we will find far out on the sea . the land is no longer in view , the clouds have begun to frown .
this was more than could be borne , and miss [female] hastily interrupted , au reservoir . diva dear , she said with extreme acerbity . and diva 's feet began swiftly revolving again , the problem about the bridge party thus seemed to be solved . the two poppits , the two bartletts , the major and the [female] with diva darling and herself made eight . and miss [female] with a sudden recrudescence of indignation against [female] with regard to the red currant fool and the belated invitation .
this school is founded firmly on four years of war . when at the age of eighteen you are suddenly given a cheque book and called `` sir , '' you must do something by way of acknowledgment . a pipe in the mouth makes it clear that there has been no mistake . you are undoubtedly a man , but you may be excused for feeling after the first pipe that the joys of smoking have been rated too high .
you should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down in that water and kiss it . kiss it , and pet it . and fondle it , and talk to it as if it were alive . and welcome it back with the dear names they gave their darlings . just as if it had been a friend who was long gone away and lost .
they all shuddered at the threat , for here they had a good home . and a new one was likely to be a change for the worse . the denial was general , none had stolen anything . not money , anyway -- a little sugar , or cake , or honey . or something like that , that [female] percy would not mind or miss
she walked on , aimlessly , presently she came to [location] circle . and , crossing broadway at the point where that street breaks out into an eruption of automobile stores . found herself suddenly hungry , opposite a restaurant whose entire front was a sheet of plate glass . on the other side of this glass , at marble topped tables . apparently careless of their total lack of privacy , sat the impecunious , lunching , their every mouthful a spectacle for the passer-by .
but if he sounds like something heavy , such as a log of wood . or a piece of meat , or a visitor . he is interrogated , and then bidden or forbidden to ascend , the ground floor and the upper floor of that battered house are alike deserted . and the inmates keep the central portion , just as in a dying body all life retires to the heart . there is a door at the top of the first flight of stairs .
herr slossenn boschen accompanied himself . the prelude did not suggest a comic song exactly , it was a weird , soulful air . it quite made one 's flesh creep ; but we murmured to one another that it was the german method . and prepared to enjoy it , i noticed , as the song progressed . that a good many other people seemed to have their eye fixed on the two young men .
this fact being confirmed by the stranger , [female] rafael resolved to go on . they entered the wood , and had not advanced far , when they came upon the persons who had been robbed . and who were more than forty in number , the man who had been left free . had unbound some of them ; but his work was not yet complete , and several of them were still tied to the trees . they presented a strange spectacle , some of them stripped naked .
but how like a barn , and how very cold , of course , it contained frescoes by [female] . in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper . but who was to tell her which they were ? she walked about disdainfully , unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date . there was no one even to tell her which , of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts . was the one that was really beautiful , the one that had been most praised by mr. [male] .
if [location] was astonished , he was not the less pleased at all this , he encouraged glencore 's sense of gratification by every means in his power . and gladly lent himself to all the petty anxieties about dress and appearance in which he seemed now immersed . nothing could exceed , indeed , the care he bestowed on these small details . ever insisting as he did that , his majesty being the best-dressed gentleman in [location] . these matters assumed a greater importance in his eyes .
the majority of those i sketched were hardly human , [male] was right -- i would find such characters there not to be found in all the world over , and i have not , the people got on my overstrung youthful nerves . i left the country the moment i had sufficient material for my sketches . i had shaken off the unpleasant feeling of being murdered in the river .
there still come days in the spring when the country seems to get a stranglehold on me and start in pulling . this particular day had been one of them , i got up in the morning and looked out of the window . and the breeze just wrapped me round and began whispering about pigs and chickens . and when i went out on fifth avenue there seemed to be flowers everywhere , i headed for the park . and there was the grass all green , and the trees coming out , and a sort of something in the air .
your enemy keeps clear of you , he neither grants nor claims favors . he awards you your rights . no more , no less , -- and demands the same from you , consequently there is no friction . your friend , on the contrary , is continually getting himself tangled up with you `` because he is your friend . '' i have heard that shelley was never better pleased than when his associates made free with his coats .
then he dropped down and went to sleep again ; but what he had been saying give me the very idea i wanted . i says to myself , i can fix it now so nobody wo not think of following me . about twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank . the river was coming up pretty fast , and lots of driftwood going by on the rise . by and by along comes part of a log raft .
but there was one habit of my bat 's -- a weakness of old age . i admit , but not the less annoying -- about which it was my duty to let all the world know . one 's grandfather may have a passion for the gum on the back of postage stamps . and one hushes it up ; but if he be deaf the visitor must be warned . my bat had a certain looseness in the shoulder .
has won the love of her teacher and schoolmates by her amiable deportment and faithful application to her various studies . thus we learn that little [male] 's sister . eight years older than himself , attended the same school . and that she was a good pupil , if any such reward of merit was ever conferred on little [male] . it has failed to come to light , if he won the love of his teacher and playmates .
and indeed that boy , [male] , and his sisters mollie and sallie . were wondering where squinty was , they saw the open door of the pen . and the boy recalled that he had forgotten to lock it . `` oh , squinty is gone , '' he cried , and he felt very badly indeed . but i have no time to tell you more of that boy now .
to me the statement that tobacco tainted human flesh is offensive to the cannibal does not come home with crushing power . perhaps i do not love my fellow man so well as the cannibal does , i know that i am selfish in this way . and if my cannibal brother desires to polish my wishbone he must take me as he finds me . i can not abstain wholly from the use of tobacco in order to gratify the pampered tastes of one who has never gone out of his way to do me a favor . do i ask the cannibal to break off the pernicious use of tobacco because i dislike the flavor of it in his brisket ?
mrs. [male] made an attempt to arrest him . but he escaped without a word and went on very quickly , his wife had behaved generously about mrs. [female] . the sight of the woman brought that truth to his mind . he was aware of that , but no generosity on the part of the wife . no love , no temper , no virtue .
you want to be in good health to play the bagpipes . strangers were allowed three guesses , and most of them guessed a different tune each time . [male] was disagreeable after supper , —i think it must have been the stew that had upset him . he is not used to high living , —so [male] and i left him in the boat . and settled to go for a mouch round henley , he said he should have a glass of whisky and a pipe .
the lovers were standing together at one of the windows , it had a most favourable aspect . and , for half a minute , emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . but it would not do ; he had not come to the point . he had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told harriet that he had seen them go by . and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt .
jambres , with the feline agility of a catapult of the mountain . began to climb the perpendicular leaden channel to which he had called our attention . and of course we had to follow him . it was perfectly marvellous to see the ease and grace with which he skipped and hopped up the seemingly naked face of the wall . there were places indeed where our position was perilous enough , and it did not add to our cheerfulness to hear the horrid roaring and gurgling of the unseen and imprisoned waters that poured down the channel with a violence which seemed as if they might at any moment burst their bonds .
the face in the drawing was everything . and i had taken the greatest pains to depict in the distorted features all the authoress desired . in fact , i was rather proud of it . the authoress was pleased , and the block was sent to the engraver . i was then about twenty -- photographing a drawing on to wood was unknown .
`` it must have been , '' said nellie , in an inscrutable voice , she rose and gathered together her paraphernalia . and he saw that she was wearing the damnable white apron . the close atmosphere of the home enveloped and stifled him once more . how different was this exasperating interior from the large jolly freedom of the empire music [male] . and from the whisky , cigarettes and masculinity of that private room at the [male] 's head !
but then the business of the day as regarded the cedars began . for [male] , before he went to bed . told both his father and his mother the whole story . the story , that is , as far as the money was concerned , and also as far as [male] 's conduct to him was concerned . but of his own feelings towards her he said nothing .
saying , hark ye squire . i miss several crown pieces which i had but just now , this so amazed the country man . that he began to mumble with the crown pieces in his mouth . whereupon the student said , i verily beleeve the villain hath them in his mouth . the country man answered thereupon .
i presume i could convince him if i had time enough . but we are busy creeters , [male] and i . both on us , and id'no as he would have time to argy back and forth with me . but it would be well for him if he did . men must have wimmen advise em if they ever expect to amount to anything .
`` there , there , '' said the baron , and cleared his throat , then he kissed her . where were firmness and dignity now ? he let her push him into the chimney corner . and down into a seat ; and then what did this sly , shocking girl do but sit on his knee and tell him nobody ever had such a papa before . and she could never possibly love any one half so much as she loved him . and were not he and she going to have a merry christmas tomorrow ?
in which the author himself makes his appearance on the stage . for such was the compassion which inhabited mr allworthy 's mind . that nothing but the steel of justice could ever subdue it . to be unfortunate in any respect was sufficient , if there was no demerit to counterpoise it . to turn the scale of that good man 's pity .
no , but she caught cold , went to the theatre last night and caught a cold . so she wired me -- naturally ; got the habit of telling me her troubles . can not break it , even in reno , so she does . but i am fond of it ; she went for my sake . she 's got the habit of sacrificing herself for me .
at this moment a small bantam wearing one eye still in mourning danced up and kicked [female] 's eye out . then another rival knocked the stuffing for a whole sofa pillow out of [male] , and retired . by this time the surprised and gratified hens stepped back and gave the boys a chance . the bantam now put on his trim little telegraph climbers and . going up mr. [male] 's powerful frame at about four jumps .
the next step i took was to disband that legion of supernumerary domestics . who had preyed so long upon the vitals of my friend : , a parcel of idle drones . so intolerably insolent , that they even treated their own master with the most contemptuous neglect . they had been generally hired by his wife , according to the recommendation of her woman . and these were the only patrons to whom they payed the least deference .
and taking one each end of the ample settee , we kept [female] company . to hanover one should go , they say , to learn the best german , the disadvantage is that outside hanover . which is only a small province , nobody understands this best german , thus you have to decide whether to speak good german and remain in hanover . or bad german and travel about , [location] being separated so many centuries into a dozen principalities . is unfortunate in possessing a variety of dialects , germans from posen wishful to converse with men of wurtemburg .
in this situation black [male] found his family . when he came home for the purpose before mentioned . as his wife and three daughters were all of them talking together . and most of them crying , it was some time before he could get an opportunity of being heard . but as soon as such an interval occurred , he acquainted the company with what sophia had said to him .
at mr. [male] 's own house , the night mr. [male] dined with him . a copy of punch was lying on the table . containing a rare thing for punch -- a supplement . in this case it took the shape of my caricatures of the royal academy , 1889 . just as dinner was announced mr. [male] saw the paper .
`` yes , '' she replied , as she tore open the door . `` and perhaps i will never come back again , '' and with a bang that shook the house she was gone . she took a tram to hammersmith on her way to see her niece , [female] dixon . she was angry ; the day had been one of continual annoyances and vexations . entering the car she buried her elbows deep into the redundant figure of a woman who was also endeavouring to enter .
black and white men have to introduce so many characters into their work . they are obliged to invent them ; but it is a curious fact that this facility disappears at times . the late mr. [male] , clever as he was at inventing character for his black and white work . found , when he was painting in oil , that confidence had left him . and he spent several days wandering about [location] to find real characters for a picture he was painting representing the jury in `` pilgrim 's progress . ''
the hours of parisian gaiety are late , ordinary dinner is eaten at about seven o'clock . but fashionable dinners begin at eight or eight thirty , theatres open at a quarter to nine and really begin at nine o'clock . special features and acts , -- famous singers and vaudeville artists . are brought on at eleven o'clock so that dinner party people may arrive in time to see them . the theatres come out at midnight , after that there are the night suppers which flourish till two or half past .
so you look up the number in the book again . and at last she tells you that you are in connection . and then , ramming the trumpet tight against your ear . you stand waiting , and if there is one thing more than another likely to make a man feel ridiculous it is standing on tip toe in a corner . holding a machine to his head , and listening intently to nothing .
yes , that 's the way to get what you want , did you have any nobility on board ? they tell me over here that the best eating is on the french lines . yes , so i hear , but some say , too , that the scandinavian lines are best . and then again i have heard people boosting the italian lines . i guess each one has its points , they say that you get wine free with meals on the french boats .
i was in adelaide again , some months later . and saw the multitudes gather in the neighboring city of glenelg to commemorate the reading of the proclamation . in 1836 -- which founded the province , if i have at any time called it a colony . i withdraw the discourtesy , it is not a colony . it is a province ; and officially so , moreover , it is the only one so named in australasia .
[female] was saved this salutary treatment to a large extent . at first by virtue of the greatness of his family . and , later , by his own performances on the cricket field . his three elder brothers were objects of veneration to most wrykynians . and [male] got a certain amount of reflected glory from them .
the very ink with which all history is written is merely fluid prejudice . pudd'nhead wilsons 's new calendar , there is not a parallel of latitude but thinks it would have been the equator if it had had its rights . pudd'nhead [male] 's new calendar , next to mr. [male] . to me the most interesting convulsion of nature in [location] was the diamond crater . the [organization] gold fields are a stupendous marvel .
`` they still open ? '' they are , and pop goes right down to see the guy . he knows him fairly well anyway -- there 's mother 's day . and easter , and also the shop is the polling place for our district . so pop 's in there every election day . he always buys some little bunch of flowers election day because he figures the guy ought to get some business having his shop all messed up for the day .
now this is what is wrong , this is the huge modern heresy of altering the human soul to fit its conditions . instead of altering human conditions to fit the human soul , if soap boiling is really inconsistent with brotherhood . so much the worst for soap boiling , not for brotherhood , if civilization really can not get on with democracy . so much the worse for civilization , not for democracy , certainly , it would be far better to go back to village communes . if they really are communes , certainly , it would be better to do without soap rather than to do without society .
people were asking themselves by what right these aliens had overrun british soil . an ever growing feeling of annoyance had begun to lay hold of the nation . it is probable that the departure of sir [male] brought home to england what this invasion might mean . the great comedian , in his manifesto in the times , had not minced his words . plainly and crisply he had stated that he was leaving the country because the music hall stage was given over to alien gowks .
[female] then begged [female] to withdraw to a little distance . since , if the duke should chance to be of the company approaching . it would be desirable that he should speak to him before he could enter ferrara . which was but a short distance from them , [male] complied . and as soon as he had withdrawn , [male] removed the covering by which he had concealed the rich ornament of his hat .
who thinks that it is scarcely fair to have to pay for road repair while sudden death lies lurking there , the ratepayer . who as the car goes whizzing past at such law breaking stands aghast . ( for forty miles an hour is fast ) , , the policeman . who hears the case with bland surprise . and over human frailty sighs , the while he reads between the lies , the magistrate .
as it was not possible to do anything more i took my passage in a homeward bound indiaman . to return to [location] , and lay the matter before [organization] . we had not proceeded thus many weeks , advancing with incredible fatigue by continual towing . when we fell in with a fleet of negro men . as they call them , these wretches .
it is so pleasant to find real merit appreciated , whatever its particular walk in life may be . that the general harmony of the company was doubtless much promoted by their knowing that the two men of the world were held in great esteem by the upper classes of society . and by the gallant defenders of their country in the army and navy . but particularly the former , the least of their stories had a colonel in it . lords were as plentiful as oaths ; and even the blood royal ran in the muddy channel of their personal recollections .
reginald puckered his brow into a tortured frown . and i knew that my point was gained , he was debating what tie would go with which waistcoat . during the drive to the mckillops [male] was possessed with a great peace . which was not wholly to be accounted for by the fact that he had inveigled his feet into shoes a size too small for them . i misgave more than ever , and having once launched [male] on to the mckillops
interesting , and easy to understand -- except in one detail , which i will mention presently . it is easy to understand why the [location] sugar planter should want the [male] recruit . he is cheap , very cheap , in fact , these are the figures paid by the planter . l20 to the recruiter for getting the [male] or `` catching '' him . as the missionary phrase goes ; l3 to the [location] government for `` superintending '' the importation .
a young french gentleman of my acquaintance , who visited england to study the language . told me that the impression made upon him by his first social evening in [location] was that of a parrot house . later on , when he came to comprehend , he , of course . recognized the brilliancy and depth of the average [location] drawing room talk . but that is how , not comprehending , it impressed him at first , listening to the riot of a rookery is much the same experience .
there is , too , another feature in the case , it seems that a new family by the name of gaylord have come to town and opened up the old gaylord mansion . gaylord is a son of old [male] gaylord . and is a millionaire , they are making quite a splurge in the way of balls and liveried servants . and motor cars , and the town is agog with it all . there are young people in the family , and especially there is a girl .
these things , he felt , had won him his place in the greatest splendor of the moonlight quill . it was due to them that he was not still making `` chests useful for keeping things , '' as he was taught with breathless practicality in high school . and selling them to whoever had use of such chests , possibly undertakers . nevertheless when the progressive moonlight quill became the retrogressive moonlight quill he preferred to sink with it .
great political excitement , there is no doubt , turns men 's heads . once i recollect finding a most dignified provincial politician in this state , and necessity compelled me to turn him into a sketching stool . mr. [male] was speaking at bingley [male] . [location] , and although close to him on the platform . i could not , being only five feet two , see over the heads of others when all stood to cheer .
as lady marchpane had said , it was bound to be a close thing . the liberatives and the unialists , of course . were solid against the bill , but there was also something of a cave in the tariffadical party . it was bound to be a close thing , and rupert 's speech just made the difference . when he sat down the waverers and doubters had made up their minds .
within the house boat were gathered a merry party . some of whom were on mere pleasure bent , others of whom had come to listen to a debate . for which the entertainment committee had provided , between the venerable patriarch [male] and the late eminent showman p. t. [male] . the question to be debated was upon the resolution passed by the committee . that `` the animals of the antediluvian period were far more attractive for show purposes than those of modern make , ''
tramp , tramp , tramping along the road . in singles , couples , groups , and gangs . you have the working man and the working woman -- but not clothed like ours , usually the man is a nobly built great athlete . with not a rag on but his loin handkerchief ; his color a deep dark brown . his skin satin , his rounded muscles knobbing it as if it had eggs under it .
mr. [male] also plays [male] so that old settlers here say it seems almost like having [male] here among [location] again . in act four [male] sits up late reading a story by e. p. roe . and just as he is in the most exciting part of it the ghost of the assassinated casar appears and states that it will meet him with hard gloves at philippi . [male] looks bored and says that he is not in condition . but the ghost leaves it that way and [male] looks still more bored till the ghost goes out through a white oak door without opening it .
he liked to be master ; but even to be master he would not encounter the abominable nuisance of a quarrel . when first coming to the diocese he had had some little difficulty with our doctor . but the bishop had abstained from violent assertion , and they had . on the whole , been friends , there was , however , on the bishop 's part . something of a feeling that the doctor was the bigger man .
[female] , meanwhile , had been doing quite an unprecedented amount of thinking . quite an intellectual pallor had begun to appear on his normally pink cheeks , he had discovered the profound truth that it is one thing to talk about paying one 's debts . another actually to do it , and that this is more particularly the case when we owe twenty pounds and possess but six pounds seven shillings and fourpence . [male] was acutely conscious of the fact that , if he could not follow up his words to wesson with actual coin . the result would be something of an anticlimax .
in spite of a certain reasonableness in the pessimist 's logic . in spite of circumstances he was incapable of explaining . in spite , even , of cynthia galbraith . a latent belief in [male] integrity crystallized into certainty . and he rose to his feet freed of the doubts that had previously assailed him .
louis was at this time endowed with all the natural gifts which make the perfect gentleman . his eye was brilliant , mild , and of a clear azure blue . but the most skillful physiognomists , those divers into the soul . on fixing their looks upon it , if it had been possible for a subject to sustain the glance of the king . the most skillful physiognomists , we say , would never have been able to fathom the depths of that abyss of mildness .
but after a few days we found that we could not abide that poor woman 's distress . so we begged [female] to examine her several possible careers . and see if he could not change her , to her profit . to a new one , he said the longest of her careers as they now stood gave her forty two years to live . and her shortest one twenty nine , and that both were charged with grief and hunger and cold and pain .
the next ball was of the same length , but this time off the off stump . [male] jumped out , and hit it before it had time to break . it flew along the ground through the gap between cover and extra cover . a comfortable three , off the second ball of the other man 's over [male] scored his first boundary . it was a long hop on the off .
betty devoted half an hour to the camel , she devoted at least half an hour to all visiting men . it was usually sufficient , when she approached a new man the current debutantes were accustomed to scatter right and left like a close column deploying before a machine gun . and so to perry parkhurst was awarded the unique privilege of seeing his love as others saw her . he was flirted with violently , this paradise of frail foundation was broken into by the sounds of a general ingress to the ballroom . the cotillion was beginning , [organization] and the camel joined the crowd .
each was a little more unlike him than the last , and this lent variety to the collection . her father marked her new born enthusiasm for the game with approval . it had been secretly a great grief to the old gentleman that his only child did not know the difference between a linesman and an inside right . and , more , did not seem to care to know , he felt himself drawn closer to her . an understanding , as pleasant as it was new and strange , began to spring up between parent and child .
when the weather was calm i used to notice my italian friend seated . surrounded by the ladies , with an air of triumph and a smile upon his intelligent visage . he was having his revenge , when he was not sketching . he was playing chess with the [male] . now this commander was a [male] from the top of his head to the soles of his feet .
as the two churches moved , their congregations , or at least all that was best of them . such members as were sharing in the rising fortunes of the city . moved also , and now for some six or seven years the two churches and the two congregations had confronted one another among the elm trees of the avenue opposite to the university . but at this point the fortunes of the churches had diverged .asaph 's was a brilliant success ;osoph 's was a failure . even its own trustees could not deny it , at a time whenasaph 's was not only paying its interest but showing a handsome surplus on everything it undertook .
do not be alarmed if you hear me groaning , i have to groan heartrendingly in one of them . and it 's really hard to get up a good artistic groan , marilla . [female] is sulky because she did not get the part she wanted in the dialogue . she wanted to be the fairy queen . that would have been ridiculous , for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as [female] ? fairy queens must be slender , [female] is to be the queen and i am to be one of her maids of honor .
down in the swamp , two miles away , could he have but seen it . there moved a sleigh , and in it a man dressed in a sealskin coat and silk hat . whose face beamed in the moonlight as he turned to and fro and stared at each object by the roadside as at an old familiar scene . round his waist was a belt containing a million dollar in gold coin . and as he halted his horse in an opening of the road he unstrapped the belt and counted the coins .
so you may in certain quarters of [location] . but in either place the man who can afford to pay more for his dinner will find it to his ultimate well being to do so . simply because a boarding house in [male] or [location] is known as a pension does not keep it from being a boarding house . and a pretty average bad one , as i have been informed by misguided americans who tried living at a pension . and afterwards put in a good deal of their spare time regretting it .
i went out without another word ; he was mad , of course . or he would not have devised so outrageous a revenge for a fancied injury . but he was cunning enough to be my match , i knew too well that if i took any legal measures . he would contrive to shift the whole burden of lunacy upon me . i dared not court an inquiry for many reasons .
at length , he knew not how , more dead than alive , he reached the gate of the city . a band of ill bred dogs , that were serenading at a corner of the street . seeing the notary dash by , joined in the hue and cry . and ran barking and yelping at his heels . it was now late at night , and only here and there a solitary lamp twinkled from an upper story .
among nations which had shaken off the authority of the church of rome . the priests still retained almost an exclusive power of joining men and women together in marriage . this appears rather , however , to have been by the tacit consent of the civil power . than from any defect in its right and authority . for in the time of oliver [female] .
let them but make the most inane of remarks . and at once the maiden by their side will be rocking with laughter . whereas , should a state councillor enter into conversation with a damsel . and remark that the russian empire is one of vast extent . or utter a compliment which he has elaborated not without a certain measure of intelligence ( however strongly the said compliment may smack of a book ) .
when he came down on this particular morning , the meal was nearly over . mr. [male] had disappeared , taking his correspondence with him . mrs. [female] had gone into the kitchen . and when [female] appeared the thing had resolved itself into a mere vulgar brawl between [female] and ella for the jam . while marjory , who had put her hair up a fortnight before .
for a few seconds mrs. [female] stood at the end of the road . staring at the door that had closed behind them , her face was white and set . and a grey line of grimness marked the spot where her lips had disappeared . she had noted that the girl was pretty , with fair hair that clung about her head in wanton little tendrils and . furthermore , that it was bound with a broad band of light green ribbon .
it was natural for him to reflect -- he had months to do it in . upon his own escape , and mark 's extremity . this led him to consider which of them could be the better spared , and why ? then the curtain slowly rose a very little way ; and self . self , self , was shown below , he asked himself .
[male] is to get what is called , in the new money , one seventy five a day . and to get it for four days , and [male] ferdinand says that comes to four dollar and a quarter . [male] ferdinand is very quick with figures . he says that he will have to take out a small commission for managing the money for [male] . and that later on he will tell [male] how much will be left after taking it out .
his expression was pathetically offensive , the result of his bland confidence in the audible opinions of a small town whereof his father was the richest inhabitant . and the one thing about him , even more obvious than his chin . his legs , and his spectacular taste in flannels . was his perfect trust that he was as welcome to every one as he was to his mother . this might some day lead him in the direction of great pain .
rob , this is a painful state of things , old person , rich . happily coupled are we , you see -- i am a jolly person tar . my star , and you are the fairest , the richest and rarest of innocent lasses you are . by far -- of innocent lasses you are , fanned by a favouring gale . you will sail over life 's treacherous sea with me .
he gazed searchingly at the three roads , but to single out one of them as straighter than the other two was a task that baffled him completely . a sign post informed him of three things , by following road one he might get to brindleham . and ultimately , if he persevered , to corden , road number two would lead him to old inns . whatever they might be , with the further inducement of little benbury . while if he cast in his lot with road three he might hope sooner or later to arrive at much middlefold on the hill .
mr. [male] gave his horse its head and he shot to the front . but grady was nearly a field in the lead . and it promised to be a long chase , as he was on the major 's black thoroughbred . the cowboy rode along with a loose rein and an easy balance seat . at his fences he swung his hat and cheered .
i do not imagine that it is necessary to demonstrate that this poetic allusiveness is the characteristic of true slang . such an expression as `` keep your hair on '' is positively meredithian in its perverse and mysterious manner of expressing an idea . the americans have a well-known expression about `` swelled head '' as a description of self approval . and the other day i heard a remarkable fantasia upon this air . an [location] said that after the chinese war the japanese wanted `` to put on their hats with a shoe horn . ''
she has spent three winters in [location] since then . now when she feels like passing through a door that is standing wide open just in front of her . and which leads to just the place she wants to get to , and an official shakes his head at her . and explains that she must not , but must go up two flights of stairs and along a corridor and down another flight of stairs . and so get to her place that way , she apologises for her error and trots off looking ashamed of herself .
womanly , that did it , i felt that she was womanly , and it came about that it was my [female] of the cobo shrimping journeys that i was prepared to welcome as i drove that morning to waterloo station . and so , when the train rolled in , and the goodwins alighted , and [female] kissed me . by an extraordinarily lucky chance i found that i loved her more dearly than ever . mrs. [female] , [female] , and myself occupied the stage box . and in various parts of the house i could see the familiar faces of those whom i had invited as my guests .
she appeared to plead with him , standing there in the flood of light which shone from the open door of her father 's house . my eyes were fixed upon the two faces , that of the beautiful girl and of the dark . fierce man , for my instinct told me that it was my own fate which was under debate . for a long time the soldier shook his head , and then , at last softening before her pleadings . he appeared to give way , he turned to where i stood with my guardian sergeant beside me .
`` i -- i -- '' [organization] began confusedly . she was utterly unable to account for skinner , and it made her task of explaining difficult . [male] came to the rescue , he did not like to think how [organization] would receive the news . but for her own sake he must speak now , it would have required a harder hearted man than himself to resist the mute pleading of his father 's grease painted face . mr. [male] was a game sport .
a neat-looking colored girl answered the bell , and , showing our reporter into the parlor . asked his business , and if he `` knew madame [male] 's terms ? '' fortunately the cash customer had erred not thus , but he made known to the colored lady his simple business . learning that he only wanted to have his fortune told by the madame . and had no occasion to test her skill in the more expensive departments of her profession .
from this time , and since my marriage , which had occurred at this period . i have belonged to the staff of mcgill university . first as lecturer in political science , and later as head of [organization] and political science . as this position is one of the prizes of my profession . i am able to regard myself as singularly fortunate .
the graveyard in [location] only about one eighth of an acre . the graves are sunk in the living rock . and are very permanent ; but occupation of them is only temporary ; the occupant can only stay till his grave is needed by a later subject . he is removed , then , for they do not bury one body on top of another . as i understand it , a family owns a grave .
mr. [male] moved through the dimly lighted chamber with all the cat-like stealthiness of an accomplished valet . arranging the various articles of his master 's wardrobe . and giving , so far as he was able , the semblance of an accustomed spot to this new and strange locality . already , indeed , it was very unlike what it had been during [location] 's occupation . guns , whips , fishing tackle , dog leashes , and landing nets had all disappeared .
from the window of the first floor front of number seven a girl was leaning . the spring sunshine played on her golden hair and lit up her bright blue eyes . fixed on his flanneled and sweatered person with a fascinated amusement , even as he turned . the laugh smote him afresh , for the space of perhaps two seconds they stared at each other . eye to eye , then she vanished into the room .
of course the question at issue is whether the potential immoral picture shall first be shown at the producer 's or the exhibitor 's risk . or whether censorship shall come first before there has been any public showing , the contention is made by some of the moving picture people that they should have the same freedom given to people who deal in print to publish first and take the consequences later if any statute has been violated . the right to free speech , in fact . has been invoked in favor of the motion picture as a medium of expression . this view had the support of the late mayor gaynor .
but that was all , he had the air all the time of a man who had been reared in luxury and fondled so much in the lap of wealth that he was weary of life . and yearned for a bright immortality , i have often wished that the pruning hook of time would use a little more discretion . the blase young man seemed to be tired all the time . he was weary of life because life was hollow . he seemed to hanker for the cool and quiet grave .
[female] felt he knew not how , the whole peace of the world was pent up painfully in his heart . the new and childlike world which he had seen so suddenly , men had not seen at all . here they were still at their old bewildering , pardonable , useless quarrels . with so much to be said on both sides , and so little that need be said at all . a fierce inspiration fell on him suddenly ; he would strike them where they stood with the love of god .
at night they are empty and dark , and a stillness broods on them . broken only by the cracked tingle of an occasional piano playing one of the easier hymns . a form of music to which the dwellers in the dingy houses are greatly addicted . by day they achieve a certain animation through the intermittent appearance of women in aprons . who shake rugs out of the front doors or , emerging from areas .
soyer is gone , then be it said , at last , indeed , great pan is dead . sergeant prime had a remarkably long nose , and being one day out riding , was flung from his horse . and fell upon his face in the middle of the road . a countryman , who saw the occurrence , ran hastily up , raised the sergeant from the mire . and asked him if he was much hurt .
that was the end of the tale , the passenger who told it said that when he read the story twenty five years ago in a train he was interrupted at that point . the train jumped off a bridge , of course none but a happy ending of the story would be accepted by the jury . the finish must find brown in high credit with the ladies . his behavior without blemish , his modesty unwounded . his character for self sacrifice maintained , the old people rescued through him .
that is what he had been saying to the summer sky . ten minutes before , unfortunately , he was unable to say it finally , definitively . and now that he was near her it seemed to matter wonderfully little , `` she is a woman who will lie , '' he had said to himself , now , as he went along . he reminded himself of this observation .
at last , when the string was all let out , there came a sudden gust of wind . and in an instant poor zingle was drawn into the air as easily as an ordinary kite draws its tail . up and up he soared , and the kite followed the wind and carried him over many countries until the strength died out of the air . when the kite slowly settled toward the earth and landed the prince in the top of a tall tree . he now untied the string from his waist and fastened it to a branch of the tree .
marjorie waited until the shower of broken words collapsed into little sniffles . [female] 's sobs rose to a flute note . and rising of a sudden she fled from the room , an hour later . while marjorie was in the library absorbed in composing one of those non committal marvelously elusive letters that only a young girl can write . [female] reappeared , very red eyed , and consciously calm , she cast no glance at marjorie but took a book at random from the shelf and sat down as if to read .
for the moment we are sitting listening . amid bursts of applause , to our treasurer 's statement . as we hear it we realise that this peace kermesse has proved the culmination and crown of four winters ', war work . our efforts began with the very opening of the war . we felt that a rich organisation like ours ought to do something for the relief of the belgians .
in her own town she had the name of being a cold proposition . but that was because the primitive yokels of a one night stand could not attune themselves to the views of one who was troubled with ideals . her soul panted for the higher life , alas , the rube town in which she hung forth was given over to croquet . mush and milk sociables . a lodge of elks and two married preachers who doctored for the tonsilitis .
that was despair , there was no plan for me . i saw that ; i must stay where i was ; stay , and wait . and take what might come -- it was not my affair ; that was what life is . my mother had said it , then -- well , then the calling began again ! all my sorrows came back , i said to myself .
[female] knew that this was quite true , but strove to allay their fears in the best way he could . but what availed with them more than all his arguments , was that the wind sprang up again . so that they crowded all sail , and in nine days reached [location] . from which they had been only a month absent on their cruise . [male] would not enter the port with only joyous demonstrations .
mamma looked disconcerted , the expression of her face implied the fear that the peddler would not even accept it as a gift . chloe and she held a whispering consultation . at this moment binah came in with little patsey . who , seeing the articles on the slab , pointed with her dimpled fingers . and said her only words , at the same moment , lafayette and [female] .
you see , [female] and [female] were so exactly equal in their skill on the links that life for them had for some time past resolved itself into a silent . bitter struggle in which first one , then the other , gained some slight advantage . if [female] won the may medal by a stroke , [female] would be one ahead in the june competition . only to be nosed out again in july , it was a state of affairs which . had they been men of a more generous stamp .
the letter being duly signed , sealed , and delivered , was handed to mark tapley . for immediate conveyance if possible , and he succeeded so well in his embassy as to be enabled to return that same night . just as the house was closing , with the welcome intelligence that he had sent it upstairs to the young lady . enclosed in a small manuscript of his own , purporting to contain his further petition to be engaged in mr chuzzlewit 's service . and that she had herself come down and told him .
to my horror the engraver returned the block to me a week afterwards with an apologetic note . the face had been destroyed in the engraver 's hands . and he had `` plugged the block '' -- that is , another piece of wood had been inserted where the hero 's head had been . and whitened over , for me to draw another , the rest of the design had been engraved . that face gone , how could i conjure it up again on that unsightly .
in the case of caps , boots , and trousers it is akin to mania . it sometimes applies to dress waistcoats and evening ties . but has one of its greatest exacerbations in the matter of dressing gowns . if by any chance a cigarette has burned a hole in the dressing gown . it takes on the additional interest of survival .
and i had the magnificent joy of telling her that she was referring to `` porcelain and pink , '' which had appeared there several months before , these next stories are written in what . were i of imposing stature , i should call my `` second manner . '' `` the diamond as big as the ritz , '' which appeared last summer in the `` smart set , '' was designed utterly for my own amusement , i was in that familiar mood characterized by a perfect craving for luxury .
there was great talking about the old vixen as they all trotted away to cross [female] holt . how it was the same old fox that they had not killed in a certain run last january . and how one old farmer was quite sure that this very fox was the one which had taken them that celebrated run to bamham moor three years ago . and how she had been the mother of quite a priam 's progeny of cubs . and now that she should have been killed in a stokehole , while this was going on a young lady rode up along side of mr. [male] .
unfortunately the substitute had missed all this part of the act . he started out of the cage and [male] jumped at him and the man was not prepared to dodge . the moral seems to be that nobody should covet another man 's job . not even that of lion taming , some readers we suppose will find mr. [male] 's lion stories unwelcome because they may tend to take away their illusions . it is not to be denied that he has to some extent rubbed the gilt off the gingerbread by writing that the record for all the lions he has known consists of one substitute trainer and a cow .
men were initiated into the sect with solemn ceremonies . then they were taught how to strangle a person with the sacred choke cloth . but were not allowed to perform officially with it until after long practice , no half educated strangler could choke a man to death quickly enough to keep him from uttering a sound . a muffled scream , gurgle , gasp , moan . or something of the sort ; but the expert 's work was instantaneous .
protestants have persecuted catholics , but they did not take their livelihoods away from them . the catholics have persecuted the protestants with bloody and awful bitterness . but they never closed agriculture and the handicrafts against them . why was that ? that has the candid look of genuine religious persecution , not a trade union boycott in a religious dispute . the jews are harried and obstructed in [location] and [location] .
personally , i did not feel i wanted them to come again , i was beginning to take a dislike to them before i had seen them . i regarded them as a greedy and guzzling crew . but mr. [male] was so cheerfully emphatic , and i was so inexperienced , that again i let him have his way . he also promised that even in this department he would see to it personally that nothing was wasted . i also left him to engage the crew .
for some time past i have been calling upon a young lady friend at her house evenings and going out with her to friends ', nights . i should like to know if it would be all right to ask to take her alone with me to the theatre ? answer : certainly not , this column is very strict about these things , not alone . not for a moment , it is better taste to bring your father with you . in playing bridge please tell me whether the third or the second player ought to discard from weakness on a long suit when trumps have been twice round and the lead is with dummy .
one entered the world , [female] pursued , having ready made ideas about everything . one had a philosophy and tried to make life fit into it . one should have lived first and then made one 's philosophy to fit life ... life , facts . things were horribly complicated ; ideas , even the most difficult of them , deceptively simple . in the world of ideas everything was clear .
[ takes a chair from the table . seats herself beside her , and strokes her hands . ] my dear [female] -- how did this -- this friendship -- between you and eilert lovborg come about ? oh it grew up gradually , i gained a sort of influence over him . he gave up his old habits , not because i asked him to .
of course such a marriage would suit my child . and would suit me , he wished to say ; -- not only . or not chiefly , because your son is a nobleman , and will be an earl and a man of great property . that goes a long way with us , we are too true to deny it . we hate humbug , and want you to know simply the truth about us .
the derek she loved was a strong man . with a strong man 's contempt for other people 's criticism . and there had been something ignoble and fussy in his attitude regarding lady underhill . she had tried to feel that the flaw in her idol did not exist . and here was [organization] rooke , a man who admired derek with all his hero worshipping nature .
for some days burns appeared to be uneasy , and i observed him continually shading his eyes with his hand and staring at the horizon as if he were looking for land . twice i caught him with his red head against the chart in the cabin . gazing at that pin , which was always approaching and yet never reaching the african coast . at last one evening , as [male] and i were playing ecarte in the cabin . the mate entered with an angry look upon his sunburned face .
the druids ended their song abruptly , and made a dash at the occupant of the chair . the audience stood up , `` a victim for our ancient rites ! '' screamed the druids , falling upon the man and dragging him towards the property altar . the victim showed every sign of objection to early english rites . but he was dislodged , and after being dragged , struggling , across the table .
nothing can be more provoking to the human temper , nor more dangerous to that cardinal virtue . patience , than solicitations of extraordinary offices of kindness on behalf of those very persons with whom we are highly incensed . for this reason shakespear hath artfully introduced his desdemona soliciting favours for cassio of her husband . as the means of inflaming , not only his jealousy , but his rage . to the highest pitch of madness ; and we find the unfortunate moor less able to command his passion on this occasion .
at such times the theatres and churches were closed . and those who could get out of [location] , by land or water . fled to the inland shires of england . the mountains of [location] or to the heather hills of [location] . one bright morning in may , we boarded the good ship person .
she jumped down and snatched the thingummy from his hand . with bent brows and set teeth she wrenched it round . the engine gave a faint protesting mutter . like a dog that has been disturbed in its sleep , and was still once more . it was not bream who spoke but a strange voice -- a sepulchral voice .
a paper book is sent by boyle . too neatly gilt for me to soil : delany sends a silver standish . when i no more a pen can brandish , let both around my tomb be placed . as trophies of a muse deceas would . and let the friendly lines they writ , in praise of long departed wit .
you prosecute the man or woman who steals the goose from off the common . but leave the larger felon loose who steals the common from the goose . but here , as in the case of the monasteries , we confront the strange problem of submission . if they stole the common from the goose , one can only say that he was a great goose to stand it . the truth is that they reasoned with the goose .
we met now simply on business , and there was no expression of sentiment or feeling on either side . we cared nothing for each other , i commended her for her devotion to [female] . and then told her i believed , if the proper efforts were made . he could be pardoned out of prison , i told her what lawyer and other persons to see . and how to proceed in the matter , i gave her the most minute instructions .
breakfast was on the table in the sitting room . a modest meal of rolls , cereal , and imitation coffee . beside the pot containing this hell brew was a little pile of letters . mrs. [female] opened them as she ate . the majority were from disciples and dealt with matters of purely theosophical interest .
he says he is , she runs her fingers through his hair . he kisses her on the bare shoulder . this is also symbolic , lady cicely rattles on about amalfi and fiesole . she asks mr. [male] if he remembers that night in the olive trees at [male] . with just one thrush singing in the night sky .
we hail true merit just as heartily and uproariously on a throne as we would anywhere else . in fact , it is more deserving , if possible , for one who has never tried it little knows how difficult it is to sit on a hard throne all day and write well . we are to recognize struggling genius wherever it may crop out . it is no small matter for an almost unknown monarch to reign all day and then write an article for the press or a chapter for a serial story . only , perhaps , to have it returned by the publishers , all these things are drawbacks to a literary life .
[female] 's landing was a slaveholding town . with a rich , slave worked grain and pork country back of it . the town was sleepy and comfortable and contented , it was fifty years old . and was growing slowly -- very slowly , in fact , but still it was growing . the chief citizen was york leicester driscoll , about forty years old .
his words were music to mr goble 's ears . he felt that his napoleonic action had justified itself by success . his fury left him , if he had been capable of beaming . one would have said that he beamed at freddie , five minutes later . in the wings , freddie , receiving congratulations from nelly bryant , asserted himself .
we made good time ; and a couple of hours before sunset we stood upon the high confines of the valley of holiness . and our eyes swept it from end to end and noted its features . that is , its large features , these were the three masses of buildings . they were distant and isolated temporalities shrunken to toy constructions in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert , and was . such a scene is always mournful , it is so impressively still , and looks so steeped in death .
he felt devilish fit , he would have liked to run a mile or two and jump a few gates . he wished five or six starving beggars would come along ; it would be pleasant to give the poor blighters money . it was too much to expect at that time of night . of course , but it would be rather jolly if jess willard would roll up and try to pick a quarrel . he would show him something .
if one did not like the verdict of this court , he could appeal to the king on a certiorari or some such thing as that . the accused could clear himself by his own oath and that of others . but without these he had to stand what was called the `` ordeal , '' which consisted in walking on hot ploughshares without expressing a derogatory opinion regarding the ploughshares or showing contempt of court . sometimes the accused had to run his arm into boiling water , if after three days the injury had disappeared . the defendant was discharged and costs taxed against the king .
while engaged in packing our portmanteaux there came a sharp knock at the door . and upon opening it i found upon the person floor an envelope addressed to myself . there was no one anywhere in the person , and , so quickly had i opened the door after the knock . that fact mystified me , it would hardly have been possible for any person . however nimble of foot , to have passed out of sight in the period which had elapsed between the summons and my response .
mrs. [female] almost smiled , her party was proving a success . mrs. [female] , still holding the top of her stay busk in her left hand . nodded approval , her beady little eyes fixed upon the singers . she was awaiting an opportunity to bring from her pocket a half quartern bottle containing what . if she had been caught drinking it , she would have described as clove water , taken medicinally .
i dashed to the rescue , stood astride the brook , and offered a hand to each boy . when a treacherous tuft of grass gave way . and , with a glorious splash , i went in myself , this accident turned toddie 's sorrow to laughter . but i can not say i made light of my misfortune on that account . to fall into clean water is not pleasant , even when one is trout fishing ; but to be clad in white pants .
[female] to get tea ; while [female] . foraging about the house , was presently delighted by discovering the lid of the water butt upon the kitchen shelf . here , then , was the packing case complete ; in the absence of straw , the blankets ( which he himself . at least , had not the smallest intention of using for their present purpose ) would exactly take the place of packing . and [male] , as the difficulties began to vanish from his path .
she always brings her child out with her on these occasions . she seems to think that it will freshen it up . the child does not appreciate the snow as much as she does . he says it 's cold , one thing that must irritate the stage heroine very much on these occasions is the way in which the snow seems to lie in wait for her and follow her about . it is quite a fine night before she comes on the scene .
not always was the kangaroo as now we do behold him . but a different animal with four short legs , he was grey and he was woolly . and his pride was inordinate : he danced on an outcrop in the middle of australia . and he went to the little god nqa , he went to nqa at six before breakfast . saying , `` make me different from all other animals by five this afternoon . ''
galileo was the author of a little work called `` i discarsi e dimas trazioni matematiche intorus a due muove scienze . '' it was a neat little book , of about the medium height . and sold well on the trains , for the pisan newsboys on the cars were very affable . as they are now , and when they came and leaned an armful of these books on a passenger 's leg and poured into his ear a long tale about the wonderful beauty of the work . and then pulled in the name of the book from the rear of the last car .
this latter personage was a man of rather less than the usual stature and the usual weight . with a quick , observant , agreeable dark eye . a small quantity of thin dark hair , and a small mustache . he had been standing with his hands in his pockets . and when [male] looked at him he took them out .
but they say she kept on a smilin for some time -- could not seem to stop , she had got so hardened into that way . and once , when her face wuz all swelled up with the toothache , she smiled at him accordin to rule when he got home , and they say the effect wuz fearful . both on her looks and the deacon 's acts .
they combated the point some time longer in the same way . emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend . for mrs. [female] was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over . and the instrument in preparation ; -- and at the same moment mr. [male] approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it . [female] , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs. [female] .
why then , said he , we will go and sell this old fellow 's ass at abingdon . for you know the fair is tomorrow . and we shall meet with chapmen enough ; therefore do you take the panniers off . and put them upon my back , and the bridle over my head . and then lead you the ass to market .
oh no , i think not , she said something about changing the dress she wore at dinner . she will come , and the warden thanked his young friend for the great kindness he had shown to zuleika . he hoped the duke had not let her worry him with her artless prattle . `` she seems to be a good , amiable girl , '' he added . in his detached way , sitting beside him , the duke looked curiously at the venerable profile .
one of these stick rattlers passed as bill stood there looking down , the noise startled him for a moment . then he seemed to come to the conclusion that this sort of thing was to be expected if you went out into the great world and that a parrot who intended to see life must not allow himself to be deterred by trifles . he crooned a little , and finally , stepping in a stately way over the window sill . with his toes turned in at right angles , caught at the top of the railing with his beak . and proceeded to lower himself , arrived at the level of the street .
to ruth , as to most women , his gifts were his attraction . he danced well ; he talked well ; he did everything well . he appealed to a side of ruth 's nature which [male] scarcely touched . a side which had only come into prominence in the last year . [female] 's inability to accompany ruth into her present life had given [male] his chance .
at length the noise of some heavy carts descending towards the loire awakened [male] . he arose , looked around him like a man who has forgotten everything . perceived parry , shook him by the hand . and commanded him to settle the reckoning with master cropole . master cropole , being called upon to settle his account with parry .
it was then that [location] took command . as was his custom , and began to fight the indians and french as one would hunt varmints in [location] . braddock 's men fired by platoons into the trees and tore a few holes in the state line . but when most of the colonial troops were dead the regulars presented their tournures to the foe and fled as far as [location] . where they each took a bath and had some laundry work done , general [male] took command of the second expedition .
{ illustration caption equal in this work a day world . one is likely to forget that there is an etiquette of pleasure , just as there is an etiquette of dancing or the opera . one often hears a charming hostess refuse to invite this or that person to her home for a game of billiards on the ground that he or she is a `` bum sport '' or a `` rotten loser , '' the above scene illustrates one of the little . but conspicuous , blunders that people make , the gentleman .
in the days that followed their interrupted love scene at reigelheimer 's restaurant that night of lord [female] 's unfortunate encounter with the tray bearing waiter . [female] pickering 's behaviour had perplexed claire fenwick . she had taken it for granted that next day at the latest he would resume the offer of his hand . heart , and automobiles , but time passed and he made no move in that direction . of limousine bodies , carburettors , spark plugs , and inner tubes he spoke with freedom and eloquence .
but in this moment of despondency , and often afterwards . the recollection of mr pecksniff operated as a cordial to him . awakening in his breast an indignation that was very wholesome in nerving him to obstinate endurance . under the influence of this fiery dram he started off for [location] without more ado . arriving there in the middle of the night , and not knowing where to find a tavern open .
though i have been a close student of mr. [male] for years . i am free to say , and i do not wish to do an injustice to a great man in doing so . that his ideas of literature and my own are entirely dissimilar , possibly his book has had a little larger sale than mine . but that makes no difference , when i write a book it must engage the interest of the reader . and show some plot to it , it must not be jerky in its style and scattering in its statements .
april 12.—mustard and cress and radishes not come up yet , left farmerson repairing the scraper , but when i came home found three men working . i asked the meaning of it . and farmerson said that in making a fresh hole he had penetrated the gas pipe . he said it was a most ridiculous place to put the gas pipe . and the man who did it evidently knew nothing about his business .
i was living at the same boarding house in bloomsbury what i would lived at for the past ten years . and when i got there i find her letter shoved half under my door . that was it , mister , and i tell you it floored me . and then it come to me , kind of as a new idea . that i would best do something pretty soon , and up the stairs i went quick .
he stopped several weeks at the canary islands . where he and his one hundred and twenty men rested and got fresh water . he then set out sailing due west over an unknown sea to blaze the way for liberty . soon , however , his men began to murmur , they began also to pick on [location] and occupy his steamer chair when he wanted to use it himself . they got to making chalk marks on the deck and compelling him to pay a shilling before he could cross them .
as a matter of course , there were various explanations of the story propounded by various people . all wondrously wise in their own conceit , some would have it that `` the ghost '' was got up by some of the neighbors , who wished , in this manner . to drive away disreputable occupants ; others insisted that it was the revenge of an ousted tenant . etc. , etc , everybody offered his own theory , and , as is usual .
their rivalry brought out all that was worst in both of them , it is a mistake to suppose love only elevates . it can debase , it was a mean struggle for what to an onlooker must have appeared a remarkably unsatisfying prize . the loser might well have left the conqueror to her poor triumph . even granting it had been gained unfairly , but the old , ugly , primeval passions had been stirred in these women . and the wedding bells closed only the first act , the second is not difficult to guess .
he was inside the tea case when i saw him . so at least i was informed by the coolies who carried it . yet i recognized him instantly , neither he nor i , however , gave any sign of recognition other than an imperceptible movement of the outer eyelid . ( we spies learn to move the outer lid of the eye so imperceptibly that it can not be seen . ) yet after meeting poulispantzoff in this way i was not surprised to read in the evening papers a few hours afterward that the uncle of the young king of siam had been assassinated .
i was very cold when i got back into the boat . and , in my hurry to get my shirt on , i accidentally jerked it into the water . it made me awfully wild , especially as [male] burst out laughing . i could not see anything to laugh at . and i told [male] so , and he only laughed the more .
nevertheless , they got safely to the boat , although considerably vexed and hurt . and the quangle wangle 's right foot was so knocked about , that he had to sit with his head in his slipper for at least a week . after sailing on calmly for several more days , they came to another country . where they were much pleased and surprised to see a countless multitude of white mice with red eyes . all sitting in a great circle , slowly eating custard pudding with the most satisfactory and polite demeanor .
he replied that it was true , every christmas eve . for twenty five years , had he and they fought in that room . but they would never trouble him nor anybody else again . one by one , had he laid them out , spoilt , and utterly useless for all haunting purposes . he had finished off the last german band ghost that very evening .
yet , with all this , i believe i am better ; the doctor , a strange . unsophisticated creature , a cross between galen and caliban . seems to have hit off what the great dons of science never could detect , -- the true seat of my malady . he says -- and he really reasons out his case ingeniously . that the brain has been working for the inferior nerves , not limiting itself to cerebral functions .
he picked up his hat , smoothed it carefully and with a courtly inclination of his head . left the room , interesting and exciting things , [location] things . began to happen at once , to her , meditating , there entered pugsy maloney . the guardian of the gate of this shrine of peace . a nonchalant youth of about fifteen , with a freckled , mask like face .
not being contented with what he wuz doing he spent half his time with the factory hands . who wuz driven to work by want , and harried by the mighty foe , intemperance . a saloon on every corner and block . our twin [location] idols , intemperance and greed . taking every cent of money from the poor worshippers .
he was most fifty , and he looked it . his hair was long and tangled and greasy , and hung down , and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines . it was all black , no gray ; so was his long , mixed up whiskers . there war not no color in his face . where his face showed ; it was white ; not like another man 's white .
he complained of the draft , and miss [female] shut the window . he said then that he did not mean he wanted to suffocate . and she opened the one on the other side . the clock had hardly struck three when he accused her of having forgotten his medicine . yet when she brought it he refused to take it .
nature , fashioning him , had fashioned also a pedestal for him to stand and brood on . to pose and sing on , off that pedestal he was lost ... `` the idol has come sliding down from its pedestal '' the duke remembered these words spoken yesterday by zuleika . yes , at the moment when he slid down , he , too , was lost . for him , master dandy , the common arena was no place .
if i had a little more confidence in my longevity than i now have . i would go down there to the valley of the [male] . and i would gird up my loins , and i would write with that lonely warrior at salt lake . and with the aid and encouragement of our brethren of the press who do not favor the right of one man to marry an old woman 's home . we would rotten egg the bogus temple of zion till the civilized world .
daily muff potter 's gratitude made [male] he had spoken . but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue . half the time [male] was afraid [male] would never be captured . the other half he was afraid he would be . he felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse .
`` he will remain here , '' [male] whispered , `` come with me ! '' softly turning the key upon him as they went out . he conducted [male] into the adjoining room . in which they had been before , [male] was so amazed , so shocked , and confounded by what he had heard that it was some time before he could reduce it to any order in his mind . or could sufficiently comprehend the bearing of one part upon another , to take in all the details at one view .
they rose from the breakfast table and went . arm in arm , to the sitting room . they divided the morning paper and sat in silence for a while . [female] went over the first page , read the prospects for war between [location] and [location] . then the european despatches , and then came to the page with the city news .
my military friend , with a pleasant laugh , confessed he did not see what was to be done . the policeman , more imaginative , saw a way out , it was that my military friend should set to work and pick up those fifty scraps of paper . he is an english general on the retired list . and of imposing appearance : his manner on occasion is haughty . he did not see himself on his hands and knees in the chief street of dresden .
we discussed it hotly all the way back to camp . we discussed it with care and privacy on the voyage home . we discussed it after that , still only among ourselves . while terry was making his arrangements , he was hot about it . lucky he had so much money -- we might have had to beg and advertise for years to start the thing .
and , miss [female] not favouring the scheme , they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern . on the summit they paused , the sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour . giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in surrey . grey clouds were charging across tissues of white . which stretched and shredded and tore slowly , until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue .
the -- but there 's no end to the list ; there are millions of them ! and all insane ; each in his own way ; insane as to his pet fad or opinion . but otherwise sane and rational , it is a mere plain simple fact . as clear and as certain as that eight and seven make fifteen , and by it we recognise that we are all insane . as concerns those matters , if we were sane we should all see a political or religious doctrine alike .
the inanity of the question enraged even the pleasure seekers at the back . `` sit down , fice , '' roared the pleasure seekers , mr bickersdyke resumed his speech . but the fire had gone out of it , he had lost his audience . a moment before , he had grasped them and played on their minds ( or what passed for minds down kenningford way ) . as on a stringed instrument , now he had lost his hold .
there were other cases i could have recited showing the ill recompense that so often overtakes the virtuous action . but , as i explained to bute , it would have saddened me to dwell upon the theme . it was quite a large party assembled at theleonards ' . including one or two county people , and i should have liked . myself , to have made a better entrance , a large lady with a very small voice seemed to be under the impression that i had arranged the whole business on purpose .
my scheme was to treat her as she treated me , and tho she might even draw my own picture or play malbrook ( which is the only tune i ever really liked ) . not to say so much as thank you eloisa ; tho i had for many years constantly hollowed whenever she played . bravo , bravissimo , encore , [male] , allegretto . con expressione , and poco presto with many other such outlandish words .
it was not the idea with which you went to bed . but now , as things have turned out , it seems as good a plan as lying there hopelessly awake . and you agree , on this wednesday morning , [male] , it seems . clamoured to get up at a quarter past five , and persuaded them to let him teach them cycling tricks round the cucumber frames on [female] 's new wheel . even mrs. [female] , however , did not blame [female] on this occasion .
blushing to the roots of his hair , and with crablike gait . mr. [male] , the junior fellow . went and unhooked from the wall that little shield of wood on which the words of the grace are carven . mr. [male] was -- mr. [male] is , a mathematician . his treatise on the higher theory of short division by decimals had already won for him an european reputation .
my house is not the kind that seems to crave an elevator . an elevator in my house would lose money . there is no popular clamor for one , and if i were to put one in i would have to abolish the dining room . it would also interfere with the parlor , i have learned recently that the correspondent who came here to write up this matter visited the town while i was in the south . and as he could not find me he was at the mercy of strangers .
they send a bucket of water slashing along the side of the ship and into the ports . drenching the passenger 's clothes , and often the passenger himself . this good old custom prevailed in this ship , and under unusually favorable circumstances . for in the blazing tropical regions a removable zinc thing like a sugarshovel projects from the port to catch the wind and bring it in . this thing catches the wash water and brings it in .
said he , i can fasten the rivet . i like a job of that sort excessively . i never shall forget his manner , and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet . and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , `` oh ! '' said he directly , there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good .
[male] 's doing everything he could to recover it . he wondered a little what [male] could have been doing to run up a bill as big as that . but it did not occur to him to ask , which was unfortunate , as it might have saved him a good deal of inconvenience . it seemed to him that it was none of his business to inquire into [male] 's private affairs . he took the envelope containing the money without question .
[male] handkerchiefs upon the two over bulging cargoes . that their nature might not be disclosed to the curious , and , after listening a moment at his door . took the baskets , one upon each arm , then went quickly down the stairs and out of the house . out of the yard , and into the alley -- by which route he had modestly chosen to travel . ... after an absence of about two hours he returned empty-handed and anxious .
the entire orthodox world owes a debt to [female] . in all the other arts , philosophies , religions and what nots conservatism seems to be crumbling before the attacks of the radicals . a stylist may generally be identified today by his bloody nose . even in [male] 's profession of pugilism the correct method has often been discredited of late . it may be remembered that [male] announced before `` the battle of the century ''
london by night had always had an immense fascination for me . coming out of the restaurant after supper , i felt no inclination to return to my lodgings . and end the greatest night of my life tamely with a book and a pipe . here was i , a young man , fortified by an excellent supper , in the heart of [male] 's [location] . why should i have no new arabian night adventure ? i would stroll about for half an hour .
but , still , it is not everybody who can make them . and the occasion was one to be marked , [male] had read the news in the evening paper in the train . and had sent his brother a wire from the station , congratulating him . he had wondered whether he himself would ever achieve the feat in first class cricket . he did not see why he should not , he looked forward through a long vista of years of county cricket .
she was greeted on her arrival by an entirely new and original stripling in the place of the one with whom at her last visit she had established such cordial relations . like his predecessor he was generously pimpled , but there the resemblance stopped . he was a grim boy , and his manner was stern and suspicious . he peered narrowly at sally for a moment as if he had caught her in the act of purloining the office blotting paper . then , with no little acerbity , desired her to state her business .
the sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day 's sketch to wish to go on . there was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude . and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure . to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last . and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both .
ashe 's presence was the direct outcome of her lecture on enterprise . and it added a complication to an already complicated venture . she glanced furtively at him over the magazine . choosing by ill chance a moment when he had just directed his gaze at her . their eyes met and there was nothing for it but to talk .
in the circumstances , two hours was a good while for [location] to have to wait . but when the illumination did at last come , we felt repaid , it came unexpectedly . of course -- things always do , that have been long looked and longed for . with a perfectly breath-taking suddenness several mast sheaves of varicolored rockets were vomited skyward out of the black throats of the castle towers . accompanied by a thundering crash of sound , and instantly every detail of the prodigious ruin stood revealed against the mountainside and glowing with an almost intolerable splendor of fire and color .
he had vanished as if off the face of the earth . by what awful error in our preparations , by what neglect of some necessary psychic precautions . he had met his fate , i can not tell . but the evidence was only too clear , that [male] had been engulfed into the astral world . carrying with him the money for the transfer of which he had risked his mundane existence .
how many men he knew were now paymasters . and secretaries of legation , solely because those high in the government met them daily at the metropolitan club . and preferred them in almost any other place , and if , after three weeks as his guest on board what the newspapers called his floating palace . the senator could refuse him even the prize . legation of [location] , there was no value in modest merit .
i will not deny that for just about four minutes after the train has left . bearing mother , sister , junior , ingabog and the mechanical walrus on their way to anybunkport . daddy is suffused with a certain queer feeling of being eleven years old and down town alone for the first time with fifteen cents to spend on anything he wants . the city seems to spread itself out before him just ablaze with lights and his feet rise lightly from the ground as if attached to toy balloons . i do not deny that his first move is to straighten his tie .
now , all through the day [female] had been assailed by a steady stream of determined ear biters . again and again he had been staked out as an ore producing claim by men whom it would have been impolitic to rebuff . he was tired of lending , and in a mood to resent unauthorized demands . [male] struck him as particularly unauthorized , he said so . it took some little time to convince mr flower that he really meant it .
such were the ideas of the unfortunate prince while sitting listlessly upon his horse . to which he abandoned the reins : he rode slowly along beneath the warm may sun . in which the somber misanthropy of the exile perceived a last insult to his grief . this man , old , tall , and thin , with white hair , -- we speak of the one standing by the gate . this man replied to the farewell signals of the young one by signs of parting as tender as could have been made by a father .
it 's been my experience that pride is usually a spur to the strong and a drag on the weak . it drives the strong man along and holds the weak one back , it makes the fellow with the stiff upper lip and the square jaw smile at a laugh and laugh at a sneer . it keeps his conscience straight and his back humped over his work . it makes him appreciate the little things and fight for the big ones . but it makes the fellow with the retreating forehead do the thing that looks right .
for their after luncheon coffee the party generally adjourned to the library . its windows looked east , and at this hour of the day it was the coolest place in the whole house . it was a large room , fitted , during the eighteenth century . with white painted shelves of an elegant design , in the middle of one wall a door . ingeniously upholstered with rows of dummy books .
the law could not touch you for being influenced by sovietski . but there is an ethical as well as a legal code , and this it was obvious that [male] had transgressed . women drew away from him slightly , holding their skirts . men looked at him censoriously , [male] started violently . and dropped a tea cup , and cuthbert banks , doing his popular imitation of a sardine in his corner .
q was a quince that hung upon a garden tree . papa he brought it with him home . and ate it with his tea , r was a railway rug extremely large and warm . papa he wrapped it round his head . in a most dreadful storm , s was papa 's new stick .
that it was not the nearest and most direct route which they took to the trysting place [male] became aware after he had followed his young guide through doors and up stairs and down stairs and had at last come to a halt in a room to which the sound of the music penetrated but faintly . he recognized the room , he had been in it before . it was the same room where he and billie dore had listened to keggs telling the story of lord [male] and his leap . that window there , he remembered now , opened on to the very balcony from which the historic [male] had done his spectacular dive . that it should be the scene of this other secret meeting struck [male] as appropriate .
how he had fired my country girl imagination , he had been the most brilliant writer on the big . brilliant sheet -- and the most dissolute , how my heart had pounded on that first lonely day when this wonder being looked up from his desk . saw me , and strolled over to where i sat before my typewriter , he smiled down at me , companionably . i am quite sure that my mouth must have been wide open with surprise , he had been smoking a cigarette an expensive-looking , gold tipped one . now he removed it from between his lips with that hand that always shook a little .
nothing escapes him ; he notices everything that happens . and brings out his opinion about it , particularly if it is a matter that is none of his business . and it is never a mild opinion , but always violent . violent and profane -- the presence of ladies does not affect him . his opinions are not the outcome of reflection .
so he presented himself , his heart . his license , and his ultimatum , and within five minutes they were in the midst of a violent quarrel . a burst of sporadic open fighting such as occurs near the end of all long wars and engagements . it brought about one of those ghastly lapses in which two people who are in love pull up sharp . look at each other coolly and think it 's all been a mistake , afterward they usually kiss wholesomely and assure the other person it was all their fault .
[female] gave her a virulent glance as he received the message and . turning his back on her , continued the dancing lesson . the litany passed more quickly than he ever remembered its doing before , he replaced the rat in his pocket as they rose for the hymn . it was during the hymn that the catastrophe occurred . the browns occupied the front seat of the church .
it was half-way up the haymarket that he first became conscious of the girl with the red hair . having become conscious of this girl , [female] , ever a warm admirer of the sex . began to feel a certain interest stealing over him . with interest came speculation , he wondered who she was . he wondered where she had bought that excellently fitting suit of tailor made grey .
the burly gentleman , followed by the two armies of assistants . dropped down from the ring , and the gong sounded , mr. [male] from his corner as if somebody had touched a spring . he seemed to be of the opinion that if you are a cyclone . it is never too soon to begin behaving like one , he danced round the kid with an india rubber agility . the cosy moments representative exhibited more stolidity , except for the fact that he was in fighting attitude .
the wise donkey lived in a pretty little house away at the end of the valley . for he did not like to mix with the gay life at the court . he had not always been wise , but at one time was a very stupid donkey indeed . and he acquired his wisdom in this way . one friday afternoon , just as school was letting out , the stupid donkey strayed into the school house .
they got their supper and a nap . and about midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed the required conditions . we took possession of the well and its surroundings . my boys were experts in all sorts of things . from the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical instrument .
[male] felt that he was playing a part and the lines came quite naturally . he announced that all had a right to lead their own lives and looked at marjorie 's husband menacingly . as if daring him to doubt it , marjorie 's husband spoke of the sanctity of the home . forgetting that it had not seemed very holy to him lately ; [male] continued along the line of the right to happiness ', . marjorie 's husband mentioned firearms and the divorce court .
but the boy who can make fireworks is revered above all others as a boy belonging to a superior order of beings . the fifth of november was at hand . and with the consent of an indulgent mother . he determined to give to the world a proof of his powers . a large party of friends , relatives , and school mates was invited .
[female] wandered across to the other side of the house . his gloom visibly deepened , all alone in a strange school , where they probably played hopscotch . with a house master who offered one cups of tea after one 's journey and talked about chamfered plinths and apses . it was a little hard , he strayed about , finding his bearings . and finally came to a room which he took to be the equivalent of the senior day room at a wrykyn house .
mr. [male] , to adopt a technical term of elocution . has said a mouthful , whatever else the war did for us . it raised overnight an army of public speakers among the civilian population . many of whom seem not yet to have received their discharge , it is the aim of mr. [male] 's book to keep this landwehr in fighting trim and aid in recruiting its ranks . possibly against the next war , until every nation on earth has subjected its public speakers to a devastating operation on the larynx no true disarmament can be said to have taken place .
he looked for his watch beside it . but it was not there , what could have happened -- then he remembered that it was in its accustomed place in his waistcoat pocket . a consultation of it followed by holding it to his ear only revealed the fact that it had stopped at half past five . with the lucidity that was growing brighter in his brain . he concluded that this stoppage was due to the fact that he had not wound it up ...
steerforth , upon whom dickens evidently prided himself , i must confess , never laid hold of me . he is a melodramatic young man , the worst i could have wished him would have been that he should marry rose dartle and live with his mother . it would have served him right for being so attractive , old peggotty and ham are . of course , impossible , one must accept them also as types . these brothers cheeryble , these kits , [male] , boffins .
the most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of age . but i waited till i was sixteen , i do not know that i should have gone even then . if i had not happened to hear my old mother talk about setting me up on my own hook in the grocery way . the grocery way , -- only think of that , i resolved to be off forthwith . and try and establish myself in some decent occupation , without dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of these eccentric old people .
his rivals had all had to battle hard in their opening bouts . the tonbridgian 's rigidity had given place to spasmodic efforts to rise . he got on one knee , and his gloved hand roamed feebly about in search of a hold . it was plain that he had shot his bolt . the referee signed to his seconds , who ducked into the ring and carried him to his corner .
seeing my intentions thus defeated , i turned my head towards the shore . resolving to swim to land , to my surprise , i found that i made no progress . i put out all my strength -- i fought with the water . i threw myself forward -- it was in vain . i could not move a paw 's breadth against the current .
meanwhile the travellers approached ; among them came a woman on a pied horse . dressed in a travelling habit , and her face covered with a silk mask . either to conceal her features , or to shelter them from the effects of the sun and air . [male] pulled up his horse in the middle of the road . and remained with his face uncovered , awaiting the arrival of the cavalcade .
mrs lutterell will be so good as to accept my compliments . [female] , my love , and eloisa the best wishes for the recovery of her health and spirits that can be offered by her affectionate freind e. [female] . i am afraid this letter will be but a poor specimen of my powers in the witty way . and your opinion of them will not be greatly increased when i assure you that i have been as entertaining as i possibly could . my dear [female] we left lesley castle on the 28th of last month .
now i have only taken the test case of female suffrage because it is topical and concrete . it is not of great moment for me as a political proposal . i can quite imagine anyone substantially agreeing with my view of woman as universalist and autocrat in a limited area . and still thinking that she would be none the worse for a ballot paper . the real question is whether this old ideal of woman as the great amateur is admitted or not .
suppose , then , that every ailment which mr , [male] has traced to tobacco actually lies at its door . even then is the case for the prohibition of smoking persuasive ? of course . low scholarship is a fearful and humiliating thing , but we wonder whether it is more devastating than loneliness . it is better , we think , to have a little lassitude now and then . or even a touch of acid dyspepsia , than to be without the weed which gives `` one companionship when one has none . ''
the address which nelly had given her was on the east side of fifth avenue . she made her way along forty second street . it seemed the jolliest , alivest street she had ever encountered . the rattle of the elevated as she crossed sixth avenue was music . and she loved the crowds that jostled her with every step she took .
is lined with dark cloth and contains no machinery whatever beyond two pieces of steel . quadrant shaped , and situated one in each of the rear top corners of the compartment . a small protuberance about eight inches square . and also covered with dark cloth , lies on the floor of the compartment near the rear corner on the spectators ', left hand . leaving doors no , two and no , three open as well as the drawer .
his colour sickened more and more , he faded into age . and then his enemies began to show their deadly rage , they took a weapon long and sharp . and cut him by the knee , then tied him fast upon a cart . like a rogue for forgery , they laid him down upon his back . and cudgelled him full sore ; they hung him up before the storm .
five years ago , come next summer , the old lady made a trip to halifax . in one of our digby coasters , to see sister susannah . that is married in that city to ted [female] , the upholsterer . and took a whole lot of little notions with her to market to bear expenses . for she is a saving kind of body .
the lost children had not been found , public prayers had been offered up for them . and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioner 's whole heart in it . but still no good news came from the cave , the majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations . saying that it was plain the children could never be found , mrs. [female] was very ill . and a great part of the time delirious , people said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child .
and he turned a little paler when there came a sudden squall . for this funny little sailor was ridiculously small , and whene'er a storm portended he would betake himself below . so much fear and courage blended did a pirate ever show ? nursey declares i really must throw one of you away ; and you are the oldest . so i trust you will not care to stay , you have lost an arm .
[male] entangled in the dining room curtain . which yielded to his struggles and descended upon him and an old [location] bowl upon the sideboard . it was such a party as none of them had dreamed of . it was bliss undiluted , the house was full of shouting and yelling , of running to and fro of small boys mingled with subterranean murmurs of [female] 's rage . [female] was uttering horrible imprecations and hurling lumps of coal at the door .
he is better at the former , once i recollect driving down a steep black forest hill with a couple of ladies . it was one of those roads winding corkscrew wise down the slope . the hill rose at an angle of seventy five on the off side , and fell away at an angle of seventy five on the near side . we were proceeding very comfortably , the driver , we were happy to notice . with his eyes shut , when suddenly something , a bad dream or indigestion , awoke him .
the students work all day in the fields . the nurseries , and the shearing sheds , learning and doing all the practical work of the business . three days in a week , on the other three they study and hear lectures . they are taught the beginnings of such sciences as bear upon agriculture . like chemistry , for instance , we saw the sophomore class in sheep shearing shear a dozen sheep .
at the close of each day 's diary . the same dismal silence followed , when at last he finished his tale and sprung the indelicate surprise which is wont to fetch a crash of laughter . not a ripple of sound resulted , it was as if the tale had been told to dead men . after what seemed a long , long time , somebody sighed , somebody else stirred in his seat . presently , the men dropped into a low murmur of confidential talk .
so the thing was done , and the double dose put within the person of penrod schofield . it proved not ineffective there , and presently , as its new owner sat morosely at table . he began to feel slightly dizzy and his eyes refused him perfect service . this was natural , because two tablespoons of the cloudy brown liquor contained about the amount of alcohol to be found in an ordinary cocktail . now a boy does not enjoy the effects of intoxication .
female society gives men a taste for cleanliness and elegance of person . our ancestors , who kept but little company with their women . were not only slovenly in their dress , but had their countenances disfigured with long beards . by female influence , however , beards were , in process of time . mutilated down to mustaches , as the gentlemen found that the ladies had no great relish for mustaches .
a little study will be necessary before laying out the court , i mean you can not just go out and mark a court by guess work . you must first learn what the dimensions are supposed to be and get as near to them as is humanly possible . whereas there might be a slight margin for error in some measurements . it is absolutely essential that both sides are the same length . otherwise you might end up by lobbing back to yourself if you got very excited .
dear sir : -- this will be your pay for chickens and other fowls received up to the first of the present month . time is working wondrous changes in your chickens . they are not such chickens as we used to get of you before the war . they may be the same chickens , but oh , how changed by the lapse of time ! how much more indestructible , how they have learned since then to defy the encroaching tooth of remorseless ages .
no , i had been going cautiously all the while , i had had confidential agents trickling through the country some time . whose office was to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees . and to gnaw a little at this and that and the other superstition , and so prepare the way gradually for a better order of things . i was turning on my light one candle power at a time . and meant to continue to do so , i had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom .
one of the ways in which the torture was formerly administered in [location] . was by making the patient swallow pieces of gauze in water . silly pate , silly pate , why run on at this rate ? no tripping . or slipping , or sliding , have trusty assurance , and patient endurance and ever be person and confiding . to ugly suspicion refuse all admission , nor let it your better sense twist over .
the chief engineer has been in the [location] and [location] trade thirty three years . and has had but three christmases at home in that time . conversational items at dinner , mocha ! sold all over the world ! it is not true , in fact , very few foreigners except the emperor of [location] have ever seen a grain of it . or ever will , while they live , '' another man said : `` there is no sale in [location] for australian wine .
or does he -- yes , that must be it does he spend the year in training . in keeping down his figure ? chimney work is terribly trying . the figure wants watching if one is to carry it through successfully , this is especially so in the case of jolly old gentlemen with white beards . i can see father christmas , as soon as his day is over . taking himself off to the equator and running round and round it .
[male] made his way into piccadilly , and found that thoroughfare a roar with happy automobilists and cheery pedestrians . their gaiety irritated him , he resented their apparent enjoyment of life . [male] 's was not a nature that lent itself readily to introspection . but he was putting himself now through a searching self examination which was revealing all kinds of unsuspected flaws in his character . he had been having too good a time for years past to have leisure to realise that he possessed any responsibilities .
the result of an anxious consideration of these various opinions . was a conviction that to define wit was like the attempt to define beauty . which , said the philosopher , was the question of a blind man ', . and despairing , therefore , of finding a standard of value . the compiler of the following pages has gathered from every available source the odd sayings of all times .
lloyd , the man who will insure anything except the prospects for the sale of this book . lorelei , said to be a beautiful german lady who always hides herself when the tourist goes down the rhine . lot , mrs. , the only woman who had an inquisitiveness which became practical . she also was considered one of the salt of the earth . [female] [location] , 1785 1795 , the only [male] who did not live long enough to have the good times of his ancestors .
`` not even this house is mine till i can prove him dead , '' he snarled , and slammed the door behind him so that the windows in the attic rattled . night had long fallen ; long ago the lamps and the shop fronts had begun to glitter down the endless streets . the lobby was pitch -- dark ; and . as the devil would have it , [male] barked his shins and sprawled all his length over the pedestal of hercules .
[male] had nothing more , at the moment , to say . two or three canvases stood in the corner behind [male] 's chair . their faces turned to the wall , he pulled them out and began to look at the paintings . `` may i see too ? '' [male] requested , he stood them in a row against the wall . [female] had to turn round in her chair to look at them .
for a moment there was a pause and a silence of utter astonishment . while the minds of those who had witnessed the affair adjusted themselves to the marvel . and then the world became full of starting eyes , yelling throats . and clutching hands , from all over the casino fresh units swarmed like bees to swell the crowd at the centre of things . promenaders ceased to promenade , waiters to wait , elderly gentlemen sprang on to tables .
[female] , the second son , had been placed in his father 's office . and he also had died before the time at which our story is supposed to commence . he had been a poor sickly creature , always ailing , gifted with an affectionate nature . and a great respect for the blood of the mackenzies . but not gifted with much else that was intrinsically his own , the blood of the mackenzies was .
there is an old fellow named mark , who lives in a tree in the park . you can see him each night . by his library light , turning over the leaves after dark . where is the man who has not said at evening , when he went to bed . `` i will waken with the crowing cock , and get to work by six o'clock ? ''
he then considered within himself that it would be impossible to find the gentleman to whom the horse belonged that night . and , having bought a new band box for his mother 's bonnet . he rode home to clapham , put the horse in a butcher 's stable . gave it some corn , had his own supper . and went to bed dreadfully tired , in the morning he got up early , wrote an advertisement about the horse .
the strokes , here , are very firm and bold -- every nail head is a portrait . the handle on the end of the trunk has evidently been retouched . i think , with a piece of chalk -- but one can still see the inspiration of the old master in the tranquil . almost too tranquil , hang of it , the hair of this trunk is real hair . so to speak -- white in patches , brown in patches , the details are finely worked out .
[female] has been calling to me of late , i see the blue garonne winding among the vineyards and the bluer ocean toward which its waters sweep . i see the old town also , and the bristle of masts from the side of the long stone quay . my heart hungers for the breath of my native air and the warm glow of my native sun . here in [location] are my friends , my occupations , my pleasures . there all who have known me are in their grave , and yet the southwest wind as it rattles on my windows seems always to be the strong voice of the motherland calling her child back to that bosom into which i am ready to sink .
roland was to learn , as the days went on , that in the world in which he was moving everything was real revue that was not a stunt or a corking effect . he floundered in a sea of real revue . stunts , and corking effects , as far as he could gather . the main difference between these things was that real revue was something which had been stolen from some previous english production . whereas a stunt or a corking effect was something which had been looted from [location] .
`` i can not drop it , '' she said . through her tears , `` then what are we to do ? '' as he asked this question . he approached her and put his arm round her waist . this he did in momentary vacillating mercy . not because of the charm of the thing to himself .
this is one of the little dramas that take place every hour in this gilded [female] . and i describe it in detail only because i chanced to be present at the first scene and the last . sometimes the dramas become tragedies . and the administration , who do all things handsomely , pay the funeral expenses . and beg as a slight acknowledgment of their considerate generosity that as little noise as possible may follow the echo of the pistol shot .
but i did not , and i relied some on the bretheren . [male] dretful wild all the forepart of the night . he would lay still for a few minutes , and then he would get all rousted up . and he would set up in bed and call out some words in that strange tongue . and he would lift up his poor weak right arm .
the distance from [female] 's to the town was a mile and a half . if he started at the hour when he should have been starting for [organization] . he would arrive just in time to see the curtain go up . having settled these facts definitely in his mind , he got his books together and went over to school . fenn arrived at the theatre a quarter of an hour before the curtain rose .
[male] was delighted with his progress , and quoted [male] volubly in his admiration . [male] and francis added their tribute . and the knife and boot boy paid him the neatest compliment of all by refusing point blank to have any more dealings with him whatsoever . his professional duties , explained the knife and boot boy . did not include being punched in the heye by blokes , and he did not intend to be put upon .
he could not stick the thing at any price . and i had been living ever since in an atmosphere of bally disapproval till i was getting jolly well fed up with it . what i mean is , while there 's no doubt that in certain matters of dress [male] 's judgment is absolutely sound and should be followed . it seemed to me that it was getting a bit too thick if he was going to edit my face as well as my costume . no one can call me an unreasonable chappie .
i scribbled a few lines , likening the scattered clouds to brides blushing at the approach of the bridegroom . that would have been all right if later on they had not begun to turn green . it seemed the wrong colour for a bride . later on still they went yellow , and that spoilt the simile past hope . one can not wax poetical about a bride who at the approach of the bridegroom turns first green and then yellow .
through the influence of his father and [male] . [male] , the chief culprit , was not imprisoned , but compelled to pay a fine of one pound ten . he did not have but three shillings , yet the boys secretly passed the hat around in the court yard and tavern . and soon extricated our chum from the toils of sir [male] . [male] did not have the courage to face his wife after a week 's absence .
nor would this chronicle be complete without a passing reference to the lady from [location] . a widow of independent means , who was traveling with her two daughters and was so often mistaken for their sister that she could not refrain from mentioning the remarkable circumstance to you . providing you did not win her everlasting regard by mentioning it first . likewise i feel that i owe the tribute of a line to the elderly [location] who was engaged in a constant and highly successful demonstration of the fallacy of the claim set up by medical practitioners . to the effect that the human stomach can contain but one fluid pint at a time .
he took an old stick and poked at a worm . and merrily chuckled to see the thing squirm ; when he chanced to look up . and in gorgeous array triangular tilly was coming his way . triangular [male] straightened up in a jiff , and put on his best manner , exceedingly stiff . and as far as his angular shape would allow triangular [male] made a beautiful bow .
i had heard some sioux , and learned a few irrelevant and disconnected ute phrases . i connected these with some spanish terms and hoped to get a reply . and keep up a kind of running conversation that might mislead a friend who was with me . into the belief that i was as familiar with the indian tongue as with my own . i began conversing with him in my polyglot manner .
as the market place opened before him he saw count [male] . that distinguished foreigner , standing and smoking in elegant meditation at the corner of the local cafe . he immediately made his way rapidly towards him . considering that a consultation was urgent , but he had hardly crossed half of that stony quadrangle when a window burst open above him and a head was thrust out , shouting . the man was in his woollen undershirt .
he was within some fifty yards of the gate where the bindles awaited him . when there was a terrific crash followed by a mighty roar . the bull was through , it had retreated apparently in order to charge the hedge and break through by virtue of its mighty bulk . [female] , mrs. [female] . and mr. [male] gave one wild look over his shoulder and .
answer , no , it is nothing that he has eaten . it 's about her , the blow has come . she has no use for sunburn . does not care for tan ; she is going to marry a duke and the boy lieutenant is no longer in it . the real trouble is that the modern novelist has got beyond the happy marriage mode of ending .
medical humbugs constitute a very critical subject indeed , because i shall be almost certain to offend some of three parties concerned , namely . physicians , quacks , and patients . but it will never do to neglect so important a division of my whole theme as this . to begin with , it is necessary to suggest , in the most delicate manner in the world . that there is a small infusion of humbug among the very best of the regular practitioners .
he did not have his arm around myrtle , but he had it extended in a line parallel with her back . what he had done would not justify a girl in saying , `` sir ! '' but it started a real scandal with fred and eustace . they saw that the only way to get even with her was to go home without saying `` good night '' so they slipped out the side door .
the distance separating him from [male] was little over a dozen yards . a roar of applause greeted the runners as they started on the second lap . and it was significant that while [male] 's supporters shouted . well run ' , those of drake were fain to substitute advice for approval . and cry go it ' , drake , however .
nor did i forget to call up my friend in need and friend indeed in the toll house at the bridge . i stayed three or four days in windsor . finding it really a charming place , and i was almost sorry to leave it . but my only purpose in going there , that is to revisit the prison , was accomplished . and i started for [location] , and went from there to port [male] .
niklausse looked at his friend , his friend had never said so much at once . at least , without taking time , and giving long intervals between his sentences . it seemed to him that van tricasse expressed himself with a certain volubility . which was by no means common with him , niklausse himself experienced a kind of irresistible desire to talk . as for doctor ox , he looked at the burgomaster with sly attention .
with this he pulled the trigger , the powder exploded . the string binding the long black spring into a coil broke . and immediately the strip of steel shot forth into the air . made directly toward the neck of the rushing moose , and coiling its whole sinuous length tightly about the doomed creature 's throat strangled him to death . as the twins father said , a feat of that kind entitled the baron to a high place in fiction at least .
so each to his business , and his handbook to each -- how to write for the press to the special representative . and how to be an author to the author , there is no book . i believe , called how to be a solicitor , or a doctor or an admiral or a brewer . that is a different matter altogether ; but any fool can write for the papers . my first introduction to lady nicotine was at the innocent age of eight .
if he was fat , unmistakably and conclusively fat and he was -- what then was i ? in troy weight -- troy where the hay scales come from . the answer was written , i was fat as fat . or else the machine had lied , and as between me and that machine i could pick the liar at the first pick . that night on the sleeper a splendid resolution sprouted within me .
[male] threw down the stump of his cigar . and grunted irritably , inside charing cross station business was proceeding as usual , porters wheeling baggage trucks moved to and fro like juggernauts . belated trains clanked in , glad to get home . while others , less fortunate , crept reluctantly out through the blackness and disappeared into an inferno of detonating fog signals . for outside the fog still held , the air was cold and raw and tasted coppery .
`` not to me , they do not , '' [male] snaps . also sounding as if they better had not , i go over to play with the little kittens . the marmalade colored one is the strongest of the litter , and he 's learned to climb out of the box . he chases my fingers , [female] finishes feeding the big cats . and she strides over and scoops him back into the box .
he had some reason to be gruff , for if he had passed the day in a waterfall . he could scarcely have been wetter than he was , he was wrapped up to the eyes in a rough blue sailor 's coat . and had an oil skin hat on , from the capacious brim of which the rain fell trickling down upon his breast . and back , and shoulders , judging from a certain liveliness of chin . he had so pulled down his hat , and pulled up his collar .
wander as you will through the novels of the year . i assure you that things will be found to be about the same . of course , it is possible now and again to get away from the stale beer . but once a story enters prohibition time the study of starved souls and complexes begins . there are also books in which there is not any mud , but these pay particular attention to the stifling dust .
i will be one of any three to meet behind a barn and admit that i would not give a good gosh darn if a fortune teller were to tell me tomorrow that i should never . never have a chance to read another book by the great spanish novelist . any of the [location] reading public who desire to join this secret society may do so without fear of publicity . as the names will not be given out , the only means of distinguishing a fellow member will be a tiny gold emblem . to be worn in the lapel , representing the figure of [location] 's most touted animal .
the appointed hour arrived , o'leary arranged his orthodox wig , put on his sunday suit of sable . and sallied forth with all collected gravity of a man fully conscious of the novelty and responsibility of the affair in which he was engaged . he arrived at the appointed place of meeting some minutes after the fixed time . and was told that a respectable clergyman awaited his arrival in an adjoining parlor . o'leary enters the room , where he finds .
and yet [location] is famous all over the world , no [location] ever came to [location] without dropping off there to have a look . i once saw the bal tabarin crowded with sunday school superintendents returning from jerusalem . and when the sucker gets home he goes around winking and hinting . and so the fake grows , i often think the government ought to take a hand . if the beer is inspected and guaranteed in [location] , why should not the shows be inspected and guaranteed in [location] ?
he felt very lonely and dismal , he was not a man with many friends . in fact , barry and the other three were almost the only members of the house with whom he was on speaking terms . and of these four he saw very little , drummond and barry were always out of doors or over at the gymnasium . and as for m'todd and [male] bertini . it was not worth while talking to the one , and impossible to talk to the other .
they had a famous fried egg feast that night . and another on friday morning , after breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar . and chased each other round and round , shedding clothes as they went . until they were naked , and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar . against the stiff current , which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun .
remember , it is not the punishment of a prize fight for which i yearn . but the effulgent glory of meeting you in the ring . and having the cables and the press associate my budding name with that of a man who has done so much to make men better . a man whose name will go down to posterity as that of one who sought to ameliorate and mellow and desiccate his fellow men . i will now challenge you once more , with great respect .
the hair , of that soft blonde colour . seen oftenest upon the heads of children , and rarely upon adults . was thick and fine , and long enough to frame the handsome face in close half rings that no barber 's skill could ever subdue or make straight . the hands were long , slender , and soft as a woman 's . the feet small and arched , and the form beneath the loose outlines of the blue flannel fatigue suit in which it was clad .
the names of this noble five who never forgot the duty of the subject . or swerved from their attachment to his majesty , were as follows -- the king himself . ever stedfast in his own support -- archbishop laud . [location] of strafford , viscount faulkland and duke of ormond . who were scarcely less strenuous or zealous in the cause , while the villians of the time would make too long a list to be written or read .
thus punch , as it often does , voiced the sentiments of the nation on learning the death of its hero . the people of lugano , more especially the hotel keepers . were much exercised at this undertaking , nobody in recent recollection had been known to spend the night on [location] . and if the eccentricity were permitted and proved enjoyable , no one could say that it might not spread . leaving empty beds at lugano , there was , accordingly , much stress laid on possible dangers and certain discomforts .
now it so happened that there came one day to the door a drosky . or one horse carriage , and in it was a man and beside him a girl . the man stopped to ask the way from [female] . who pointed down the post road over the plain . but his hand trembled and his knees shook as he showed the way .
there is a never failing fascination in a man with a secret , it gave me a pleasant feeling of being behind the scenes . to watch malim , sitting in his armchair , the essence of everything that was conventional and respectable . with eton and oxford written all over him . and to think that he was married all the while to an employee in a tottenham court road fried fish shop . kit never appeared in the flat : but malim went nearly every evening to the little villa .
dead pete came to life , general villa and the [location] leader and a number of others strolled over towards the boss . who stood beside the fence vociferating his comments , `` that wo not do , '' he was shouting . `` that wo not do , where in blazes was that infernal sister of mercy , miss jenkinson ! '' and he called to a tall girl , whom i now noticed for the first time among the crowd . wearing a sort of khaki costume and a short skirt and carrying a water bottle in a strap .
but somehow nothing ever went right with the good little boy . nothing ever turned out with him the way it turned out with the good little boys in the books . they always had a good time , and the bad boys had the broken legs . but in his case there was a screw loose somewhere , and it all happened just the other way . when he found jim [male] stealing apples .
mme , [female] , much misrepresented as are all who are embarrassed with world wide popularity always considers when designing fashions that women vary in form . as in mood , she suits all needs . although this fact has never been cast to her credit . with a beautiful sense of adjustment -- as obvious as that in nature . that projects the huge watermelon to ripen on a slender vine on the ground and swings a greengage plum on the stout stem of a tree to mature in storm or shine , [female] .
as we passed through the dim and dust covered buildings i looked curiously at the figures in the cases , i didn t in the least understand what the man meant . but had no time to question him , for at that moment we came out upon the street . and i stood riveted in astonishment , broadway , was it possible ? the change was absolutely appalling , in place of the roaring thoroughfare that i had known .
when he blew off it was super heated steam and you could see the sinners who were in range fairly sizzle and parboil and shrivel up . there was no give in doc ; no compromises with creditors . no fire sales , he was not one of those elders who would let a fellow dance the lancers if he would swear off on waltzing . or tell him it was all right to play whist in the parlor if he would give up penny ante at the dutchman 's . or wink at his smoking if he would quit whisky .
but this frigid theory of the beautiful has not succeeded in conquering the art of the world . except in name , in some quarters , indeed , it has never held sway . a glance at chinese dragons or japanese gods will show how independent are orientals of the conventional idea of facial and bodily regularity . and how keen and fiery is their enjoyment of real beauty . of goggle eyes , of sprawling claws , of gaping mouths and writhing coils .
moses kept [location] not long in suspense . his rifle was already charged , and he fixed it upon the target with a steadiness of nerve and aim that was astonishing to me and alarming to all the rest . a few seconds , and the report of his rifle broke the deathlike silence which prevailed . `` no great harm done yet , '' said spivey , manifestly relieved from anxiety by an event which seemed to me better calculated to produce despair . firmby 's ball had cut out the lower angle of the diamond .
woman wants to take the stick now , and put man on the doorstep . there are one or two things she has got to say to him . he is not at all the man she approves of . he must begin by getting rid of all his natural desires and propensities . that done , she will take him in hand and make of him .
or , indeed , intended she should : for they proceeded with great caution . lest she should be offended , and acquaint mr allworthy . but they had no reason for any such fear . she was well enough pleased with a passion , of which she intended none should have any fruits but herself . and the only fruits she designed for herself were .
the woman clothed with the sun will be a portrait of mrs. [female] . is it insanity to believe that christian scientism is destined to make the most formidable show that any new religion has made in the world since the birth and spread of mohammedanism . and that within a century from now it may stand second to rome only , in numbers and power in christendom ? if this is a wild dream it will not be easy to prove it is so just yet , i think . there seems argument that it may come true , the christian science `` boom '' is not yet five years old .
i do not know what it was which made me so anxious to learn the name and rank of the lady doggess who had been the cause of my severe punishment . but i eagerly inquired of a kind mongrel , who stopped to help me collect my scattered goods . if he knew anything about her , he said . she was called lady bull ; that her husband . sir [male] , had made a large fortune somehow .
118 , a melting sermon being preached in a country church . all fell a weeping but one man , who being asked , why he did not weep with the rest , o ! said he , i belong to another parish , 119 , a gentlewoman growing big with child . who had two gallants , one of them with a wooden leg . the question was put , which of the two should father the child , he who had the wooden leg offer would to decide it thus .
really , this article could run on forever , there 's that particularly manlike attitude of accusing women of slavishly following the fashions ! funny , is not it , when you think about it ? do you think a man would wear a striped tie with a morning coat when his haberdasher says others are wearing plain gray ? or a straw hat before the fifteenth of may ? have you ever watched the mental struggle between a dinner suit and evening clothes ? do you suppose that women , realizing that the costume they wore was the ugliest ever devised .
some men would have dismissed the unfortunate affairs of mr. [male] from their mind as having nothing to do with themselves . but archie had never been made of this stern stuff , the fact that mr. [male] . apart from being an agreeable companion with whom he had lunched occasionally in [location] . had no claims upon him affected him little . he hated to see his fellowman in trouble .
the overhanging trees and bushes , the tangled vines and creepers they were rooting up and trimming down . a little further i came upon the finished work -- [location] as it ought to be . according to german ideas , the water , now a broad , sluggish stream . flowed over a level , gravelly bed , between two walls crowned with stone coping . at every hundred yards it gently descended down three shallow wooden platforms .
the common pantomime seems like some horrible satiric picture of a world without cause or effect . a mass of `` jarring atoms , '' a prolonged mental torture of irrelevancy , the ordinary farce seems a world of almost piteous vulgarity . where a half witted and stunted creature is afraid when his wife comes home . and amused when she sits down on the doorstep , all this is , in a sense .
a strolling band of comic , and punch and judy players had made a sudden invasion of stratford and established themselves in the big barn of the old bear tavern on bridge street . the town was alive with expectation and the school children were wild to behold the great play of `` the scolding wife , '' which was advertised through the streets , in the daytime , by a cartload of bedizened harlequins . belaboring each other with words and gestures , the wife with bare arms . short dress and a bundle of rods .
though i was not so fortunate as to be favoured with an answer to the letter with which i troubled you in the spring . i still flatter myself that you retain some regard for me and my concerns . i am sure the care and tenderness with which i was treated . under your roof and tuition , demand the warmest returns of gratitude and affection on my part . and these sentiments , i hope , i shall cherish to my dying day -- at present .
no ; she was not physically ill ; the trouble was deeper -- soul sickness . acute , threatening to become chronic , that defied allopathic doses of favorite and other philosophers . that would not yield even to hourly repetition of the formula handed down from her grandmother -- if you can not have what you want , try to want what you have . yet she could lay her finger on no bleeding heart wound .
she hesitated , but i stamped my foot and called them forth in so imperious a manner that they came at once . they would be safer in the chapel , and thither i led them . placing them at the end which was farthest from the magazine . as the three nuns took their places before the altar my heart bounded with joy and pride within me . for i felt that the last obstacle had been lifted from my path .
the dignified person had then retreated downstairs slowly , and what was taking place for the next half hour poor mrs mackenzie . in the agony of her mind , could not surmise , she longed to go and see . but did not dare , even for dr slumpy , or even for his wife . had they been alone with her she would not have cared much , [female] colza she could have treated with perfect indifference . could even have taken her down into the kitchen with her , [female] , her own junior partner .
the things philanthropists barely excuse in the life of the laboring classes are simply the things we have to excuse in all the greatest monuments of man . it may be that the laborer is as gross as [male] or as garrulous as homer . that if he is religious he talks nearly as much about hell as dante . that if he is worldly he talks nearly as much about drink as dickens . nor is the poor man without historic support if he thinks less of that ceremonial washing which [male] dismissed .
but , after all , there was nothing she would not have done to compass the gratification of the desires that had laid hold on her soul and body . and were undermining her very bones and marrow , the bargain was struck ; and quitting the room to go and speak to her mistress . she found all the rest of the women assembled round the door . putting a bold face on the matter , she bade them all go to bed . and next night they should be able to enjoy themselves without any such false alarm as had spoiled their sport for that time .
and so golf came to oom , and with it prosperity unequalled in the whole history of the land . everybody was happy , there was no more unemployment , crime ceased . the chronicler repeatedly refers to it in his memoirs as the golden age . and yet there remained one man on whom complete felicity had not descended , it was all right while he was actually on the linx . but there were blank , dreary stretches of the night when king merolchazzar lay sleepless on his couch and mourned that he had nobody to love him .
i could not just reconcile those statements with [male] 's face . but i accepted him at par and had him passed along to the head errand boy . his mother cried a little when she saw him marched off . and asked me to see that he was treated kindly and was not bullied by the bigger boys . because he had been `` raised a pet , '' along toward noon .
the body of [male] had been scarcely cold in death when lord [male] and the royal council proclaimed [male] of [location] . king of england , [location] , [location] and [male] . tumbling over each other in a mad race to throw themselves prostrate before the rising sun . forgetting in a day the honors and benefactions showered upon them for forty years by their late mistress . king [male] left edinburgh on the 5th of april with a royal escort for [location] .
it , of course , depended a good deal on the extemporaneous affidavit qualifications of the applicant . about five years ago an acquaintance came to me and said he wanted to get a pension from the government . and that he had not the first idea about the details . he did not know whether he should apply to the president or to the secretary of state . would i `` kind of put him onto the racket. ''
in [location] the house of lords is composed of princes and peers . with an admixture of bishops , brewers , and other political party pullers . it is also an asylum for stranded political wrecks from the lower house . soldiers and sailors , too , are honoured and are sent there , not as politicians . but merely to exist for the time being in a sort of respectable retreat .
enter the opulent [location] gentleman . half a dozen functionaries greet him rapturously . bowing before his triumphant progress , others relieve him of his hat and his coat . so that he can not escape prematurely , a whole reception committee escorts him to a place of honor facing the dancing arena . the natives of the quarter stand in rows in the background .
suppose you try that , [female] . [female] . one of the very successful humorists of the day , both in a literary and financial way . was blown up by a steamboat before he bloomed forth into the full flush and power of success . try that , [male] , it is a severe test . but it is bound to be a success , even if it should be disastrous to you .
the house boat of the associated shades , formerly located upon the river styx . as the reader may possibly remember , had been torn from its moorings and navigated out into unknown seas by that vengeful pirate [female] . aided and abetted by some of the most ruffianly inhabitants of hades , like a thief in the night had they come . and for no better reason than that the [female] had been unanimously voted a shade too shady to associate with self respecting spirits had they made off with the happy floating club house of their betters . and worst of all , with them , by force of circumstances over which they had no control .
so they deliberately couched the address in terms that were just as reassuring as possible and the prince was simply delighted with it . i am certain that he slept pretty soundly after hearing that address , why , you could see it taking effect even on his aides de camp and the people round him . so imagine how the prince must have felt , i think in mariposa they understand kings perfectly . every time that a king or a prince comes . they try to make him see the bright side of everything and let him think that they are all united .
only one sixteenth of her was black , and that sixteenth did not show , she was of majestic form and stature . her attitudes were imposing and statuesque , and her gestures and movements distinguished by a noble and stately grace . her complexion was very fair , with the rosy glow of vigorous health in her cheeks . her face was full of character and expression . her eyes were brown and liquid , and she had a heavy suit of fine soft hair which was also brown .
on halloween night great care should be taken in the preparations for receiving the guests in a mystic manner . no pains should be spared in the effort to start the evening off with a `` bang . '' several novel ideas are offered for starting the guests off on the right informal spirit . before they arrive , it is a good plan to take the street number off your house and fasten it to the porch of your next door neighbors . who will , of course , be at home because they are perfectly impossible people whom no one would invite anywhere .
she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit . she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable . and could accompany her own voice well , one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize . a second , slightly but correctly taken by [female] churchill , her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song . and every thing usual followed , he was accused of having a delightful voice .
more moved by the words than he would have confessed , [male] watched the bent figure move through the door and out into the sunshine . and afterward , banishing the seriousness of his mood , he climbed the hill to the white cottage . there to evolve with delight a plot that should hold the men of the [male] household captive long enough for [male] and himself to attach to [male] motor boat the new invention . three feverish days passed , days of constant hard work and myriad trivial annoyances . a train of misadventures had attended the transference of [male] 's `` idee '' to [male] boat .
and he went back to his exercises , looking puzzled and pained , the fact was . he was an ardent believer in the good boy of a certain order of school tales . the boy who is seized with a sudden conviction of the intrinsic baseness of boyhood . and does all in his power to get rid of the harmful taint ; the boy who renounces his old comrades and his natural tastes ( which after all seldom have any serious harm in them ) . to [male] a panoply of priggishness which is too often kick proof .
when i read of dotheboys [male] and salem house . a combination of which establishments formed my notion of school life . it was with no more personal interest than a cripple might feel in perusing the notice of an impending conscription . for from the battles of school life i was fortunately exempted . i was the only son of a widow .
but this was one of those headstrong rocking chairs that are a danger to humanity . and a nuisance to themselves , its notion was that it was made to rock . and that when it was not rocking , it was wasting its time . once started nothing could stop it -- nothing ever did stop it . until it found itself topsy turvy on its own occupant .
as a matter of fact , knights errant were not persons to be believed . that is , measured by modern standards of veracity ; yet , measured by the standards of their own time . and scaled accordingly , you got the truth , it was very simple . you discounted a statement ninety seven per cent . the rest was fact , now after making this allowance .
another rule of battle , that alice had not noticed . seemed to be that they always fell on their heads , and the battle ended with their both falling off in this way . side by side : when they got up again . they shook hands , and then the red knight mounted and galloped off . `` it was a glorious victory , was not it ? ''
at one o clock , the landlady would come in to ask if we weren t going out , as it seemed such a lovely day . and when the afternoon was nearly gone , and still there was no sign of rain . we tried to cheer ourselves up with the idea that it would come down all at once . just as the people had started for home , and were out of the reach of any shelter .
a fortnight after all we have said had taken place at calais . the whole troop assembled at the hague , then d'artagnan perceived that all his men . with remarkable intelligence , had already travestied themselves into sailors . more or less ill treated by the sea , d'artagnan left them to sleep in a den in newkerke street . whilst he lodged comfortably upon the grand canal , he learned that the king of england had come back to his old ally , [male] .
montgomery [female] was trying to gather himself together from within the fog which made himself and the world unreal . i believe i would like to have you read this extraor . the will , mr. [male] , he said , with an effort to hold his nerves in leash . mr. [male] cleared his throat and began in his still voice . once he looked up to find his listener eager .
returning to the big silent rooms above , [male] was utterly at a loss how to occupy himself . the thundering stillness got on his nerves and he found himself thinking of a dozen different things at once . but as idea pursued idea the image of the shy and winsome [male] persisted in intervening . so he dropped [male] , or rather the two [male] gladwins . [male] , [male] and all the others from his mind and gave himself up to the beatific contemplation of the picture that was most soothing to his spirits .
the soft speeches of the amorous dueña were distinctly heard by the group outside the door . and there was not one of them but bestowed a blessing upon her from the wrong side of the mouth . with the addition of sundry epithets which i had rather not repeat , the result of the confabulation between the pair was that loaysa would comply with the dueña 's desires . provided that first of all she brought her mistress to consent to his . it cost the dueña something to subscribe to these conditions .
the proceedings of the evening were opened by the higholdboy . who took his official seat , announced that the special order of the meeting was to hear the reports of members who had been present at the sessions of the police courts . with the view of noting down their zoölogical features , the higholdboy called upon dennis . wagstaff , and overdale for the result of their visit to the police courts . wagstaff 's notebook was produced , and the lengthened narratives inscribed therein went to show the following state of facts .
a tall man met me at the door and threw me about forty feet in an oblique manner . i asked him if he meant anything personal by that and he said not at all . not at all , i then asked him if he would not allow me to eat my dinner and he said that depended on what i wanted for my dinner . if i would lay down my arms and come back to the reservation and remain neutral to the government and eat cooked food . it would be all right , but if i insisted on eating raw dining room girls and scalloped young ladies .
when mr. [male] arrived at the excelsior and shortly after he was shown into the little private sitting room where he found [male] . the third guest of the evening unexpectedly arrived , mr. [male] looked curiously at the newcomer . [male] had a peculiar fascination for him . it was not mr. [male] 's habit to trust overmuch to appearances . but he could not help admitting that there was something about this man 's aspect which brought mrs. [female] 's charges out of the realm of the fantastic into that of the possible .
cecil frowned again , oh , these honeychurches , eggs , boilers . hydrangeas , maids -- of such were their lives compact . `` may me and [male] get down from our chairs ? '' he asked , with scarcely veiled insolence , `` we do not want no dessert . '' of course miss [female] accepted , and , equally of course .
but the laws , of which he is always the interpreter . are not so favorable to his wife ; they inflict a severe disgrace upon her . if she commit adultery with any of the higher casts ; but if with the lowest . the magistrate shall cut off her hair , anoint her body with ghee . and cause her to be carried through the whole city , naked , and riding upon an ass .
we came after a while to a sort of marshy lake . very big , so that the circling forest looked quite low and dim across it . our guide told [location] that boats could go from there to our camp . but `` long way -- all day , '' this water was somewhat clearer than that we had left . but we could not judge well from the margin , we skirted it for another half hour or so .
wall , the cars stopped in a pretty little village . a clean , pleasant little place as i ever see , or want to see . and josiah and me wended our way up the broad roomy street . up to where the monument seemed to sort a beegon to [location] to come . and when we got up to it ; we see it wuz a sight .
the horses were the weak feature of the expedition . it was two hundred miles to humboldt , mostly across sand . the miners rode only a little way , then got out to lighten the load . later they pushed , then it began to snow , also to blow , and the air became filled with whirling clouds of snow and sand . on and on they pushed and groaned , sustained by the knowledge that they must arrive some time .
at that time it had become my habit to begin my day by rising before breakfast and taking a swim in fermain bay . which lies across the road in front of our cottage . the practice -- i have since abandoned it . was good for the complexion , and generally healthy , i had kept it up . moreover , because i had somehow cherished an unreasonable but persistent presentiment that some day somebody would cross the pathway of my maiden existence .
[female] had inherited from his mother a pleasant . rather meek cast of countenance , he had pink cheeks and golden hair . almost indecently golden in one who was not a choirboy , now , if you are going to look like a ministering child or a little [male] . the sunbeam of the home , when you go to a public school . you must take the consequences , as [male] sat by the window of the junior day room reading a magazine .
this house is bigger than it looks , for it slides for two storeys down the hill behind . and the wooden door , which is always locked , really leads into the attic . the knowing person prefers to follow the precipitous mule track round the turn of the mud wall till he can take the edifice in the rear . then -- being now on a level with the cellars -- he lifts up his head and shouts . if his voice sounds like something light .
the queen remained a good while gazing on her without saying a word . figuring to herself , as she afterwards told her lady of the bed chamber . that she had before her a starry heaven . the stars of which were the many pearls and diamonds worn by isabella . her fair face and her eyes its sun and moon .
i did not like to question him on the subject . that showed my delicacy , mrs. [female] says i have no delicacy . she has not forgiven me about the mice . you see , when i was staying down there , a mouse used to cake walk about my room half the night . and none of their silly patent traps seemed to take its fancy as a bijou residence .
now lord [male] had been found out , he was quite sure of that , and he had to undergo all that was unpleasant without sufficient experience to tell him that those clouds too would pass away quickly . he still walked homewards acrossjames 's park . never stopping , but dragging himself along slowly , and when he came to his own door he let himself in very silently . she did not expect him so soon , and when he entered the drawing room was startled to see him . she had not as yet put the letter , as she had intended .
this scientific plan might have worked , in fact , to a certain extent it did work . it woke chapple in the morning . as [male] had predicted ; but it woke him at the wrong hour . it is no good springing out of bed when there are still three hours to breakfast . when chapple woke at five the next morning , after a series of dreams .
to this [male] replied by throwing himself at the feet of the duke . who raised him instantly , from your greatness and christian uprightness . most noble lord and dear brother , said [male] . `` my sister and i had certainly nothing less than this high honour to expect . '' saying this , tears came to his eyes , and the duke felt his own becoming moist .
he knew that , if he would free himself . this utterly unreasonable feeling must be wrestled with and overcome ; that now , if ever . was the time to assert himself , and prove that he was anything but the raw youth he was conscious of appearing . he had merely to speak and act , too , in his ordinary everyday manner . to forget as far as possible the change that had affected his outer man .
the series begins with the hiring of a `` bearer '' . native man servant -- a person who should be selected with some care , because as long as he is in your employ he will be about as near to you as your clothes . in [location] your day may be said to begin with the `` bearer 's '' knock on the bedroom door . accompanied by a formula of words -- a formula which is intended to mean that the bath is ready .
there is a beautiful little lake in the heart of the city on which small gaily painted boats dart to and fro carrying passengers like omnibuses in city streets . beautiful bridges cross the alster , a tributary of the danube . and tall handsome houses line the streets . they are great cases for flowers there in [location] . you meet flower shops and flower sellers on every side .
i have known the least the greatest , too -- and , on the selfsame plan . the biggest fool i ever knew was quite a little man . we find we ought , and then we wo not . we prove a thing , then doubt it . know everything but when we do not know anything about it .
a few minutes ago , and it would have seemed to paul so simple and easy a matter to point out to the doctor the very excusable error into which he had fallen . it was no more than he would have to do repeatedly upon his return . and here was an excellent opportunity for an explanation , but , somehow the words would not come . the schoolmaster 's form seemed so tremendous and towering . and he so feeble and powerless before him , that he soon persuaded himself that a public place .
he moved a bench under the trap . upon which soft shoes mounted , crouched , hesitated , crouched again , and then leaped amazingly upward . he caught at the edge of the aperture and swung back and forth . for a moment , shifting his hold ; finally doubled up and disappeared into the darkness above . there was a scurry , a migration of rats .
`` very good , sir , '' said the secretary , i waited for about an hour . wrote a few editorials advocating the rights of the people . smoked some turkish cigarettes , drank a glass of sherry . and ate part of an anchovy sandwich . then i rang the bell , bring that man here , ', i said .
all the doctor 's requirements were not at once fulfilled , mrs. [female] 's position was easily settled . mrs. [female] , who seemed to be a woman possessed of sterling sense and great activity . undertook her duties without difficulty , but mr. [male] would not at first consent to act as curate in the parish . he did , however , after a time perform a portion of the sunday services . when he first came to bowick he had declared that he would undertake no clerical duty .
it was marilla who spoke , alarm in every jerky word . [female] came through the [female] , her hands full of white narcissus . it was long before [female] could love the sight or odor of white narcissus again . in time to hear her and to see matthew standing in the porch doorway . a folded paper in his hand , and his face strangely drawn and gray .
they have always been driven to assume it through certain practical limitations of space and time . now it can be easily shown that the thing we call aristocracy in [location] is not in its origin and spirit an aristocracy at all . it is not a system of spiritual degrees and distinctions like . for example , the caste system of [location] . or even like the old greek distinction between free men and slaves .
the servants that upon her wait a pleasure have which must be great . and yet can we get none to stay , i grieve so when she goes away ! tears from my eyes her turned heels draw . oh , do not i love my mother in law , a sweet old soul . how pleased i feel to see her at the social meal of dinner sit .
with every bound my horse grew weaker , each instant the sound of the pursuit grew louder . i heard a gust of crackling german oaths at my very heels , a pistol bullet sighed in my ears . spurring frantically and beating my poor arab with the flat of my sword i kept him at the top of his speed . the open gate of the farm yard lay before me . i saw the twinkle of steel within , [male] 's horse 's head was within ten yards of me as i thundered through .
for the first time since the week of his marriage [male] grainger lived under a sky of unclouded tranquillity . with some alarm at the slowing up of the days and the accelerating of the years . [male] became thirty one , thirty two -- then almost with a rush arrived at that age which . with all its washing and panning , can only muster a bare handful of the precious stuff of youth . he became thirty five , and one day on fifth avenue he saw [male] .
over the mountains winding down , horse and foot . into [female] town , forty flags with their silver stars . forty flags with their crimson bars . flapped in the morning wind : the sun of noon looked down . and saw not one , up rose old [female] then , bowed with her fourscore years and ten .
he turned back ; he raised his eyes . there were the birds high above , still circling about , and [female] was at the threshold of the cabin . leaning against the jamb , her arms crossed , her head hanging . the poor woman was surely weeping , within him he felt a mute explosion of hatred and revolt against the ungrateful birds . never had he had the courage to kill a single one of them .
`` oh , bother my hat , i want [location] ! '' cried the little duke , laughing , and they galloped on to the railway station . there mr. [male] inquired of the station master if any one answering to the description of [location] had been seen on the platform . but could get no news of her , the station master . however , wired up and down the line , and assured him that a strict watch would be kept for her .
at last the company arrived at the secluded spot , and a ring was staked out . in a few moments the imported scrapper came into the ring . attended by the sporty undertaker , he wore an old pair of bike shoes and faded work trousers . chopped off at the knees , while his belt was a shawl strap . he was chewing gum , after he put on the gloves he looked over at the coming champion and remarked to the undertaker that he seemed to be a nice young fellow .
so lord howard passed away with five ships of war that day . till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven . but sir [male] bore in hand all his sick men from the land very carefully and slow . men of bideford in devon . and we laid them on the ballast down below .
with some difficulty he managed to pass into eton . and three years later -- with , one would imagine , still more difficulty -- managed to get superannuated . at cambridge he went down hill rapidly , he would think nothing of smoking a cigar in academical costume . and on at least one occasion he drove a dogcart on sunday . no wonder that he was requested , early in his second year .
wife : ( reads in an injured tone one and a half pages on the selective processes of pigeons ) . : you are asleep , husband : i am not . the last words you read were `` to this conclusion . '' wife : well , it 's very funny that you did not notice when i read the last sentence backwards . and if you were not asleep what were you doing with your eyes closed ?
it was the raft , and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again . we seen a light now away down to the right , on shore . so i said i would go for it , the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck . we hustled it on to the raft in a pile . and i told jim to float along down , and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile .
he gave a loud `` hurrah , '' picked up his sword . and fought his way back , the enemy hard after him . it was a race for life . and he ran backwards the whole way ; he was not going to turn his back to the enemy . he pressed on , shouting `` hurrah , '' till he got to his own side again .
in other words , percy was the worst of the lot . whatever indiscretions the rest had committed , at least they had never got the family into the comic columns of the evening papers . lord [location] might wear corduroy trousers and refuse to entertain the county at garden parties and go to bed with a book when it was his duty to act as host at a formal ball . [female] might give her heart to an impossible person whom nobody had ever heard of . and [male] might be seen at fashionable restaurants with pugilists .
the women have accomplished a peaceful revolution , and a very beneficent one ; and yet that has not convinced the average man that they are intelligent . and have courage and energy and perseverance and fortitude . it takes much to convince the average man of anything . and perhaps nothing can ever make him realize that he is the average woman 's inferior . yet in several important details the evidence seems to show that that is what he is .
yes , thirty two was a comparatively advanced age at that time , but then we got on to plays and books . and [male] shaw was doing all the timely hitting in the pinches . and , to mix the metaphor , breaking loose and running the length of the field . putting a straight arm into the faces of all who would tackle him , [male] started to blaze at the age of fifty . and [male] was the keenest of all the critics to hail anything in any art which was new and hitherto unclassified .
d'artagnan , although he flattered himself with better success . had , nevertheless , not too well comprehended his situation , it was a strange and grave subject for him to reflect upon . this voyage of athos into england . this league of the king with athos . and that extraordinary combination of his design with that of the comte [male] la fere .
under his spurning feet the road like an arrowy alpine river flowed . and the landscape sped away behind like an ocean flying before the wind . and the steed , like a bark fed with furnace fire . swept on , with his wild eye full of ire , but lo , he is nearing his heart 's desire . he is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray .
horatius , as he followed his plough on a warm day over the corn land which his gratified country bestowed on him for his masterly handling of the traffic on the bridge . must sometimes have felt it was a little tame , the feeling is far more acute when one has been unexpectedly baulked in one 's desire for action . sheen , for the first few days after he received drummond 's brief note . felt that it was useless for him to try to do anything . the fates were against him , in stories .
besides im gettin leery of these infantry [organization] . there always talking about what were goin to do to the germans , blowin em to pieces and slicin em up an throwin em all around the lot . i got [female] what if the germans was learnin there men to do the same thing . they never seem to figger on these things , an these baynuts , mable . they aint safe , when you get a lot of [organization] in a trench with there baynuts stickin every which way some ones goin to get hurt sure .
presently , lord dreever 's name came up , it caused a momentary pause . and mceachern took advantage of it , it was the cue for which he had been waiting . he hesitated for a moment , for the conversation was about to enter upon a difficult phase . and he was not quite sure of himself , then , he took the plunge . `` i have just been talking to sir [male] , my dear , '' he said .
julia , [male] dummkopf . a word with you , if you please , ern . beautiful english maiden -- [male] , no compliments , i beg . i desire to speak with you on a purely professional matter . so we will , if you please , dispense with allusions to my personal appearance .
he had been in the trade a long time . and , i may say , understood it , our general routine was this . pompey , having rolled himself well in the mud . sat upon end at the shop door . until he observed a dandy approaching in bright boots .
showing the truth of many observations of ovid . and of other more grave writers , who have proved beyond contradiction , that wine is often the forerunner of incontinency . [male] retired from the company , in which we have seen him engaged . into the fields , where he intended to cool himself by a walk in the open air before he attended mr allworthy . there , whilst he renewed those meditations on his dear sophia .
now begins the first chapter of the last of the d'artagnan romances . the vicomte person bragelonne , enjoy ! towards the middle of the month of may , in the year 1660 . at nine o'clock in the morning , when the sun . already high in the heavens , was fast absorbing the dew from the ramparts of the castle of blois .
man is a weak and pitiful dweller in a violent world and nothing has done so much to sharpen his wits as fear . probably he found fire because he feared the dark . surely he instituted law through distrust of his fellows . and fear must have been the first prompting toward religion , then , too , it seems more than likely that there would never have been a literature but for fear . primitive peoples liked to hear the stories of great heroes who did mighty deeds because such things served to cheer and inspirit them .
her heart leaped joyfully as she turned in at the drive gates of her home and felt the well-remembered gravel crunching under her feet . the silhouette of the ruined castle against the summer sky gave her the feeling which all returning wanderers know . and , when she stepped on to the lawn and looked at the black bulk of the house . indistinct and shadowy with its backing of trees , tears came into her eyes . she experienced a rush of emotion which made her feel quite faint .
he put up his hand and whispered an aside to miss [female] . `` revolutionized the theory of navigation , '' major benjy was certainly rather gay and rather indistinct . but his polite gallantry could not fail to be attractive , it was naughty of him to have said that he went to bed early on alternate nights . but really ... still , it might be better to slip away unrecognized , and , thinking it would be nice to scriggle by him and disappear in the mist . she made a tactical error in her scriggling .
if i could have leaped the hedge with a single debonair bound . that would have been satisfactory , but the hedge was high , and i did not feel capable at the moment of achieving a debonair bound over a footstool . the man saved the situation , he seemed to possess that magnetic power over his fellows which marks the born leader . under his command we became an organised army . the common object , the pursuit of the elusive aunt [female] .
she could afford to laugh at his ill humour , she had his promise of obedience . she told him to say something graceful and simple . the noise of the violin had ceased , there was not a breath of wind . the crowd in the quadrangle was as still and as silent as the night itself . nowhere a tremour , and it was borne in on zuleika that this crowd had one mind as well as one heart .
next sunday the preacher stepped softly to a back room door to see if the children were rightly employed . he peeped in , a chair occupied the middle of the room . and on the back of it hung [male] 's cap . one of his little sisters took the cap down , nibbled at it . then passed it to another small sister and said , eat of this fruit .
gold watch chains do not . the point is not that we have lost the material hues . but that we have lost the trick of turning them to the best advantage . we are not like children who have lost their paint box and are left alone with a gray lead pencil . we are like children who have mixed all the colors in the paint box together and lost the paper of instructions .
he threw the whole of these treasures out of the window with indescribable disgust . and , feeling something like a purse in a side pocket . opened it eagerly , it held five shillings exactly . the coins corresponding to those he had pushed across to his son such a little while ago ! it did not seem to him quite such a magnificent sum now as it had done then .
in the scene that ensued i did not take a hand . but the floor it was strewed like the leaves on the strand with the cards that ah sin had been hiding in the game `` he did not understand . '' in his sleeves , which were long , he had twenty-four packs . which was coming it strong , yet i state but the facts . and we found on his nails , which were taper , what is frequent in tapers .
some ragged curs arrived , and carried the old doggess away , she was very heavy . and they were forced to use all their strength , i saw her cast into the water . which she disliked so much alive ; i watched her floating form until the rapid current bore it into the wood . and i stayed sitting on the brink of the river wondering where it would reach at last . and what sort of places must lie beyond the trees .
in all these , however , and in every other similitude of life to the theatre . the resemblance hath been always taken from the stage only . none , as i remember , have at all considered the audience at this great drama . but as nature often exhibits some of her best performances to a very full house . so will the behaviour of her spectators no less admit the above mentioned comparison than that of her actors .
an inverted white soup plate was lying miraculously balanced upon the back of a pew a little distance in front of him . and upon the upturned bottom of the soup plate was a brown cocoanut . mildly surprised , penrod yawned , and , in the effort to straighten his eyes . came to life temporarily , the cocoanut was revealed as georgie [organization] 's head . and the soup plate as georgie 's white collar , georgie was sitting up straight .
he put in a generous charge from jim 's powder flask and rammed it home with a paper wad . he grabbed up the shot pouch and released the proper charge into his hand . he was disappointed ; it was bird shot . scattering as it would scatter , it could do that cat no harm . nevertheless , he poured the pellets into the barrel .
he would have to separate the combatants , and who knew whether , in their very natural chagrin at being interrupted . they might not turn their combined pistols on him first . and settle with each other afterwards ? one murder the more made little difference to desperate men . other shocks , less deadly but extremely unnerving , might await him , he might be too late . and pop his head over the edge of one of these craters .
for chairman they picked an old flongboo who was an umpire and used to umpire many mix ups . among the flongboos he was called `` the umpire of umpires , '' `` the king of umpires , '' `` the prince of umpires , '' `` the peer of umpires , '' when there was a fight and a snag and a wrangle between two families living next door neighbors to each other and this old flongboo was called in to umpire and to say which family was right and which family was wrong . which family started it and which family ought to stop it .
ay , tear her tattered ensign down , long has it waved on high , and many an eye has danced to see that banner in the sky . beneath it rung the battle shout . and burst the cannon 's roar ; -- the meteor of the ocean air shall sweep the clouds no more . her deck , once red with heroes blood , where knelt the vanquished foe . when winds were hurrying o'er the flood and waves were white below .
clemens left next day for columbia . where the university is located , at each station a crowd had gathered to cheer and wave as the train pulled in and to offer him flowers . sometimes he tried to say a few words , but his voice would not come . this was more than even [male] had dreamed , certainly there is something deeply touching in the recognition of one 's native state . the return of the boy who has set out unknown to battle with life and who is called back to be crowned is unlike any other home coming .
thus they talked ; except the soft lady , who had slipped into a seat by herself with an album over her knees . and with an empty chair on either side of her , there she waited . meantime , down below , the men had shifted into chairs to one end of the table and the heavy host was shoving cigars at them . thick as ropes , and passing the port wine . with his big fist round the neck of the decanter .
when the vittles are put on the table , they are kept warm by electric warmin ', furnaces . when dinner is over the dishes mount upstairs agin . and are washed by a electric automatic dish washer , and dried by a electric dish drier . the ice for dinner is made by a miniature ammonia ice plant . which keeps the hull house cool in hot days and nights .
it was very late when carrie and i got home . but on entering the sitting room i said : `` carrie , what do you think of mr. [male] ? '' she simply answered : `` how like lupin , '' the same idea occurred to me in the train . the comparison kept me awake half the night . mr. [male] was , of course .
this silent declaration of war had evidently had its complete effect . as [male] and [male] walked steadily but slowly towards the entrance [male] of the institution . they could see that most , or at least many , of the patients had already gathered there as well as the staff of doctors and the whole regiment of keepers and assistants . but when they entered the lamp lit [male] , and the high iron door was clashed to and locked behind them . yet a new amazement leapt into their eyes .
[male] , refrain , audacious tar . your suit from pressing , remember what you are , and whom addressing , i would laugh my rank to scorn in union holy . were he more highly born or i more lowly , ralph , proud lady . have your way , unfeeling beauty , you speak and i obey . it is my duty , i am the lowliest tar that sails the water .
i stayed in the brush shop three or four months . but i made very little progress in learning the trade , i was willing enough to learn and did my best . from the day i entered the prison i made up my mind to behave as well as i could . to be docile and obedient , and to comply with every rule and order , consequently i had no trouble . and the officers all treated me kindly , warden robinson was a model man for his position .
well , to return to [location] , [location] is a large dry country bounded on the north by canadian club whisky . on the south by mexican pulque , and on the east and west by salt water . the population consists of one hundred million thirsty souls , some of whom are americans . religious to a fault , and ambidexterously prodigal , they nevertheless show signs of reverting to the condition of the arboreal anthropoids . a race of straphangers is developing , at certain hours of the day .
i wrote in to the house pretty often on that trip , explaining how it was . going over the whole situation very carefully , and telling what our competitors were doing . wherever i could find that they were doing anything . i gave old hammer credit for more curiosity than he possessed . because when i reached [location] i found a telegram from him reading .
we hear much of the human error which accepts what is sham and what is real . but it is worth while to remember that with unfamiliar things we often mistake what is real for what is sham . it is true that a very young man may think the wig of an actress is her hair . but it is equally true that a child yet younger may call the hair of a negro his wig . just because the woolly savage is remote and barbaric he seems to be unnaturally neat and tidy .
nor certainly would she admit to herself that she was in the least afraid of him herself . but for her husband 's foolish jealousy she would infinitely have preferred the arrangement as now made . just as a little girl prefers as a playmate a handsome boy whom she has long known . to some ill visaged stranger with whom she has never quarrelled and never again made friends . but when she saw her husband she found herself unable to tell him of the change which had been made .
but the heart of king [male] sinks before the stern faces of the english fighting men . and the arm of king [male] drops back on to his rein . and he dismounts and takes his seat in the foremost barge . and the barons follow in , with each mailed hand upon the sword hilt , and the word is given to let go . slowly the heavy , bright decked barges leave the shore of runningmede .
she could not stand a third coincidence , and besides . she much doubted whether any gown that had once been of so pronounced a crimson lake . could successfully attempt to appear of any other hue except perhaps black , if diva died . she might perhaps consult miss [female] as to whether black would be possible , but then if diva died . there was no reason for not wearing crimson lake for ever , since it would be an insincerity of which miss [female] humbly hoped she was incapable .
`` you surprise me , '' said mr. [male] . wholly without shame , he bowed , started his horse . and jogged along for five minutes , then he turned to the right upon a crossroad and suddenly found himself upon the hounds . they were feathering excitedly about the mouth of a tile drain into which the fox had evidently gone . no master , huntsmen nor whips were in sight .
but in spite of his determination to unbosom himself without further delay . he knew that a kind of fascinated resignation was growing upon him and gaining firmer hold each minute . something must be done to break the spell and burst the toils which were being woven round him before all effort became impossible . `` and now , '' said the doctor , glancing up at the great clock face on which a reflector cast a patch of dim yellow light . `` we must be thinking of starting , but do not forget what i have said . ''
it is by no means improbable that our readers have a right to an apology at our hands for the habit we have indulged of lingering along with the two individuals whose sayings and doings are not directly essential to our tale . but is not the story of every day life our guarantee that incidents and people cross and re cross the path we are going . attracting our attention , engaging our sympathy , enlisting our energies . even in our most anxious periods ? such is the world ; and we can not venture out of reality . besides this , we are disposed to think that the moral of a tale is often more effectively conveyed by the characters than by the catastrophe of a story .
an hour and a half later they were all safe under the roof of the cabin . they had brought the corpse with them . sir [male] tarried there but a few minutes , and then began the long and troublesome descent from the cabin to chamonix . he probably reached there about two or three o'clock in the morning . after having been afoot among the rocks and glaciers during two days and two nights .
he understood the sex and knew what pleased them . and with the subtle art of a courtier he breathed into their ears a flattery too delicate to be resented . beside such an expert [male] , floundering in his first real love affair . felt but a blunderer , perhaps mr. [male] realized this and rather enjoyed the amateur 's chagrin . however that may have been , he certainly let no opportunity slip for the display of his proficiency .
n.b. -- mr broughton proposes , with proper assistance . to open an academy at his house in the haymarket . for the instruction of those who are willing to be initiated in the mystery of boxing . where the whole theory and practice of that truly british art . with all the various stops , blows , cross buttocks , and [male] .
they looked at one another , if ever astonishment was expressed in the attitude of a bird it was told by the tails of those two sparrows . they whispered wickedly together , the idea occurred to them that by force or cunning they might perhaps obtain possession of one of the other nests . but all the other nests were occupied , and even gentle [female] swallow . once in her own home with the children round about her , is not to be trifled with . mr. [male] called at number two .
the woman looked toward the tramp , she evidently decided in his favor . let him set on the step and i kin hand him out some coffee and some meat . if that will do him , she said , and [male] seated himself . the breakfast she brought him on a chipped plate was all he could have desired . there was a half of a veal cutlet , browned to a nicety .
at his restaurant he had cut a potato in two and sent half of it to the head waiter to know if it was bermudian . it had all the look of an early bermudian . but the duke feared from the shading of it that it might be only a late trinidad . and the head waiter sent it to the chef . mistaking it for a complaint , and the chef sent it back to the duke with a message that it was not a bermudian but a prince [male] island .
the rows of corn , in the field where squinty the comical pig was lost . were like the streets of a city , they were very straight and even . just like the street where your house is , and , if you liked . you could pretend that each hill of corn was a house . `` oh dear , '' squinty grunted , in his funny , squealing voice .
you remember how the papers used to say if we ever drove the fritzes back to [location] we could never get across the border . proper gander , every word of it . they didnt even have a fence around it . we just crossed a little river no wider than silver creek an there we was . no screamin wimmin , no stray shots out of attiks , no awtrocities .
i should have liked to sit where i was all night . it was at least warm and sheltered , and i have slept on worse beds than may be made of half a dozen cathedral chairs . but presently the verger came round , and perceiving at a glance that i was not a person likely to possess a superfluous sixpence . asked me if i was going to sit there all night . i said i was if he did not mind .
etc. , and sing them to sleep with sweet , plaintive voices . and then kiss them good night , and kneel down by the bedside and weep . but it was different with this fellow , he was named jim . and there was not anything the matter with his mother . no consumption , nor anything of that kind .
my dear egbert , -- your mother informs me that tomorrow . the 7th inst. , is your fifteenth birthday , i therefore take this opportunity of combining my customary greetings with a few observations on your half term report . which has just reached me , it is a most deplorable document . with the exception of your health ( which is described as `` excellent '' ) , and your violin playing ( which i note is `` most energetic '' ) , i can find no cause for congratulation or even satisfaction in your record for the past half term .
although i try with all my might , i never seem to strike it right . now i admit it seems to me they show great inconsistency . but they imply i am to blame ; of course that makes my anger flame . and in a fiery fit of pique i stay at ninety for a week . or sometimes in a dull despair , i give them just a frigid stare .
a cable had been previously laid from port [female] to java and thence to [location] . and there was telegraphic communication with england from [location] . and so , if adelaide could make connection with port [female] it meant connection with the whole world . the enterprise succeeded , one could watch the [location] markets daily , now . the profit to the wool growers of [location] was instant and enormous .
having concocted this choice morsel of bait . they set it in the great stream of newspapers . there to catch fish , in plain terms . with some cash and some credit -- for their means would not even reach to pay in advance the whole of their first advertising bill . they managed to have their advertisement published during several weeks in a carefully chosen group of about thirty of the principal newspapers of [location] .
he was bent on putting america at ease . and he had the right art ; one could not remain doubtful and timorous where a person was so earnest and simple and gentle . and talked so alluringly as he did ; no , he won america over , and it was not long before we were content and comfortable and chatty . and glad we had found this new friend . when the feeling of constraint was all gone we asked him how he had learned to do that strange thing .
the grand schemes for a marble facade were never carried out , and it is brown unfinished stone until this day . but for the inside [male] was summoned to decorate the walls of the nave . [male] came -- that is to say , he did not come , german research having decisively proved . but at all events the nave is covered with frescoes . and so are two chapels in the left transept .
honour 's orders were , not to suffer her mistress to come out of her room without the authority of the squire himself . and to admit none to her but him and her aunt . but she was herself to attend her with whatever sophia pleased . except only pen , ink , and paper , of which she was forbidden the use . the squire ordered his daughter to dress herself and attend him at dinner .
who would mind roughing it a bit if that were all it meant ? what cared robinson crusoe for a patch on his trousers ? did he wear trousers ? i forget ; or did he go about as he does in the pantomimes ? what did it matter to him if his toes did stick out of his boots ? and what if his umbrella was a cotton one , so long as it kept the rain off ?
years afterward i heard that the household of the dacres was among the happiest in the whole country . and that no cloud had ever come again to darken their lives , yet i dare say if he could have seen into his wife 's mind . but there , i say no more , a lady 's secret is her own . and i fear that she and it are buried long years ago in some devonshire churchyard . perhaps all that gay circle are gone and the lady [male] only lives now in the memory of an old half pay french brigadier .
this occurred to mr pickering after he had been round the place three times . and he ceased to grope for a switch and began to seek for a match box . he was still seeking it when he was frozen in his tracks by the sound of footsteps . muffled but by their nearness audible , just outside the door , he pulled out his pistol . which he had replaced in his pocket , backed against the wall .
here we have a man with a quiet , gentlemanly way . and yet withal a cool , level head , a man who knows when he needs more room and how best to go to work to remedy that defect . mr. [male] sees that another row of sleeping rooms . cut low in the ceiling , is actually needed , in fancy he already sees these rooms added to his house . each has a strip of hemp carpet in front of the bed and a cute little green shade over the window .
`` i think i would rather not to night , i do not know that i am quite strong enough . '' then he did not say another word to press her . only begging that she would not go to the dinner either if she were not well . but she was quite well , and she did go to the dinner . again she had meant to tell him why she would not go to mrs. [female] 's ball .
on the 1st of november it became absolutely necessary to halt for a day or two . as soon as the place for the encampment had been selected , they proceeded to arrange it . it was determined to erect a house of snow . which should be supported against one of the rocks of the promontory , person at once marked out the foundations . which measured fifteen feet long by five wide , penellan , aupic , and person .
the common people , they know me and they love me . the tailor -- i have come a far journey to see your majesty . the tailor -- for a long time i have been journeying to find an enlightened sovereign . a sovereign who was fitted in all respects for his high office . i stopped in ruritania ; he was not there .
the knock was repeated , it was louder than before , and more impatient , `` it 's morris , '' cried [female] , in a startled voice , and she ran to the door and opened it . it was indeed morris that stood before them ; not the morris of ordinary days . but a wild looking fellow , pale and haggard . with bloodshot eyes , and a two days beard upon his chin .
we took the sculls and tried to push the boat off the mud . and , in doing so , we broke one of the sculls , after that we proceeded with great caution . but they were a wretched old pair , and the second one cracked almost easier than the first . and left [location] helpless , the mud stretched out for about a hundred yards in front of us . and behind [location] was the water , the only thing to be done was to sit and wait until someone came by .
one can only gather that there lurks in the supposedly innocuous amber of ginger ale an elevating something which the temperance reformers have overlooked . wilberforce bray had , if you remember . tucked away no fewer than three in the spot where they would do most good . one presumes that the child , with all that stuff surging about inside him . had become thoroughly above himself , he uttered a merry laugh .
that morning the manager at the yard received a deputation from the men . headed by mr. [male] , who , although he had changed his clothes and taken a hot bath . was still conscious of the disgusting reek of rotten eggs , before dinner time the whole matter had been settled . and the men were to resume work at two o'clock . [male] reached home a few minutes to one .
these people insult thermometers and their guests further by placing one of the former in the bathroom soap dish . in order that the latter may discover whether it is a hot or cold bath which they are having . all decent people know that a hot bath is one which you can just bear to get into . and that a cold bath is one which you can not bear to think of getting into . but have to for honour 's sake , they do riot want to be told how many degrees fahrenheit it is .
never did poor prisoner long for deliverance , more than i have longed for an opportunity to disburthen my cares into your friendly bosom . and the occasion which now presents itself , is little less than miraculous -- honest saunders macawly . the travelling scotchman , who goes every year to wales . is now at glasgow , buying goods , and coming to pay his respects to our family . has undertaken to deliver this letter into your own hand -- we have been six weeks in [location] .
there was something sad in this , even to [female] , she knew that she was taking her husband away from the life he liked . and that she , herself , was going to a life as to which she could not even guess . whether she would like it or not , but she had the satisfaction of feeling that she was at last going to begin to live as a married woman . hitherto she had been treated as a child , if there was danger . there was , at any rate , the excitement which danger produces .
she was not quite what you would call refined , she was not quite what you would call unrefined . she was the kind of person that keeps a parrot . pudd'nhead [male] 's new calendar , so far as i am able to judge , nothing has been left undone . either by man or nature , to make [location] the most extraordinary country that the sun visits on his round . nothing seems to have been forgotten , nothing over looked , always , when you think you have come to the end of her tremendous specialties and have finished hanging tags upon her as the land of the thug .
they seem to know the volume by heart . and to revere it as they would a bible -- another bible , perhaps i ought to say . plainly the book was written under the mental desolations of the third degree . and i feel sure that none but the membership of that degree can discover meanings in it . when you read it you seem to be listening to a lively and aggressive and oracular speech delivered in an unknown tongue .
he replied that he would cheerfully obey her majesty 's command . the messenger retired , and left the family in great perturbation . `` alas , '' said dame [female] . what if the queen knows that i have brought up this girl as a catholic . and thence infers that we are all of [location] christians in this house !
after lunch , [female] , who lives three houses down the street . will come up and ask if she may bring her cousin to play a set until someone wants the court . [location] 's cousin has never played tennis before but she has done a lot of croquet and thinks she ought to pick tennis up rather easily . for three hours there is a great deal of screaming , with [location] and her cousin hitting the ball an aggregate of eleven times . while daddy patters up and down the side lines .
he is freed from the curse of hearing her sighs and complaints to have a child . for she 's no sooner within the dores . but she talks of her neighbours child . and wishes with the loss of all that shes worth in the world that she had such a one too . which continues alwaies so long , that finally she bursts out into the like former frenzy against her husband .
betrayed by his friends , stricken , disconsolate , in a panic of despair . he had yet seemed glad to hear that he had been `` funny . '' he flew to the sanctity of his room . not again could he bear to be told that the acting which had been his soul 's high vision was a thing for merriment . he paced his room a long time .
the weather is cool in summer , and the walks and drives are all pleasant and none of them fatiguing . when you start out to `` do '' the falls you first drive down about a mile . and pay a small sum for the privilege of looking down from a precipice into the narrowest part of the niagara river . a railway `` cut '' through a hill would be as comely if it had the angry river tumbling and foaming through its bottom . you can descend a staircase here a hundred and fifty feet down .
his advance was unresisted , gerande , aubert , and scholastique closely followed him . master zacharius , as if guided by an irresistible hand . seemed sure of his way , and strode along with rapid step . he reached an old worm eaten door , which fell before his blows . whilst the bats described oblique circles around his head .
the old proverb saith , it must bend well . before it can make a good hook , but it is easie to be perceived by the beginning . what may be expected from the flexibility of this precious twig , o extraordinary and magnificent pleasure for the parents . when they see that their son , in so short a time . is so damnably advanced , and so much the more , a little while after .
everybody had vociferously applauded , while reporters turned rapidly the pages of their note books , `` ass ! '' [male] had said to himself with much force and sincerity . meaning sir [male] -- but he too had vociferously applauded ; for he was from the five towns . and in the five towns people are like that , then sir [male] had declared the corner stone well and truly laid ( it was on the corner which the electric sign of the future was destined to occupy ) . and after being thanked had wandered off , shaking hands here and there absently , to arrive at length in the office of the clerk of the works .
it is naturally a fine thing for one , and gratifying . to acquire a thorough art education , personally i do not in the least regret the time i gave and the study i devoted to acquiring mine . i regard those two weeks as having been well spent , i shall not do it soon again . however , for now i know all about art , let others who have not enjoyed my advantages take up this study . let others scour the art galleries of [location] seeking masterpieces .
of the details of that conflict we have no very clear record . phipps is enthusiastic , but vague , he speaks in eulogistic terms of a `` corker '' which spencer brought off in the second round . and , again , of a `` tremendous biff '' which [male] appears to have consummated in the fourth . but of the more subtle points of the fighting he is content merely to state comprehensively that they were `` top hole . '' as to the result , it would seem that , in the capacity of referee .
[female] soon developed into something more than a cow . when other occupations failed , the campers would collect round [female] . examining her from every angle , she was a mystery . just as a juggler or the three card trick were mysteries . and as such she commanded respect , each night and morning the bishop had to produce from somewhere a person capable of ministering to the requirements of [female] .
not long did he linger before on the finger of lucie he fitted a ring . a month or two later they made him dictator . in place of the elderly king : he was lauded by pulpit . and boomed by press , and no one had ever a chance to guess . beholding this hero who ruled like a [male] , his valor was zero .
it was at this point that she translated hamlet into every day speech . assuring her lover that there was many a true , mysterious thing in this world . if he was skeptical , let him have patience . one thing , however , was certain : the card reader had guessed everything . what more could he desire ? the best proof was that at this moment she was at ease and content .
on the days she went to mass . which as we have said was before daylight , her parents attended at church and talked with their daughter in presence of her husband . who made them such liberal gifts as mitigated the keenness of their compassion for the secluded life led by their daughter . carrizales used to get up in the morning and watch for the arrival of the purveyor . who was always made aware of what was wanted for the day by means of a note placed over night in the turning box .
we proceeded about twenty miles beyond inverary . to the house of a gentleman , a friend of our conductor . where we stayed a few days , and were feasted in such a manner . that i began to dread the consequence to my constitution . it can not be expected , that the gentlemen of this country should execute commercial schemes to render their vassals independent .
bindle complied , producing the presentation watch and chain . a gold scarf pin , a pair of gold sleeve links . one diamond and three gold studs . and a diamond ring , he omitted to include the professor 's loose change . which he had picked up from the small table by the bedside .
captain [male] had taken it and concealed it in a hollow tree . since called the charter oak , after andros was ejected from the [location] office . the charter was brought out again , and business under it was resumed . [male] now settled at providence plantation . where he was joined by mrs. [female] .
mr. [male] always spoke the truth when he could . he spoke it now , it seemed to roland . as the days went by , that nothing could mar the pleasant . easy course of life at the windlebirds . the fine weather , the beautiful garden , the pleasant company .
the arms now took the head from the legs and put the legs on the body where they belonged . then the right arm stuck the left arm in its place . after which the left arm picked up the right arm and placed it also where it belonged . then all that remained was for the prince to place his head on his shoulders . and there he was -- as good as new , he picked up his sword .
but bishop was not sick , i searched the boat from the back to the stern and he was not aboard . i guess probably he found out some way that they was such an institution as the pere marquette . which gets into [location] without touchin them perilous copper ranges . but whether he arrived safe or not i do not know , because i have never saw him from that day to this . and i have lived happy ever afterward , and my investment , amountin all told to just about what he owes me .
she immediately got her bonnet and went off to the telegraph office . leaving word with the servant , that if any one called `` he '' was to be told that she had received sudden tidings which took her up to [location] . on her return she found that `` he '' had not been there yet . and now she could only hope that he would not come till after she had started . it would , of course , be impossible , at such a moment as this .
and so i had swathed myself in wrappings until i could scarcely clamber into the panting little car . and we had darted off along the smooth lake drives . while the wind whipped the scarlet into our cheeks . even while it brought the tears to our eyes . there was no chance for conversation , even if [male] gerhard had been in talkative mood .
very soon piutes began to go to the shack to spend the heated term , every piute who took the appeal saw the advertisement . which went on to state that hot and cold water could be got into every room in the house . and that electric bells , baths , silver voiced chambermaids . over charges , and everything else connected with a first class hotel . could be found at that place , so the piute people locked up their own homes .
i should like to pretend that i myself have grown out of these snobbish ways by this time . but i am doubtful if it would be true , it happened to me not so long ago to be travelling in company of which i was very much ashamed . and to be ashamed of one 's company is to be a snob , at this period i was trying to amuse myself ( and , if it might be so . other people ) by writing a burlesque story in the manner of an imaginary collaboration by sir [male] caine and mrs. [female] . in order to do this i had to study the works of these famous authors .
during our scientific explorations in the eastern hemisphere , we met two guides who had served the late [female] . one who had served the late [female] pierpont [female] . and one who had acted as courier to ex president theodore [female] . after inquiry among persons who were also lately abroad , i have come to the conclusion that my experience in this regard was remarkable . not because i met so many as four of the guides who had attended these distinguished americans .
i feel i resemble that young lady , not so much in charm and beauty as in indecision of mind . when the question is that of my favourite author or my favourite book . it is as if one were asked one 's favourite food , there are times when one fancies an egg with one 's tea . on other occasions one dreams of a kipper . today one clamours for lobsters .
a snore sounded from the pillows , punctuating the recital like a mark of exclamation . ashe laid down the book and peered into the darkness beyond the rays of the bed lamp . his employer slept , ashe switched off the light and crept to the door . out in the passage he stopped and listened , all was still , he stole downstairs . [male] sat in his bedroom in the bachelors
as i had imagined , this broad boulevard led out into the central square . which was full of troops and blazing with fires , i walked swiftly onward . disregarding one or two people who addressed remarks to me . i passed the cathedral and followed the street which had been described to me . being upon the side of the city which was farthest from our attack .
however , these were small matters , no doubt the dear girl had been in a hurry and so forth . the important point was that he was going to see her . when a man 's afraid , sings the bard , a beautiful maid is a cheering sight to see . and the same truth holds good when a man has made an exhibition of himself at a ship 's concert . a woman 's gentle sympathy , that was what [female] wanted more than anything else at the moment .
and then after resting for an hour , you go for a walk up the mountains . or if you are too weak to walk , you can get a cart and a donkey . the driver walking alongside ; up the shady paths you will go . resting anon or oftener at some pleasant summer house or cafay . at one you have your dinner , you can get it anywhere along your way or go back to your tarven for it .
we boys wanted to go and see marget and show friendliness for her . but our parents were afraid of offending the community and would not let us . the astrologer was going around inflaming everybody against father [male] . and saying he was an abandoned thief and had stolen eleven hundred and seven gold ducats from him . he said he knew he was a thief from that fact .
the door closed behind mr. [male] . lord [male] was alone , for some moments he stood where he had been left . a figure with small signs of alertness about it . but mr. [male] did not return immediately , the booming of his voice came faintly from some distant region . lord [male] strolled to the window and looked out .
when the proper time arrives , he fetches him out and hands him over to the guard of the train . who is only a policeman in another uniform , the guard tells him where to sit in the train . and when to get out , and sees that he does get out , in [location] you take no responsibility upon yourself whatever . everything is done for you , and done well , you are not supposed to look after yourself . you are not blamed for being incapable of looking after yourself ; it is the duty of the german policeman to look after you .
he stopped and listened , no sound of horse 's hoof broke the silence . he walked on again , then , faint at first , but growing stronger every instant . there came from some point in the road far behind him a steady droning sound . he almost shouted with joy , a motor ! even now he might do it , but could he stop it ?
so sheen shut himself up in his study and ground grimly away at his books . and for exercise went for cross-country walks . it was a monotonous kind of existence . for the space of a week the only wrykinian who spoke a single word to him was bruce . the son of the conservative candidate for wrykyn .
bill , meanwhile , [male] following close behind him . was ploughing his way onward , from time to time he would turn to administer some encouraging remark . for it had come home to him by now that encouraging remarks were what she needed very much in the present crisis of her affairs . she was showing him a new and hitherto unsuspected side of her character . the [male] whom he had known -- the valiant , self reliant [female] .
as far as [male] could judge -- he was not in a condition to make nice calculations . he had about four seconds in which to get busy with that bell rope . probably nobody has ever crammed more energetic work into four seconds than he did then . the night was as still as only an english summer night can be . and the first clang of the clapper sounded like a million iron girders falling from a height on to a sheet of tin .
there is also glencore 's boy , -- a strange , dreamy kind of haughty fellow . an exaggeration of his father in disposition . but with good abilities , these are not the elements of much social agreeability . but you know , dear friend , how little i stand in need of what is called company . your last letter , charming as it was , has afforded me all the companionship i could desire .
why , take the missionary operations , the woman 's missionary society is today raising more money and doing more missionary work than the parent missionary society did fifty years ago . and yet men legislate concerning the missionary operations of women . and give them no voice directly in this body . mr. president , while the last speaker was on the floor . a modification of a passage of scripture occurred to me .
and probably a wagon , i was mistaken ; i have not seen a proper duststorm . to my mind the exterior aspects and character of [location] are fascinating things to look at and think about . they are so strange , so weird , so new , so uncommonplace , such a startling and interesting contrast to the other sections of the planet . the sections that are known to [location] all , familiar to [location] all . in the matter of particulars -- a detail here .
in the present case , the serpent was a volatile young gentleman of the name of charteris . this indomitable person had the love of the stage ineradicably implanted in him . he wrote plays , and lived in hopes of seeing them staged at the leading theatres . meanwhile , he was content to bring them out through the medium of amateur performances . it says much for the basic excellence of this man 's character that he was popular among his fellows .
i adopted the plan , i could not see them very clearly . i aimed rather at the noise ; and i had thrown about twenty choice lumps without effect . and was feeling somewhat discouraged , when a yell , followed by language singularly unappropriate to the season . told me that providence had aided my arm . the music ceased suddenly , and the party dispersed , apparently in high glee .
he tore off the leaf and put the rest of the book in its secret hiding place . then , folding the paper double , he placed it on the top of his stool . lighted a match and set fire to it . it made a horrid smudge for so small a paper . and the king sat on the edge of the bed and watched it eagerly .
at the south at this time coffee was fifty dollar a pound and gloves were one hundred and fifty dollar a pair . flour was forty dollar a barrel . but you could get a barrel of currency for less than that . money was plenty , but what was needed seemed to be confidence , running the blockade was not profitable at that time . since over fifteen hundred head of confederate vessels were captured during the war .
toto , struck momentarily dumb by the sight of food . had jumped off the bed and was standing with his head on one side . peering questioningly at the cracker , he was a suspicious dog . but he allowed himself to be lured into the passage . upon which sally threw the cracker down and slipped in and shut the door , toto , after a couple of yaps .
she nodded gravely and put both her hands in his , i know , ', she said . i know you are my friend . my best friend , then she ran into the house and he watched there until the gas went on . for the next week [male] was in a nervous turmoil . some persistently rational strain warned him that at bottom he and marjorie had little in common .
the travelers , indeed , needed not to look to the right or the left . for the path of the iron rails led them directly on . they did not step to the gallery , did not knock at the door . or , indeed , give any evidences of their intentions , but seated themselves deliberately upon a pile of boards that lay near in the broad expanse of the front yard . here they remained , silent and at rest , fitting well enough into the sleepy scene .
presently the minion who had been despatched to the upper regions with fenn 's message returned . would he go upstairs , third door on the left . fenn followed the instructions , and found himself in a small room . a third of which was filled by a huge iron bound chest . another third by a very stout man and a dressing table , while the rest of the space was comparatively empty .
she meant neutral , of course , the neighbor admired . and smiled , while ike lay on the floor , with his legs in the air . trying to balance mrs. [female] 's fancy waiter on his toe . christmas ike was made the happy possessor of a fiddle . which he found in the morning near his stocking .
`` sartain , sartain , '' answered poor [female] , tremulously . it was already late , and when the grand jury had formally dismissed the complaint against jim . the hour was so advanced that adjournment was taken for the day . when mr. [male] left the court house no one spoke to him . and he walked slowly home , full of the worst forebodings .
verily there seems to be some foundation to the belief that devotion to the life of a seaman makes a man callous to assaults on his personal reputation ! the recent visit of king [male] to our wild districts in search of a fresh hunting ground for himself and his son . prince [male] , brought about a very serious condition of affairs in respect to the mastodon . or what some persons refer to as the antediluvians , this most distinguished personage . wearying of the affairs of state in his own land .
if the hand , the arm , the brain . the tongue , or any other member , is fatigued with inanition . it is not to be rested by addeding a day 's inanition . but if a member is fatigued with exertion , inanition is the right rest for it . such is the way in which the germans seem to define the word `` rest '' .
may 22 , last night wind headed [location] off . so that part of the time we had to steer east south east and then west north west . and so on , this morning we were all startled by a cry of `` sail ho ! '' sure enough , we could see it , and for a time we cut adrift from the second mate 's boat . and steered so as to attract its attention , this was about half past five a.m. after sailing in a state of high excitement for almost twenty minutes we made it out to be the chief mate 's boat .
nonsense ; you were asked for a five months ', cruise . besides , think of getting home in the middle of august . with every one away , it would be like going to philadelphia , brave as he was in the presence of his friends . in the privacy of his stateroom [male] gave way to the depression that was bearing down upon him . it was the hardest task of his life to go on with his scheme in the face of opposition .
the next morning , at what seemed a very early hour , the little white table waiter appeared suddenly in my room and shot a single word out of himself `` breakfast ! '' this was a remarkable boy in many ways , he was about eleven years old . he had alert , intent black eyes . he was quick of movement ; there was no hesitation . no uncertainty about him anywhere ; there was a military decision in his lip .
now , what could be fairer than that , [ to helen. ] do you agree to this ? i know it , i want to do right , theodore , please believe that i do ! but the kind of marriage preached by the church and practised by the world . does that cherish the real sacredness of this relationship ? of course . i can only judge from appearances , but so often marriage seems to destroy the sacredness .
that 's all right in theory , but this is a practical world . my pull got you into the institute . my pull can get you out , you give up this wild idea or give up your job ! what did i tell you ? financial force ! they still try it , you see .
some days ago the official council of the independent labour party . or [organization] of the official labour party . or the independent and official council of the labour party ( i have got quite nervous about these names and distinctions . but they all seem to say the same thing ) began their manifesto by saying it would be difficult to assign the degrees of responsibility which each nation had for the outbreak of the war . afterwards , a writer in the `` christian commonwealth , ''
`` well , i must be toddling on , '' he said , after identifying georgie 's box of cigarettes . and being rather puzzled by a bulge in georgie 's pocket . `` you will be looking in some time this morning , perhaps . '' georgie had not been quite sure that he would ( for he was very busy owing to the arrival of his sisters . and the necessity of going to mr holroyd 's , in order that that artist might accurately match the shade of his hair with a view to the expensive toupet ) .
besides , thirty hours journey out and thirty hours journey back . would only leave about sixty hours there , no good , rome , seville , constantinople , [location] , still farther . should have to leave on the return journey before i arrived . where can i go to at easter to be warm and comfortable , without so much trouble , i know , to bed !
his own glazed eyes , becoming slightly crossed with an ennui that was peculiarly intense this morning . rendered the eye more monstrous than it was , it expanded to horrible size , growing mountainous . it turned into a volcano in the tropics . and yet it stared at him , indubitably an eye implacably hostile to all rights of privacy forever . penrod blinked and clinched his eyelids to be rid of this dual image .
it might not have been easy to decide in respect of which of their manifold properties . jonas , mr pecksniff . the carpet bag , and the portmanteau , could be likened to a clap of thunder . but mr jonas giving his assent to this proposal . they stole round into the back yard .
the door from the pantry to the kitchen was partly open . however , and mr. [male] could not avoid hearing everything that passed there . although every fresh word added to his uneasiness , until at last he would have given worlds to escape from his involuntary position of eavesdropper . there were only two persons just then in the kitchen : his cook . who , still in her working dress , was refreshing herself after her labours over the supper with a journal of some sort .
i grab a sweater and gloves and money and get out before they can start anymore questions . on the subway i start wondering if [female] will show up , it 's almost two months since we made this sort of crazy date . and the weather sure is not helping any , coney island is made to be crowded and noisy . all the billboards scream at you . as if they had to get your attention , so when the place is empty .
other times i lay on the floor in the mistress 's work room and slept . she gently using me for a foot stool , knowing it pleased me . for it was a caress ; other times i spent an hour in the nursery . and got well tousled and made happy ; other times i watched by the crib there . when the baby was asleep and the nurse out for a few minutes on the baby 's affairs .
`` hardly safe to reckon on that , '' i suggest ; and he agrees with me . and proceeds to look for some more fitable trains , b . 's intellect generally gives way about this point . and he becomes simply drivelling , he discovers trains that run from munich to heidelberg in fourteen minutes . by way of [location] and geneva . with half an hour 's interval for breakfast at rome .
[female] had to ask her to repeat her remark . he could not believe his luck , it is singular how diffident a normally self confident man can become . once he is in love , when colonel milvery . of the [male] , had informed him of his promotion to the post of second gardener . [male] had demanded no encore , he knew his worth .
geo , i know it . will , and it is awful ; but i can not live without seeing [female] . i have endured it as long as i can . i should die if i tried to hold out longer -- and even german is preferable to death . [female] well , i do not know ; it 's a matter of opinion , geo .
chess has this in common with making poetry , that the desire for it comes upon the amateur in gusts . it is very easy for him not to make poetry . sometimes he may go for months without writing a line of it . but when once he is delivered of an ode , then the desire to write another ode is strong upon him . a sudden passion for rhyme masters him .
the point is not whether we regard his defence of the government at the old bailey as a chivalrous and reluctant duty done as an advocate or a friend . or as a mere case of a lawyer selling his soul for a fat brief . the point is that whichever of the two actions we approve . and whichever of the four explanations we adopt . sir [male] 's position is still raving nonsense .
some of the dailies move too fast , others too slowly , for instance . my heidelberg daily was always twenty-four hours old when it arrived at the hotel . but one of my munich evening papers used to come a full twenty-four hours before it was due . some of the less important dailies give one a tablespoonful of a continued story every day . it is strung across the bottom of the page .
he returned to the office of works which commanded a view of the whole length of the east corridor . he was careful to leave the door ajar so that he had an uninterrupted view . he sat down and proceeded to enjoy the morning paper which the `` boots '' had brought him . the second bottle of the foreman 's beer . and the remains of the bread and cheese .
today by scores of women it was calculated not only that the velvet of the duke 's mantle could not have cost less than four guineas a yard . but also that there must be quite twenty five yards of it , some of the fair mathematicians had . in the course of the past fortnight , visited the royal academy and seen there mr. [male] 's portrait of the wearer . so that their estimate now was but the endorsement of an estimate already made . yet their impression of the duke was above all a spiritual one .
the amount or strength of man 's brains have little to do with the amount of their superstitions . the most learned and the greatest men have been the deepest believers in ingeniously contrived machines for running human reason off the track . if any expositions i can make on this subject will serve to put people on their guard against impositions of all sorts . as well as foolish superstitions , i shall feel a pleasure in reflecting that i have not written in vain . the heading of this chapter enumerates the principal kinds of supernatural humbugs .
raspberries are a good fruit gone wrong , a raspberry by itself might indeed be the best fruit of all . but it is almost impossible to find it alone , i do not refer to its attachment to the red currant . rather to the attachment to it of so many of our dumb little friends . the instinct of the lower creatures for the best is well shown in the case of the raspberry . if it is to be eaten it must be picked by the hand .
he that waits upon fortune is never sure of a dinner . in the evening i felt a mighty inclination to go to a party somewhere . there was to be one at governor [male] 's , and i went there and asked permission to stand around a while . this was granted in the most hospitable manner , and the vision of plain quadrilles soothed my weary soul . i felt particularly comfortable , for if there is one thing more grateful to my feelings than another .
it was good paste , if you merely desired to disfigure a piano or a wife . but otherwise it would not stick at all , i did not like it . i was mad about it , but my wife seemed quite stuck on it . she has not got it all out of her hair yet . i did send a man over the lots .
swearing relieves the feelings -- that is what swearing does , i explained this to my aunt on one occasion . but it did not answer with her , she said i had no business to have such feelings . that is what i told tittums , i told her she ought to be ashamed of herself . brought up in at christian family as she was , too , i do not so much mind hearing an old cat swear . but i can not bear to see a mere kitten give way to it .
about a month after the loss of the `` independence , '' i happened to meet [male] hardy in broadway . our conversation turned , naturally , upon the disaster , and especially upon the sad fate of poor wyatt . i thus learned the following particulars , the artist had engaged passage for himself . wife , two sisters and a servant .
his habits were as regular as his person , he daily took his four stated meals . appropriating exactly an hour to each ; he smoked and doubted eight hours . and he slept the remaining twelve of the four and twenty , such was the renowned wouter [male] . a true philosopher , for his mind was either elevated above , or tranquilly settled below . the cares and perplexities of this world .
perhaps it was this conservatism on my part that caused my advice to be sought after by the inner circle . what you might term the governing body of the anarchists . for , strange as it may appear , this organisation , sworn to put down all law and order . was itself most rigidly governed , with a russian prince elected as its chairman . a man of striking ability , who , nevertheless , i believe , owed his election more to the fact that he was a nobleman than to the recognition of his intrinsic worth .
if he does not seem likely to die they murder him . he is a most unfortunate old gentleman , anything he is mixed up in seems bound to go wrong . if he is manager or director of a bank . smash it goes before even one act is over , his particular firm is always on the verge of bankruptcy . we have only to be told that he has put all his savings into a company .
miss pecksniff signified that he contemplated the introduction of a princely ma . and repeated the sentiment that she was not blind , and was not quite a fool . and would not bear it , mrs todgers was more shocked by the intelligence than any one could have expected . she was quite bitter , she said there was no truth in man and that the warmer he expressed himself . as a general principle , the falser and more treacherous he was .
that was one of the most extraordinary coincidences which ever happened to me , three years after meeting the wife . over the same journey , at the same time of the year . i meet the husband ; and i had never been the journey in the meantime . i did not make my appearance in [location] with merely the proverbial half crown in my pocket . nor was i breathlessly expectant to find the streets paved with gold , thanks chiefly to my savings in [location] .
the house in fifth avenue went to a sister . together with a million or two , and the residue of the estate found kindly disposed relatives who were willing to keep it from going to the home for friendless fortunes . old mr. [male] left his affairs in order . the will nominated [male] buskirk as executor . and he was instructed , in conclusion , to turn over to montgomery [male] .
mr , [male] 's mind was in a whirl . his case was complete , [male] 's appearance in gym shoes . with the explanation that he had lost a shoe . completed the chain , as [location] must have felt when his ship ran into harbor . and the first [location] interviewer , jumping on board .
but he made such poor headway that my patience could not contain me . and i told him i was sufficiently rested and would continue . with alacrity he scrambled out of the hole . and , taking a cigar from my case , seated himself comfortably in the hack . i took my comfort in anticipating the thrill that would be mine when the spade would ring on the ironbound chest .
before we attend him to this intended interview with the lady . we think proper to account for both the preceding notes . as the reader may possibly be not a little surprized at the imprudence of lady [female] . in bringing her lover to the very house where her rival was lodged . first , then , the mistress of the house where these lovers had hitherto met .
the man dressed in black and violet turned round . he had a good and mild countenance , without expression . a mathematician minus the pride , a certain fire sparkled in the eyes of this personage . a rather sly smile played round his lips ; but the observer might soon have remarked that this fire and this smile applied to nothing , enlightened nothing . vatel laughed like an absent man , and amused himself like a child .
perhaps it did savour a little too much of ballet practice . perhaps it was true that with less care there might have been inconveniences . faster it grew and faster ; but still they had all done it before . and done it with absolute accuracy , it was now near the end . each lady had waltzed a turn with each gentleman .
mosquitoes do not meddle with woe so sacred as this ; but at [location] . for example , which has no campo santo . they are having what is known in the [location] language as a high old time . along the riviera the shutters of the hotels are taken down in the first week of october . then arrives the proprietor with the advance guard of servants .
he married his own cousin , [male] , who made a first rate queen . she got so that it was no trouble at all for her to reign while [female] was away attending to his large slaughtering interests . [female] at this time was made lord high constable and keeper of the pound . he was also justiciary of north wales , seneschal of the duchy of lancaster . and chief of police on the north side .
sir , i looked , mrs. pringle gave a shriek . and well may she have , my boy was pointing to a cover on which was what is called . in barroom parlance -- a `` nude . '' and not one nude but twelve , sir , you have destroyed the parental labors of fourteen years . i trust you are satisfied , yours , etc. , [male] .
not dreaming of malice , one year in his palace he led a luxurious life . till his genius dread put it into his head that he needed a beautiful wife . responding to friction , the lamp this affliction at once for aladdin secured . the latter , delighted , imagined he sighted a future of quiet assured . when gladly he chose her , he did not suppose her a philatelist .
the face of the great detective showed the most profound sympathy . it ran up and down in furrows , `` so , '' he muttered . `` the sister of the archbishop , the countess of dashleigh ! '' accustomed as he was to the life of the aristocracy . even the great detective felt that there was here intrigue of more than customary complexity .
it was a troublesome place to get down to , and not a quiet place when you arrived . but it was interesting , there was a world of activity and turmoil and noise . partly religious , partly commercial ; for the mohammedans were there to curse and sell . and the hindoos to buy and pray , it is a fair as well as a religious festival . crowds were bathing , praying , and drinking the purifying waters .
there was an instant hush , followed by the scribbling of pencils . as each person present reduced the sum to its equivalent in his own currency . pounds for the english , francs for the french , marks for the german . and so on , the aggressive tone and the clear cut face of the bidder proclaimed him an american . not less than the financial denomination he had used , in a moment it was realised that his bid was a clear leap of more than two million francs .
in face of this sentiment the administration find it politic to propitiate the local authorities and the people . who , if they were aroused to a feeling of honest indignation at what daily passes beneath their notice . might sweep the pestilence out of their midst , accordingly , whilst keeping the gaming rooms closed against natives resident in the department . the administration throw open all the other pleasures of monte person . inviting the people of person to stroll in their beautiful gardens .
lest the hands should be recognized as belonging to the mediums . they are kept in a constant shaking motion while in view . and to make the hands look large or small , they spread or press together the fingers . with that peculiar rapid motion imparted to them , four hands in the aperture will appear to be half a dozen . a lady 's flesh colored kid glove .
the girls had found out that she was the designer of her own gowns . she had no idle moments after that , and wanted none . for the exercise of an extraordinary gift is the supremest pleasure in life . and it was manifest that sally sellers possessed a gift of that sort in the matter of costume designing . within three days after reaching home she had hunted up some work .
we do not want him to get clawed by going forward in foolishly overconfident forays . there is the tammany tiger , for instance , here and there a brave young fellow rises up and says . `` i am going to kill the tiger , '' having read the fairy stories . he thinks that the thing can be done by a little courage mixed with magic . he paints reform on a banner .
boyd looked uncomfortable , it was , somehow , both an awe-inspiring and a slightly risible sight . six feet one and one half inches tall in his flat feet . [male] posted around over two hundred and twenty pounds of bone . flesh and muscle , he swung a pot belly of startling proportions under the silk shirting he wore . and his face , with its wide nose , small eyes and high forehead .
but he was in the depths again , presently , for when they started down the river and he began to take account of his knowledge . he found that he had none . everything had changed -- that is , he was seeing it all from the other direction . what with the four-hour gaps and this transformation , he was lost completely . how could the easy going , dreamy , unpractical man whom the world knew as mark twain ever have persisted against discouragement like that to acquire the vast .
[female] had always been coldly distant in his relations to the rest of his form . looking on them , with a few exceptions , as worms . and the form , since his innings against [male] 's on the friday . had regarded [male] with respect , so that he escaped the ragging he would have had to undergo at wrykyn in similar circumstances . it was only mr , [male] who gave trouble .
the leading democrat -- does your majesty mean to suggest that the common people of marma . from whom he derives all his just powers , are not to be trusted ? the king . you know i did not mean that , of course i trust the people . i realize perfectly well that they would die for me and all that , but , after all . you can not be sure of everybody in a big crowd .
`` i think this is my dog , '' i said to the guard . and i told him my name . `` i am afraid i have not one with me , '' i explained . when policemen touch me on the shoulder and ask me to go quietly . when i drag old gentlemen from underneath motor 'buses , and they decide to adopt me on the spot .
this total absence of night was not , however , very apparent , for the fog . rain , and snow sometimes enveloped the ship in real darkness . person , who was resolved to advance as far as possible , began to take measures of health . the space between decks was securely enclosed , and every morning care was taken to ventilate it with fresh air . the stoves were installed , and the pipes so disposed as to yield as much heat as possible .
he says he does not want to hear what the child has got to say on the subject . nor on any other subject , neither then nor at any other time , he says there 's going to be a new departure in this house . and that things all round are going to be very different , he suddenly remembers every rule and regulation he has made during the past ten years for the guidance of everybody . and that everybody , himself included , has forgotten , he tries to talk about them all at once . in haste lest he should forget them again .
he invented a new and perfect method , he would buy no tobacco . he would depend on borrowing it ; and , of course . he would be ashamed to [male] often , in a spasm of righteousness he flung his cigar case out of the smoking compartment window . he went back and was kind to his wife about nothing in particular . he admired his own purity , and decided , `` absolutely simple , just a matter of will power . ''
`` i wish , '' she said , and there was a terrible smile in her eyes . `` i wish that something very -- very humorous shall happen to prince udo on his journey . '' everybody likes to make a good impression on his first visit . but there were moments just before his arrival in euralia when prince udo doubted whether the affair would go as well as he had hoped . you shall hear why , he had been out hunting with his friend .
a good gossip with a few chance acquaintances about the family secrets of his employers is food and drink for the stage lawyer . they all go about telling their own and their friends secrets to perfect strangers on the stage . whenever two people have five minutes to spare on the stage they tell each other the story of their lives . `` sit down and i will tell you the story of my life '' is the stage equivalent for the `` come and have a drink ''
the tantalizing stream on the other side of the hedge seemed . to the hot and tired young man , to lead the way straight into the heart of paradise itself . six weary miles of white highway , wavering with heat and misty with hovering dust clouds . still lay between himself and the railroad that would whisk him away to the city . behind him , conquered at fatiguing cost , were six more miles .
this i would regard as a typical instance of the value of a chain of good circumstantial evidence . with no essential link lacking , direct testimony could hardly have been more satisfactory , all things considered . and yet direct testimony is the best sort there is , in the law courts and out . on the other hand , hearsay evidence is viewed legally and often by the layman with suspicion . in most causes of action being barred out altogether , nevertheless , it is a phase of the fattish man 's perversity that .
[female] was round at the back somewhere , and the problem was how to get back without being seen from the dining room window . fortunately a belt of evergreens ran along the path right up to the house . [male] worked his way cautiously through these till he was out of sight . then tore for the regions at the back . the moon had gone behind the clouds , and it was not easy to find a way through the bushes .
and it is fair , so all you have to do is to keep account of the number of times you go up and down in the elevator . and then give the elevator boy five pfennigs for each trip . say you come down in the morning , go up in the evening . and average one other round trip a day . that makes twenty eight trips a week , five times twenty eight is one mark forty .
there was much scuttering about and much meaningless shouting , mr abney 's reedy tenor voice was issuing directions . each of which reached a dizzier height of futility than the last , [male] was repeating over and over again the words . `` shall i telephone for the police ? '' to which nobody appeared to pay the least attention . one or two boys were darting about like rabbits and squealing unintelligibly , a female voice . i think mrs attwell 's -- was saying , `` can you see him ? ''
the room hung breathless on my decision . i wrestled with a horrible desire to shriek and run , instead i managed to mumble an order . the aborigines turned to one another inquiringly , later i learned that fritz was the newest arrival and that since coming to this country he had been rather low in spirits in consequence of a certain flaxen haired lena whom he had left behind in the fatherland . an examination of the dining room and its other occupants served to keep my mind off the hateful long table . the dining room was a double one , the floor carpetless and clean .
archie listened politely ; then went in to get a bite of lunch . his equanimity , shaken by the discovery of the rift in the peerless one 's armour , was restored . good old biddle had taken the girl to the movies last night . probably he had squeezed her hand a goodish bit in the dark . with what result ? why , the fellow would be feeling like one of those chappies who used to joust for the smiles of females in the middle ages .
and at these words the girl pushed raoul out of the room by the shoulders . he glided swiftly down to the porch , regained his horse . mounted , and set off as if he had had monsieur 's guards at his heels . raoul followed the well-known road , so dear to his memory . which led from blois to the residence of the comte [male] la fere .
i like tall women and short , dark women and fair . merry women and grave , do not blame me . ladies , the fault lies with you . every right thinking man is an universal lover ; how could it be otherwise ? you are so diverse , yet each so charming of your kind ; and a man 's heart is large .
david did not hear , in fact he heard nothing from the first crunch of the spade onward . his education was now richer by this fact : once you start out after treasure . you can think of nothing else until it is found . the sun was beating hotly on him , little rivulets of sweat poured down his face and arms . his muscles ached , blisters were beginning to form on his hands .
after that we go back to playing ball on the street in the evenings and swimming sometimes on weekends . one saturday his mother tells me he went to coney island . he did not ask me to go along , which is just as well , because i would not have . i do not hang around his house after school much anymore , either , school lets out . and there 's the fourth of july weekend , when we go up to [location] .
on the stone was cut simply the names , ferdinand lefroy of kilbrack , louisiana . and to these were added the dates of the days on which the man had been born and on which he died . of this stone he had a photograph made . of which he took copies with him . and he obtained also from the minister who had buried the body and from the custodian who had charge of the cemetery certificates of the interment .
meantime , the dutchman , who was not quite so friendless nor so stupid as the yankee supposed . turned the matter over in his mind very coolly , he understood jonathan 's drift as clearly as he understood it himself . and was fully as well satisfied as he was in regard to the future value of the business which he had founded . two of their largest customers were germans , and to them he went and made a full statement of his position . and gave them evidence that entirely satisfied them as to the business .
a boy of adair 's type is always a force in a school . in a big public school of six or seven hundred , his influence is felt less . but in a small school like sedleigh he is like a tidal wave . sweeping all before him , there were two hundred boys at sedleigh , and there was not one of them in all probability who had not . directly or indirectly , been influenced by adair , as a small boy his sphere was not large .
this colonel [male] was a guardsman . he seemed a strange , tired , languid , drawling creature with a long black cigar thrusting out . like a pole from a bush , amidst that immense moustache . he looked from one to the other of [location] with true english phlegm . and he betrayed not the slightest surprise when he was told our intention .
during the last century or so , again , while witchcraft has been extensively believed in . the witch has degenerated into a very vulgar and poverty stricken sort of conjuring woman . take our [location] witches , for instance . they live in cheap and dirty streets that smell bad ; their houses are in the same style . infected with a strong odor of cabbage , onions , washing day .
and you can understand , too , that for her and me together no future is possible , none . i will only try to make an end of it all . the sooner the better , [ a step nearer him . ] eilert lovborg -- listen to me. -- will you not try to . to do it beautifully ? no , no , i have lost my faith in the vine leaves .
this could not be blamed upon his instructress , however , she did all that one woman could to speed him up . sometimes she would even pursue him into the street in order to show him on the side walk a means of doing away with some of his numerous errors of technique . the elimination of which would help to make him definitely the cripple 's superior . the misery of embracing her indoors was as nothing to the misery of embracing her on the sidewalk . nevertheless , having paid for his course of lessons in advance .
the cat had scratched him , the odd job man had swathed him in an apron . and now this stranger , in whom he had found at first a pleasant restfulness . soothing after the recent scenes of violence in which he had participated . did this to him , he dodged the missile and clambered on to the top of the wardrobe . it was his instinct in times of stress to seek the high spots .
the waiter was a tall , stringy man , who gave the impression of having no spine . in that he drooped , he might have been said to resemble a flower . but in no other respect , he had sandy hair . weak eyes set close together , and a day 's growth of red stubble on his chin . one could not see him in the [male] class .
we had delightful and decided summer weather in may . with a flaming sun that permitted the thinnest of raiment , and yet there was a constant breeze . consequently we were never discomforted by heat , at four or five in the afternoon the mercury began to go down . and then it became necessary to change to thick garments , i went togeorge 's in the morning clothed in the thinnest of linen . and reached home at five in the afternoon with two overcoats on .
lord [male] drew in a few breaths of pure long island air . but he did not speak , he felt helpless . if he were to be allowed to withdraw into the privacy of the study and wrap a cold . wet towel about his forehead and buckle down to it . he knew that he could draft an excellent and satisfactory explanation of his presence at reigelheimer 's with the good sport .
i rushed to the beach and rubbed gravel on my face . with such activities , alternated with wild bursts of restraint . our life on the island passed as rapidly as in a dream . had i not taken care to notch the days upon a stick and then cover the stick with tar . i could not have known the passage of the time .
till then i had no notion that it was five minutes since i went into the closet . when she told me the time . five in the afternoon , i groaned in the lowest depths . for , in my breast pocket in that innocent coat . which i could now see lying on the window seat , were the duplicate despatches to mr. [male] .
on the night before camp broke up , a second incident of a sensational kind occurred . which , but for the fact that they never heard of it . would have given the schools a good deal to talk about , it happened that [female] was on sentry go that night . the manner of sentry go is thus , at seven in the evening the guard falls in . and patrols the fringe of the camp in relays till seven in the morning .
[female] , however , cautiously avoided all engagements with that youth . for besides that [male] was an inoffensive lad amidst all his roguery . and really loved blifil , mr thwackum being always the second of the latter . would have been sufficient to deter him , but well says a certain author , no man is wise at all hours . it is therefore no wonder that a boy is not so .
but nothing came of this chance , they lived worthless lives of sin and luxury . and died without honor -- in most cases by violence . only one of them had any ambition ; he was an [male] named connor . he tried to raise a family of fifty children . and scored forty eight , he died lamenting his failure .
she looked askance at me . nobody ever did that to me before and lived to tell the tale . but her sex made me overlook it . had she been any other sex that i can think of . i would have resented it , but i would not strike a woman .
we had arrived at the main entrance of market snodsbury grammar school . i parked the car , and went in , well content , true , the tuppy angela problem still remained unsolved and aunt dahlia 's five hundred quid seemed as far off as ever . but it was gratifying to feel that good old gussie 's troubles were over . at any rate , in this [female] the youth of market snodsbury had been eating its daily lunch for a matter of five hundred years . and the flavour lingered , the air was sort of heavy and languorous .
it is a miserable picture which i am going to give of the weakness of my heart . by owning , that it suffered a pain , which worthier occasions could not have inflicted. . i was mortified with the loss of her hand . and the manner in which i had lost it carried neither oil nor wine to the wound . i never felt the pain of a sheepish inferiority so miserably in my life .
i opened the envelope , no , father 's blessings were absent . the letter was in the third person , professor [male] begged to inform mr. [male] that . by defeating mr. saul potter . he had qualified for the final round of the combe regis golf tournament . in which , he understood , mr. [male] was to be his opponent .
the tourist can step in and view this novel spectacle if he chooses . there 's a poor box , and he will have to contribute , there are several of these big bathing houses . and you can always tell when you are near one of them by the romping noises and shouts of laughter that proceed from it . the water is running water , and changes all the time . else a patient with a ringworm might take the bath with only a partial success .
all the school , down even to [male] , the smallest boy in it . knew all about it , mr. [male] had gone to [location] . and mrs. [female] was going up to [location] to be married once more to her own husband . and the doctor and mr. [female] were both going to marry them . the usher of course knew the details more clearly than that .
the rather that be possible , bring you my coat ? yes , sir , there is it , you have me done to expect too . i did can not to come rather , it do not are finished ? the lining war not sewd . it is so that do one 's now , button me , it pinches me too much upon stomack . the sleeves have not them great deal wideness ?
does enid storm and bullyrag ; threaten that if ever she catches him so much as looking at a card again she will go straight out and tell the dragon . who will in his turn be so shocked that in all probability he will decide on coming back with her to kill and eat the colonel on the spot , no . `` such are not her methods , '' instead she smiles : `` indulgently , '' she says it is only natural for grown ups to like playing cards . she is not angry with him , and there is no need for him to run away and hide in a nasty damp cave . `` she herself will play whist with him . ''
h 'm -- that is what it may come to , all the same , well , well . well -- no doubt you will get it in the end . only after a contest , why , my dearest hedda , how can you be so indifferent about it ? in any case , mrs. [female] . it is best that you should know how matters stand .
then he turns around , blubbering , and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands . and blamed if he did not drop a carpet bag and bust out a crying , if they war not the beatenest lot . them two frauds , that ever i struck . well , the men gathered around and sympathized with them , and said all sorts of kind things to them . and carried their carpet bags up the hill for them , and let them lean on them and cry .
this was where i began to crack under the strain , you see . the part of town where i was living was not the right place for that sort of thing . i knew lots of chappies down washington square way who started the evening at about two a.m. . artists and writers and what not . who frolicked considerably till checked by the arrival of the morning milk .
next morning , early , we drove to the rhone valley and took the train for visp . there we shouldered our knapsacks and things . and set out on foot , in a tremendous rain , up the winding gorge , toward zermatt . hour after hour we slopped along . by the roaring torrent , and under noble lesser alps which were clothed in rich velvety green all the way up and had little atomy swiss homes perched upon grassy benches along their mist dimmed heights .
secrecy has this disadvantage : we lose the sense of proportion . we can not tell whether our secret is important or not , were [female] and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy [male] 's life if he discovered it . or with a little thing which he would laugh at ? miss [female] suggested the former . perhaps she was right , it had become a great thing now . left to herself , [female] would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously .
returning to [location] three days later , i leased a small office in a fire proof power building not far from madison square . fitted it up as if for my own use , and had placed in the concealment of a closet at its easterly end the largest electric fan i could get . it was ten feet in diameter . and was provided with sixteen flanges , when it was in motion not a thing could withstand the blast that came from it . tables , chairs , even a cut glass inkstand weighing two pounds .
first , the walls were to be sized , however , i took a common tape measure and sized the walls . then i put a dishpan on the cook stove . poured in the flour , boiling water and glue . this rapidly produced a dark brown mess of dough , to which i was obliged to add more hot water . it looked extremely repulsive to me , but it looked a good deal better than it smelled .
on the afternoon of the day on which [organization] had been held . the crown prince explored the surrounding country with a view to selecting a golf course . he found a district which was in every way suitable for his purpose . a stretch of undulating land in a valley behind the plateau on which the palace stood . abounding in natural hazards , and affording great facilities for artificial ones .
some natives -- i do not remember how many -- went into my bedroom , now , and put things to rights and arranged the mosquito bar . and i went to bed to nurse my cough , it was about nine in the evening . what a state of things , for three hours the yelling and shouting of natives in the person continued . along with the velvety patter of their swift bare feet . what a racket it was , they were yelling orders and messages down three flights .
`` now construe , '' said barry , looking at the linguist with a bewildered expression . it was a source of no little inconvenience to his friends that [male] bertini was so very fixed in his determination to speak english . he was a trier all the way , was [male] bertini . you rarely caught him helping out his remarks with the language of his native land . it was english or nothing with him .
prehistoric historians erudite and sage , when writing of the past stone age . tell [location] man once was clothed in skins and tattooed patterns on his shins . rough bearded and with shaggy locks he lived in dug outs in the rocks . was often scared and run to earth by creatures of abnormal girth : mammoths and monsters . truth to tell we find their names too long to spell .
entreated him , from that moment , to consider himself one of the family . complimented him highly on his parents or guardians . as the case might be ; and turned him loose in a spacious room on the two pair front . where , in the company of certain drawing boards , parallel rulers . very stiff legged compasses , and two , or perhaps three , other young gentlemen , he improved himself .
among small boys with no head for the game i should probably be described as a clever player . if my opponent only learnt yesterday , and is still a little doubtful as to what a knight can do . i know one or two rather good tricks for removing his queen , my subtlest stroke is to wait until her majesty is in front of the king . and then to place my castle in front of her , with a pawn in support . sometimes i forget the pawn and he takes my castle .
he claims that in the first week of your administration you have basely truckled to the corrupt majority . you have shown yourself to be the friend of men who never claimed to be truly good . if you persist in this course you will lose the respect and esteem of my friend and another man who is politically pure . and who has never smirched his escutcheon with an office , he has one of the cleanest and most vigorous escutcheons in that county . he never leaves it out over night during the summer .
she had learned in secret from her father that he would come up to town for a part of the time . and after that she never let the question rest till she had carried her point . the marchioness had been obliged to confess that , in anticipation of her popenjoy . sir [male] had recommended a change from the country to town . she did not probably remember that sir [female] had done so because she had been very cross at the idea of being kept running down to the country all through may .
recount , o muse . the names of those who fell on this fatal day , first , [male] felt on his hinder head the direful bone . him the pleasant banks of sweetly winding stour had nourished . where he first learnt the vocal art , with which , wandering up and down at wakes and fairs . he cheered the rural nymphs and swains .
she went into the bathroom , bathed her face . and felt better , the dull oppression which comes of a bad night was leaving her . she leaned out of the window , revelling in the fresh air . then crossed the passage and entered her own apartment , stertorous breathing greeted her . and she perceived that gerald foster had also passed the night in a chair .
he was very slow in the telling of the story . slow even in beginning to tell it ; indeed , he hardly knew how to begin . `` you know [male] ? '' he asked . then she understood it all , she might have told him that he could spare himself all further trouble in telling . only that to do so would hardly have suited her purpose ; therefore she had to listen to the story .
his craving for sweets was still unappeased , so at a near by drug store he bought a pound box of candy . the world was again under his feet , restored to his rightful domain . he trod it with lightness and certainty . his mind was still a pleasant jumble of money and food and the montague girl . miles of gorgeous film flickered across his vision .
but for women this ideal of comprehensive capacity must long ago have been washed away . it must have melted in the frightful furnaces of ambition and eager technicality . a man must be partly a one idead man , because he is a one weaponed man . and he is flung naked into the fight , the world 's demand comes to him direct . to his wife indirectly , in short , he must give his best ; and what a small part of a man his best ', is !
at the door [male] hesitated , he had looked forward to this moment as one of excitement and adventure . but now that it had come it had left him in anything but an uplifted mood . he was naturally warm hearted , and his uncle 's cold anger hurt him . it was so different from anything sudden , so essentially not of the moment . he felt instinctively that it had been smoldering for a long time .
april 23.—mr , and mrs. [female] came to meat tea , and we left directly after for the tank theatre . we got a bus that took [location] to [organization] cross . and then changed into one that took [location] to the `` angel. '' mr. [male] each time insisted on paying for all . saying that i had paid for the tickets and that was quite enough , this was humiliating enough . and i could scarcely follow the play , but i was doomed to still further humiliation .
no sooner had la argüello heard that they were hired , than she formed a design upon asturiano . and marked him for her own , resolving to regale him in such a manner . that , if he was ever so shy , she would make him as pliant as a glove . the prudish gallegan formed a similar design upon [location] . and , as the two women were great friends , being much together in their business by day .
the eggs fall out from tilted pail and leave behind a yellow trail . but [male] , -- counting , as he goes . upon his fingers , -- never knows , `` i like that the best , '' said [male] . who knew what it was to tip over a pail of eggs . and felt as sorry for [male] patch as if he really existed .
before her very eyes the stone which the builders had rejected had become the main thing . the hundred to one shot had walked away with the race . a rush of tender admiration for cuthbert banks flooded her heart . she saw that she had been all wrong , cuthbert , whom she had always treated with a patronizing superiority . was really a man to be looked up to and worshipped , a deep , dreamy sigh shook adeline 's fragile form .
the english , like ancient medals , kept more apart , and passing but few people 's hands . preserve the first sharpnesses which the fine hand of nature has given them . they are not so pleasant to feel , -- but in return the legend is so visible . that at the first look you see whose image and superscription they bear. . but the french , monsieur le count , added i ( wishing to soften what i had said ) .
we laugh at her , but are we so very much better ? come , my superior male friend , have you never stood . amid your wardrobe , undecided whether , in her eyes , you would appear more imposing . clad in the rough tweed suit that so admirably displays your broad shoulders . or in the orthodox black frock , that , after all , is perhaps more suitable to the figure of a man approaching .
these clashings of public duty with private inclination are the drawbacks to the despotic position of [female] of cricket at a public school . it is awkward having to meet your best friend after you have dropped him from the team . and it is difficult to talk to him as if nothing had happened . burgess felt very self-conscious as he entered [male] 's study . and was rather glad that he had a topic of conversation ready to hand .
the village was illuminated ; nobody went to bed again ; it was the greatest night the little town had ever seen . during the first half hour a procession of villagers filed through judge [female] 's house . seized the saved ones and kissed them , squeezed mrs. [female] 's hand . tried to speak but could not -- and drifted out raining tears all over the place . aunt [female] 's happiness was complete .
i want you to send teachers and found schools at your own expense . you are four handed and able to do it , and id'no but you had better buy land in their own home you stole them from . buy a small farm for each one that wants to go , travelers say that in the valley of the nile . a country with similar climate and soil to the south land where they wuz born . is an unoccupied place big enough for each one to have a small farm of their own .
the clock struck five -- briskly , as if time were money . ruth warden got up from her desk and . having put on her hat , emerged into the outer office where [male] received visitors . [male] , the ugliest man in [organization] . presided over the local mont de piete , and ruth served him , from ten to five .
at one o'clock a special orchestra , special even in a day of special orchestras . arrived at delmonico 's , and its members , seating themselves arrogantly around the piano . took up the burden of providing music for the gamma psi fraternity . they were headed by a famous flute player , distinguished throughout [location] for his feat of standing on his head and shimmying with his shoulders while he played the latest jazz on his flute . during his performance the lights were extinguished except for the spotlight on the flute player and another roving beam that threw flickering shadows and changing kaleidoscopic colors over the massed dancers .
the remainder of the voyage was uneventful , and , soon after setting his feet on british territory . mr bhosh became an alumnus and undergraduate of the alma mater of cambridge . i shall not attempt to relate at any great length the history of his collegiate career . because , being myself a graduate of calcutta university . i am not , of course , proficient in the customs and etiquettes of any rival seminaries .
outside , in the yard , the crowd momentarily thickened till it formed a dense lane . opening out from the front of the person , and turning to the left down to the south carriage gate . the railings in bridge street andmargaret 's street were banked with people . and ranks were formed on the pavement in front of the grass plot . at a quarter to four the policemen under the shed received the word of command .
smiling indulgently , he lit a cigarette , and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion . he had known [female] for several years . but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical , he could still remember his depression that afternoon at rome . when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue . and demanded to be taken topeter 's , that day she had seemed a typical tourist .
`` this is not any place for me , '' said [male] rabbit . and off he started for the green meadows as fast as he could go , lipperty lipperty lip ! all this time [male] billy possum had been crawling along without the tiniest sound . when he came to the laughing brook , he went up a way until he found a big tree with a branch stretching clear across . of course [male] billy could have swum across , but he did not feel like swimming that night .
it was as he had feared , ruth did not like him . [male] was not the sort of man who makes universal appeal . also , he was no ladies man . he was long and lean and hard bitten . and his supply of conventional small talk was practically non-existent , to get the best out of [male] . as has been said , you had to let him take his coat off and put his feet up on the back of a second chair and reconcile yourself to the pestiferous brand of tobacco which he affected .
merlin laughed inwardly as he compared her to [female] . or rather as he did not compare her , there was no comparison . mr. [male] , mysterious , exotic , and oriental in temperament was . nevertheless , a man of decision , and it was with decision that he approached the problem of his wrecked shop . unless he should make an outlay equal to the original cost of his entire stock .
a bell , in fact , did ring . it announced that madame had finished her toilette . and waited for monsieur to give her his hand , and conduct her from the salon to the refectory . this formality being accomplished with great ceremony , the husband and wife breakfasted . and then separated till the hour of dinner , invariably fixed at two o'clock .
a prominent episode in the indian career of warren hastings had benares for its theater . wherever that extraordinary man set his foot . he left his mark , he came to benares in 1781 to collect a fine of l500,000 which he had levied upon its rajah . cheit singh , on behalf of the east [location] company . hastings was a long way from home and help .
possibly the only member of the castle community who was absolutely indifferent to these public visits was lord marshmoreton . he made no difference between thursday and any other day . precisely as usual he donned his stained corduroys and pottered about his beloved garden . and when , as happened on an average once a quarter , some visitor , strayed from the main herd . came upon him as he worked and mistook him for one of the gardeners .
he felt for his bunch of keys . and made his way to the shed , [organization] shambling behind at an interval of two yards , mr . [male] unlocked the door , and there on the floor was the clue ! a clue that even doctor [male] could not have overlooked , mr . [male] saw it . but did not immediately recognize it for what it was , what he saw at first was not a clue .
[male] was the sixth president of [location] and the eldest son of [male] . he was one of the most eloquent of orators , and shines in history as one of the most [male] of our eminent and bald headed americans . when he began to speak , his round , smooth head . to look down upon it from the gallery , resembled a nice new billiard ball . but as he warmed up and became more thoroughly stirred , his intellectual dome changed to a delicate pink .
nan hurried away , and philo gubb waited only to count the money he had so far received . it amounted to fifty five dollar , he slipped it into his pocket and stood up on the stepladder . he had even proceeded so far as to put one foot on a lower step . when mrs. [female] entered the kitchen . she was a stout woman .
for the first five minutes it was as even a fight as one could have wished to see . it raged up and down the road without a pause . now in a solid mass , now splitting up into little groups , the science was on the side of the school . most wrykynians knew how to box to a certain extent , but , at any rate at first . it was no time for science .
one ground exists for this terror : a strange idea has infected humanity that the skeleton is typical of death . a man might as well say that a factory chimney was typical of bankruptcy . the factory may be left naked after ruin , the skeleton may be left naked after bodily dissolution . but both of them have had a lively and workmanlike life of their own , all the pulleys creaking . all the wheels turning , in the house of livelihood as in the house of life .
it was at about this time that mr. [male] requested to have hot water brought to his room morning and night . for which service he insisted , in spite of miss [female] 's remonstrances . on paying three dollar a week extra , there came a strange man to call one day . he was a member of the [location] law firm . mr. [female] found out that much , but no more , miss [male] was almost hysterical after his visit .
he plucked the pink pearl and the black from where they lay . and rang the bell , his sense of dramatic propriety needed that the girl should . before he addressed her , perform her task of clearing the table . if she had it to perform after telling her love . and after receiving his gift and his farewell , the bathos would be distressing for them both .
everyone 's name is written in alphabetical order on the one side of the ledger and on the other side there is a blank page ruled down the middle with a red line . having made your appearance at ten to ten , you put your initials in a line with your name on the page opposite and to the left of the division . if , on the other hand , you have missed your train . and do not turn up till ten minutes past ten , you have got to initial your name on the other side of the red line . in the space on the right of the line .
for it attracts the eyes of censure . and excites the spirit of inquiry , there is not a family in the county nor a servant in his own house . nor a farmer in the parish , but what knows the utmost farthing that his lands produce . and all these behold him with scorn or compassion . i am surprised that these reflections do not occur to persons in this unhappy dilemma .
clever , cynical and witty , with a philosophical trend that will entertain men and woman alike . the older ones -- the younger ones , read this book for a mirror likeness to yourself . here is a little book of delightful love stories . brimful of clever , witty epigrams . the widow is -- well , say that she is lovable -- only more so .
thereupon the grim faced [female] , strong , silent man of the open , while the cameras ground . waited the coming of one who hounded him for a crime of which he was innocent . his iron face was relentless , he leaned forward , listening . he uncoiled the rope , expertly ran out the noose . and grimly waited , far up the road appeared the detective on a galloping horse .
when the last pirate had disappeared behind the rocks of holmes island . and all was in readiness for action , the good old lady . who had hitherto been as calm and unruffled as a child , began to get red in the face and to bustle about in a manner which betrayed considerable perturbation of spirit . portia meanwhile had discovered the naphtha engine . and , after experimenting several times with the various levers and stop cocks .
her attire was that of a lady , but extremely plain ; and in her manner . even when she sat as still as she did then , there was an indefinable something which appeared to be in kindred with her scrupulously unpretending dress . she had sat , at first looking anxiously towards the bed ; but seeing that the patient remained quiet . and was busy with his writing , she had softly moved her chair into its present place . partly , as it seemed , from an instinctive consciousness that he desired to avoid observation .
oh , mothers knit for their sailor sons socks for their nautical toes . but mothers should list to the frightful noise made by their innocent sailor boys by the wind they blow through their nose . oh , life at sea is wild and free and greatly to be admired , but i would sleep both sound and deep at night when i am feeling tired . so here we go with a yo , person ! person ! while the waves and the tempests soar , an artist can paint a shrew as a saint .
upon coming to my senses , ( for the fall had very thoroughly stunned me . ) i found it about four o'clock in the morning . i lay outstretched where i had fallen from the balloon . my head grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire . while my feet reposed upon the wreck of a small table .
in fact , it was business itself which had compelled mr. rasselyer brown to drink . it is all very well for a junior clerk on twenty dollar a week to do his work on sandwiches and malted milk . in big business it is not possible , when a man begins to rise in business . as mr. rasselyer brown had begun twenty five years ago , he finds that if he wants to succeed he must cut malted milk clear out . in any position of responsibility a man has got to drink .
pursuing his inquiries [male] found that there were no fewer than four majors present . two colonels , one general , and a [male] . so that he could not help thinking how strongly officered the [location] militia must be . and wondering very much whether the officers commanded each other ; or if they did not . where on earth the privates came from , there seemed to be no man there without a title .
there was a grimness in [female] 's voice that caused mrs. [female] to pause in the process of pinning a brooch in her bodice . mrs. [female] looked round . a little startled at a huskiness in [female] 's voice . she was just in time to see him disappear through the bedroom door . when she returned to the looking glass , the face that was reflected back to her was that of a woman in whose eyes there was something of disappointment and cheated longing .
a valiant sailor , that had lost his leg formerly in the wars . was nevertheless , for his great prudence and courage , made [male] of a ship . and being in the midst of an engagement , a cannon bullet took off his wooden supporter . so that he fell down , the seamen immediately called out for a surgeon . `` confound you all , '' said he .
after all , he said , it is the spirit of the thing that counts . following the etiquette of dramatic authors on first nights . he remained discreetly in the background while the procession . with extreme diffidence and the goat , wound its way lugubriously towards the village . the singing had died down long before the main street was reached , but the miserable wailing of pipes brought the inhabitants to their doors .
they had come to the outskirts of a straggling village . the lights in the windows gave a welcome suggestion of warmth . for darkness had fallen swiftly during their walk and the chill of the wind had become more biting . there was a smell of salt in the air now . and once or twice jill had caught the low booming of waves on some distant beach .
the figure proved the loyalty of rodgerson . even [male] admitted that , but it proved unfortunately something else . the eagerness of moss , the claim must have been wanted instantly . for that day , for that morning even , why ? the mystery of moss promised to be a fit pendant to the mystery of pitman . `` and just when all was looking well too , '' cried [male] , smiting his hand upon the desk .
in honolulu a few years from now he will be only a tradition . we all know about father damien , the french priest who voluntarily forsook the world and went to the leper island of molokai to labor among its population of sorrowful exiles who wait there . in slow consuming misery , for death to come and release them from their troubles . and we know that the thing which he knew beforehand would happen . did happen : that he became a leper himself .
yes -- it was a voice , he could hear it quite plainly now . there were angry shouts coming from somewhere below the ledge , carefully avoiding the sight of the pyre . david crawled to the edge and glanced over , far down , on the slope at the foot of the scarp . was a tiny figure dancing and bellowing with rage . the scientist had returned and discovered the ruins of his blind .
of course , as in everything else , one must not be too original on the platform if he is to be served up in every course . if you treat general subjects in anything but a general way . and you are humorous and occasionally satirical , you will find that national failing . want of humour , will tell against you , as well as certain prejudices political and social . the selection of lecturers is generally in the hands of a committee .
when the wondering children had passed out from the school rooms . and were scattering , in slow moving , eagerly talking groups , [female] grant stood for a moment beside her desk . rigid and with all the anguish of her soul revealed , in this instant of solitude . upon her face , `` he is dead , '' she murmured . i know it , i feel it !
if a married couple were to be seen frequently in each other 's company , they would be deemed extremely ungenteel . after ladies are married , they have unbounded freedom . it is a common practice to receive morning calls from gentlemen . before they have risen from bed ; and they talk with as little reserve to such visiters . as they would in the presence of any woman of refinement .
the prospect before mr. [male] for the next three months was certainly very sad . he was to travel from broughton tolouis . and possibly from thence down into the wilds of [location] . in company with this man , whom he thoroughly despised . nothing could be more abominable to him than such an association .
he turned and walked slowly up the path toward the house . as the others pursued their way to the railroad track . down which they presently were plodding on their homeward journey . there was at least a little milk left in the pail when finally they reached their small log cabin . with its yard full of pigs and chickens .
he felt he had been hurled into some new incarnation . into the midst of new relations , wrongs and rights . with towering responsibilities and almost tragic joys which he had as yet had no time to examine . heaven had not merely sent him a message ; heaven itself had opened around him and given him an hour of its own ancient and star shattering energy . he had never felt so much alive before ; and yet he was like a man in a trance .
the atmosphere in the junior study was close . and heavy with a blend of several strange odours , plunkett went to the window . then he noticed what he had never noticed before , that there were no bars to the window . only the glass stood between him and the outer world . he threw up the sash as far as it would go .
he enjoyed the feeling which he was exciting . and paraded the town serene and happy all day . but the young fellows set a tailor to work that night . and when [male] started out on his parade next morning . he found the old deformed negro bell ringer straddling along in his wake tricked out in a flamboyant curtain calico exaggeration of his finery .
what , send her a valentine ? never , i see you do not know who `` she '' is . i should ruin my chances forever ; my hopes would collapse with a fizz . i can not see why she scents such disaster when i take heart to venture a word . i have no dream of becoming her master . i have no notion of being her lord .
every school has to secure the services of such a boy before it can succeed . and so our school had one , when i entered the school i saw at a glance that the board had neglected to provide itself with a boy whose duty it was to nearly kill himself every few days in order to keep up the interest so i applied for the position . i secured it without any trouble whatever . the board understood at once from my bearing that i would succeed . and i did not betray the trust they had reposed in me .
indeed , i doubt not but this ridicule will in general be allowed : my chief apprehension is . as many true and just sentiments often came from the mouths of these persons . lest the whole should be taken together , and i should be conceived to ridicule all alike . now the reader will be pleased to consider , that , as neither of these men were fools . they could not be supposed to have holden none but wrong principles .
the chastened melancholy induced by many months of fetching of pails of water . of scrubbing floors with a mop , and of jumping like a firecracker to avoid excited bees had been purged from him by the lights and the music and the wine . he was telling a long anecdote , laughing at it . throwing a crust of bread at an adjacent waiter . and refilling his glass at the same time , it is not easy to do all these things simultaneously .
he kept that book under lock and key . there was not an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it . but the chance never came , every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book . but no two theories were alike , and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case . now , as becky was passing by the desk , which stood near the door .
at templeton i speedily made known my profession . and soon had a very good medical practice which one or two remarkable cures ', materially increased . i was doing well and making money , i boarded in a respectable farmer 's family . and after living there about six months there came another most unhappy occurrence . from the day , almost , when i began to board with this farmer there sprung up a strong attachment between myself and his youngest daughter which soon ripened into mutual love .
a little ; and we might have slipped when came your rumours and your sales and the foiled rich men . feeble lipped , said and unsaid their sorry tales ; great god , it needs a bolder brow to keep ten sheep inside a pen . and we are sheep no longer now ; you are but masters . we are men , we had held safe your parks . but when men taunted you with bribe and fee .
from the position in which he lay the big man . unable to see that assistance was at hand , continued to roar for help . at the approach of this symbol of the law . mrs. [female] stepped back and brought her mop to the stand at ease position . the policeman looked from one to the other , and then proceeded to ferret somewhere in the tails of his tunic .
he turned to [male] , when there came swiftly into the room lieutenant detective [male] of the central office . [male] was every inch a central office man . and had been long enough at headquarters to lose the heavy bovine set of the man who pounds the pavement . a strapping big fellow , with graying hair and a pair of round bullet eyes that searched you with needle points . his very appearance was sufficient corroboration of all the thrilling stories the newspapers printed of his skill and courage .
and [male] , having cleansed his stuff d bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart . shoved the stick energetically once more through the railings , jill darted forward . always a girl who believed that , if you want a thing well done . you must do it yourself . she had applied to [organization] for assistance merely as a matter of form .
the public school is not a sort of refuge for aristocrats . like an asylum , a place where they go in and never come out . it is a factory for aristocrats . they come out without ever having perceptibly gone in , the poor little private schools . in their old-world , sentimental , feudal style , used to stick up a notice .
i saw an aged , aged man one morning near the row . who sat , dejected and forlorn , till it was time to go , it made me quite depressed and bad to see a man so wholly sad . i went and told him so , i asked him why he sat and stared at all the passers-by . and why on ladies young and fair he turned his watery eye . he looked at me without a word .
but suddenly a monstrous bear began to roar behind me , with a voice like thunder . i turned round , and seeing the creature just ready to devour me . having the bladder of liquor in my hands . through fear i squeezed it so hard . that it burst , and the liquor flying in the eyes of the animal .
the other touched the beach at pahang ; and he was taller than the smoke of three volcanoes ! as he rose up through the branches of the wonderful tree he tore off one of the great twin fruits . the magic double kernelled nuts that make people young . and the little girl daughter saw it bobbing alongside the canoe . and pulled it in and began to pick out the soft eyes of it with her little golden scissors .
because it is pecuniarily inconvenient to me to be anywhere else , notice. -- the gentleman who . the other day , ran away from home , without stopping to take his breath . is requested to fetch it as quickly as possible , you start a company to make it go . it fails , and so you drop it . it did not go but yet has gone , and so you wind it up to stop it .
tinling felt that those girls were laughing at him ; they had probably been in the secret for some time . but he could not care much just then -- the relief was so delicious , `` my dear cecilia , '' was the reply , would o not be uneasy , i did think of it . the moment they begin to feel at all uncomfortable they have directions to open a certain packet which explains the whole thing . if the gallant general had not been in quite such a hurry , he would have spared himself this unpleasant experience .
at last a wave larger than the others struck the face of the low cliff with a shock that seemed to leave it trembling . and sent the cold salt spray dashing up into the siren 's face . she sprang forward to the edge and looked over , with a sudden terror lest the ledge below should be bare . but her victim lay there still , bound fast by her spell . and careless of the death that was advancing upon him .
why this fact should so greatly excite speech day orators is not known . but they seldom fail to proclaim it with intense and parental enthusiasm . then , after a few apposite remarks upon the subject of mens sana in corpore sano . a flight of originality received with murmurs of anguish by his experienced young hearers . the old gentleman concludes with a word of comfort to `` the less successful scholars . ''
the police magistrate , before whom they were hurried and tried . was a mr. [male] , a cheerful , middle-aged gentleman . honourably celebrated for the lightness of his sentences and the lightness of his conversation . he occasionally worked himself up into a sort of theoretic rage about certain particular offenders . such as the men who took pokers to their wives .
she clapped her hands with glee . eyes and feet dancing in unison . as she capered along gaily beside me ; a sort of skippety hop . skippety hop , sideways , keeping pace with my more stately step . as if she were a little girl of six instead of a young woman of twenty .
The Confessions of a Caricaturist, Vol. 2 by [male] as i walked back into the drawing room . one of the musical humorists of the day was cleverly taking off the weak points of his brother musicians . and bringing out into strong light their peculiarities and faults of style . the entertainment , however , did not tend to raise my drooping spirits , for i was sad to think how low our modern art had sunk . and with a heavy heart and a sigh for the profession i pursue .
but sheen now understood thoroughly , what he ought to have learned from his study of the classics . that the happy mean was the thing at which to strive , and for the future he meant to aim at it . he would get the gotford , if he could . but also would he win the house boxing at his weight . after he had rested he discovered the use of the big ball beneath the table .
The Intrusion of Jimmy by [female] at [organization] everybody in the room on this july night had come from the theater . most of those present had been acting , but a certain number had been to the opening performance of the latest better than raffles play . there had been something of a boom that season in dramas whose heroes appealed to the public more pleasantly across the footlights than they might have done in real life . in the play that had opened to night , [male] , an exemplary young man off the stage . had been warmly applauded for a series of actions which , performed anywhere except in the theater .
silence fell , he knew not what to say , he felt himself in one way innocent . but he felt himself in another way blackly guilty . his remorse for the telephone trick which he had practised on rose [male] burst forth again after a long period of quiescence simulating death . and acutely troubled him ... no , he was not guilty , he insisted in his heart that he was not guilty ! and yet -- and yet -- no taxi cab ever travelled so quickly as that taxi cab .
on the road we wuz travelin the child [female] no doubt often passed in play with other children or at work . i wonder how he felt as he stood amongst his playmates and if a shadow of what wuz to come rested on his young heart ? i spoze so , for he wuz only twelve when he reasoned with the wise doctors . there is one fountain that supplies the town and always has , and we see stately dark eyed wimmen carryin tall jars of water on their heads ( how under the sun they ever do it is a mystery to me .
on his way out mr. [male] met [male] coming in . detective [male] , outside the house , examined the cellar window as well as he could . there was not a mark to be seen from the outside , but a pansy bed bore the marks of the un burglar 's exit . to get out of the cellar , the un burglar had had to wiggle himself out of the small window . and had crushed the pansies flat , detective [male] felt carefully among the crushed pansies .
these sirens of the drawing board were invariably smelling a rose or kissing a canary , and always had a weakness for pearls . they used to be drawn upon tinted paper , and when the faces had been duly smeared over with the stump to suggest shadow . and after the drawing master had endowed the work with artistic merit by the application of white chalk to the high lights . the pearls , the canary 's eyes . and the pathetic tear drops upon the damsels faces , the immortal productions were ready for framing .
there was an old man of [location] , whose form was uncommonly thin . till he once , by mistake , was mixed up in a cake . so they baked that old man of [location] . there was an old man of the west , who never could get any rest . so they set him to spin on his nose and his chin .
he found himself in a passage way covered with mother of pearl . where many electric lights were hidden in shells of most exquisite tintings . at the other end of the passage was a door studded with costly gems . timtom walked up to this door and knocked on it . immediately it swung open , and the youth found himself in a chamber entirely covered with diamonds .
with hats pulled over their eyes and coat collars turned up . they would pass the dark doorway of willcox [male] . let themselves be picked up , and then lead poor detective gubb across rubbish encumbered vacant lots . over mud flats or among dark lumber piles . only to give him the slip with infinite ease when they tired of the game .
the boys soon got about him , but he kept them off with his staff . requesting them to speak to him from a distance . lest they should break him , seeing that he . being a man of glass , was exceedingly tender and brittle , but far from listening to his request . the boys , who are the most perverse generation in the world .
barton looked exceedingly sheepish , lady griskin flirted her fan . mrs tabby groaned in spirit , liddy changed countenance . and mrs jenkins sobbed as if her heart was breaking . my uncle , with a sneer , asked pardon of the ladies . for having interrupted their devotion , saying , he had particular business with the preacher .
this was the late train that he had come down by , most of the school had returned earlier in the afternoon . he reached blackburn 's at eight o'clock . and went up to his study to unpack , this was always his first act on coming back to school . he liked to start the term with all his books in their shelves . and all his pictures and photographs in their proper places on the first day .
they went into a hollow and up a gentle wooded slope . and came at last to a high and open space overlooking a wide expanse of country . there , by a common impulse , they stopped , she looked at her watch . a little ostentatiously , they stared at the billows of forest rolling away beneath them . crest beyond crest , of leafy trees .
be joyfull with this , till such time as the t'other pleasure begins to appear . behold , young couple , hitherto a considerable deal of time is spent and passed over . with the aforesaid mirth and pleasures ; do not you now perceive what a vast difference is between the married or unmarried estate ? you have , by provision , made your self master of these six pleasures . nay oftentimes before you have gotten the longd for joy of the fourth pleasure .
the warden laughed heartily , and sent for deputy morey who came in to `` see a gentleman , '' and was much astonished to find the prisoner , who , two years before , had saved his life from the hands and knife of the madman [male] . i spent a very pleasant hour with my old enemies , and i took occasion to give them a hint or two with regard to the proper treatment of prisoners . i then made the rounds of the prison . and went into the dungeon where i had passed so many wretched hours for weeks at a time .
but after that hour singles would be as valuable as threes and boundaries an almost unheard of luxury . the policy proved successful for a time , as it generally does . [location] , who relied on a run that was a series of tiger like leaps culminating in a spring that suggested that he meant to lower the long jump record . found himself badly handicapped by the state of the ground . in spite of frequent libations of sawdust .
it had , of course , hoped for the best , but it had not expected that the best would be quite as bad as this . the best , to put it frankly , would have been a bandaged arm , or something of that kind . there was still room for the more hardened optimist to hope that something of some sort had occurred . or that something of some sort had been averted , and that the whole affair was not . in the delicious new slang phrase of the padre 's , which was spreading like wildfire through tilling .
he had not seen [male] for some time . and absence had made the heart grow fonder . it embittered him that his meetings with her were all too rare nowadays . she seemed to have abandoned the practice of walking altogether , for , whenever he saw her now she was driving in the automobile with bill , [male] information about the new system threw some light upon this and made him all the more anxious to meet her now .
in the centre , standing beside the rail , were dean drone and dr. gallagher . looking through binocular glasses at the shore , up in front on the little deck forward of the pilot house was a group of the older men . mullins and duff and mr. [male] in a deck chair . and beside him mr. [male] , the undertaker of mariposa . on a stool , it was part of mr. [male] 's principles to take in an outing of this sort .
well , it stunned me so , when i first found it out . that i could not believe it ; it did not seem natural . but as soon as my mental sight cleared and i got a right focus on it . i saw i was mistaken ; it was natural , for this reason . a king is a mere artificiality , and so a king 's feelings .
amid cheers the procession started , the band . which had a few minutes before blown itself to silence , was now devoting itself enthusiastically to `` [organization] . '' on the box the kangaroo , known in private life as [male] trent . the [male] of thejoseph 's boat . performed a few innocent tricks , to the great diversion of the crowd .
we find a combination which makes it possible for [location] to admit our learning and still be held honorable men . it is a good sign that his following is increasing . a text book on english composition , giving examples of good and bad letter writing . is always a mine of possibilities for one given to ruminating and with nothing in particular to do . in `` business man 's english '' the specimen letters are unusually interesting .
by the same rule , a succession of wives will only induce an habitual or mechanical regard to the wife for the time being . in the same way as loyalty may be transferred from one sovereign to another . besides , a family with different degrees of relationship and with different interests is formed . and this contributes nothing towards domestic tranquillity . there may be some particular cases in which the evils to which we have alluded may not arise .
`` stop , '' he cried as [male] turned away . percy was rattled , the crisis found him in two minds . on the one hand , he would have been prepared to take oath that this man before him was the man who had knocked off his hat in piccadilly . the likeness had struck him like a blow the moment he had taken a good look at the fellow . on the other hand , there is nothing which is more likely to lead one astray than a resemblance .
he slipped his hand into his pocket and drew out a great roll of money . with the muzzle of philo gubb 's pistol hovering just out of reach before him . he counted out five crisp one hundred dollar bills . he held them out with a sickly grin . philo gubb took them and looked at them , puzzled .
the reason for lord [location] 's visit to [male] had been twofold . in the first place , lady [male] had told him to go . that would have been reason enough , but what made the visit imperative was an unfortunate accident of which he had only that morning been made aware . it will be remembered that [female] had told [female] that the gardener with whom she had become so friendly had taken her name and address with a view later on to send her some of his roses . the scrap of paper on which this information had been written was now lost .
she has excelled at none of the outdoor games perhaps . she has spoken hardly a word at meals . in our little company she has scarcely seemed to count , but suddenly she awakes into life . clumps is the family game at home . she has been brought up on it , in a moment she discovers herself as our natural leader .
the ex votos , or pictures and figures here described . are too familiar to the visitor of catholic churches to need any explanation . here rodaja beheld that very chamber of the virgin . wherein was delivered the most stupendous embassy ever heard or witnessed by all the heavens . all the angels , and all the archangels , or other inhabitants of the everlasting abodes .
that small share of sense which mr partridge had hitherto preserved through this scene of fury . of the cause of which he was hitherto ignorant , now utterly abandoned him . he ran instantly into the street , hallowing out that his wife was in the agonies of death . and beseeching the neighbours to fly with the utmost haste to her assistance . several good women obeyed his summons , who entering his house .
at the consul 's desk a beautiful creature . all in lace and pearls , was struggling to compress the very low opinion she held of a hurricane into ten words . on his knee , [male] , the banker . was inditing instructions to his wall street office . and upon himself livingstone had taken the responsibility of replying to the inquiries heaped upon marshall 's desk .
the curious thing is that the same man , who as an individual is as helpless as a child . becomes , the moment he puts on the uniform . an intelligent being , capable of responsibility and initiative . the german can rule others , and be ruled by others , but he can not rule himself . the cure would appear to be to train every german for an officer .
for one can not recommend a book to all the hundreds of people whom one has met in ten years without discovering whether it is well known or not . it is the amazing truth that none of those hundreds had heard of the wind in the willows until i told them about it . some of them had never heard of [male] ; well , one did not have to meet them again . and it takes all sorts to make a world . but most of them were in your position -- great admirers of the author and his two earlier famous books .
everyone would see the humour of so simple a classification . but this is what we have done with this lumberland of foolish writing . we have probed , as if it were some monstrous new disease . what is , in fact , nothing but the foolish and valiant heart of man . ordinary men will always be sentimentalists : for a sentimentalist is simply a man who has feelings and does not trouble to invent a new way of expressing them .
the fat man -- well , not exactly , but he lives in one of the most accessible parts of the suburb . and we have him up quite often , he 's popular on account of his after dinner stories . what i might call his physical humor is delightfully reminiscent and archaic , the fat man . oh , yes , brand new ones , no tonsils or appendixes , of course . that is , not as a rule , we have to bring in a few tonsils every year to amuse our doctors .
all this while blackburn 's had been doing what was expected of them by beating each of their opponents with great ease . there was nothing sensational about this as there was in the case of [female] 's . the latter were , therefore , favourites when the two teams lined up against one another in the final . the school felt that a house that had had such a meteoric flight as [female] 's must . by all that was dramatic -- carry the thing through to its obvious conclusion , and pull off the final .
ah , his confidence in a fatherhood more omniscient than his own had not been misplaced . loving hands had borne his darling safely through the waves to a home where . in an atmosphere of devotion , the beauty that had been in her from the beginning had perfected in its maturity . even the homely surroundings of the environment into which she drifted could not stifle her native fineness of soul . bred up a fisherman 's daughter she had lived and moved among plain .
in serving writs i made such a name that an articled clerk i soon became . i wore clean collars and a brand-new suit for the pass examination at the institute . and that pass examination did so well for me . that now i am the ruler of the queen 's navee , of legal knowledge i acquired such a grip that they took me into the partnership . and that junior partnership , i ween .
it is true , indeed , that , in order to prove its strength . he drew his sword , and gave it two strokes . the first of which instantly demolished the labor of a week ; but not altogether approving of the facility with which it was destroyed . and in order to secure himself against a similar misfortune . he made another visor , which , having fenced in the inside with small bars of iron .
i shall never forget the first occasion on which i saw the late lord [female] . it was in the old days when the law courts were in westminster . and i , in search of `` character , '' strangely enough found myself wandering about the divorce court . where so many characters are lost , it was a cause celebre .
they all entreated him to bring it without delay . and then they took their leave of him . after agreeing that on the following night they would make a hole in the turning box with a gimlet . and that they would try and persuade their mistress to come down , by this time it was nearly daylight . yet the negro wished to take a lesson , loaysa complied with his desire .
he had put his hand on the one really first class forward st austin 's possessed . and proposed to remove him from the team , and yet through it all he was perfectly well meaning . the fact that personally he rather disliked payne had . to do him justice , no weight at all with him . he would have done the same by his bosom friend under like circumstances .
a quarter of an hour later , [male] , the valet . sunning himself in the stable yard , was aware of the daughter of his employer approaching him . [male] , said billie . she was still pale , her face was still hard , and her eyes still gleamed coldly , `` miss ? '' said [female] politely , throwing away the cigarette with which he had been refreshing himself .
i accept them because it seems to me to be nobler in the mind so to do rather than by opposing to end them . and so to my story , i have prefaced it at such length for but one reason . and that is that i am aware that there will be those who will doubt the veracity of my tale . and i am anxious at the outset to impress upon all the unquestioned fact that what i am about to tell is the plain . unvarnished truth , and , as i have already said , it happened last christmas eve .
we sailed out from arcachon across the lake to the person park . here the water is so shallow that the men who tend the beds walk about them in waterproof boots coming up to their knees . this part of the bay is dotted with boats with white canopies . seen at anchor from arcachon they look like boats laid up for the winter season . but every one is tenanted night and day , they are the homes of the guardians of the person beds .
it had to be at an angle suggestive of piquancy . and it had to contain at least the suspicion of a dimple . to properly understand her complexion you were expected to provide yourself with a collection of assorted fruits and flowers . there are seasons in the year when it must have been difficult for the conscientious reader to have made sure of her complexion . possibly it was for this purpose that wax flowers and fruit .
nutty took his astonishment , which was too great to be concealed , as a compliment , he chuckled . bill walked down the long passage to his bedroom with no trace of the sleepiness which had been weighing on him five minutes before . he was galvanized by a superstitious thrill , it was fate . [male] brother turning up like this and making friendly overtures right on top of that letter from her . this astonishing thing could not have been better arranged if he had planned it himself .
manilov 's heart was moved to the core . again and again did the two friends press one another 's hands in silence as they gazed into one another 's tear filled eyes . indeed , manilov could not let go our hero 's hand . but clasped it with such warmth that the hero in question began to feel himself at a loss how best to wrench it free . until , quietly withdrawing it , he observed that to have the purchase completed as speedily as possible would not be a bad thing .
`` but come , '' said mr. [male] , after he had finished adjusting the gravel with his foot . there are mrs. [female] and the girls on the verandah . let 's go and join them , for the little girl in green looked at mr. [female] with wide eyes . and when she looked at him she saw all at once such wonderful things about him as nobody had ever seen before . for she could see from the poise of his head how awfully clever he was .
`` i guess she had some reason , '' said [male] , absently , he was inclined to be absent during these days . his mind was always stealing away to occupy itself with the problem of the discovery of [organization] . the motives that might have led a stenographer to resign her position had no interest for him . at this moment there came from the outer office a piercing squeal .
here comes a hiatus , i am told that i was seen dancing . was observed to eat an excellent supper , and was noticed in the smoking room with a cigarette in my mouth . at last the first of my two waltzes , the [female] boating song . one of my favourites , i threaded my way through the room in search of her . she was in neither of the doorways , i cast my eyes about the room .
i changed to the [location] edge of the island to see what luck i could have . and i war not disappointed , a big double loaf come along . and i most got it with a long stick , but my foot slipped and she floated out further . of course i was where the current set in the closest to the shore . i knowed enough for that , but by and by along comes another one , and this time i won .
he scrambled in , removing several layers of white paint from the window sill as he did so . he was determined to have that syringa , he took it dripping from the vase . and was preparing to depart , when the door opened and a fat woman appeared upon the threshold . the scream that she emitted at sight of [female] curdled the very blood in his veins . she dashed to the window , and [male] .
the two were destined to meet , nearer and nearer they came . and then still nearer , then for one brief moment they met . as they passed [female] raised her head and directed towards the young nobleman two eyes so eye like in their expression as to be absolutely circular . while lord [female] directed towards the occupant of the dogcart a gaze so gaze like that nothing but a gazelle . or a gas pipe , could have emulated its intensity , was this the dawn of love ?
dawn was already breaking , i looked about me . as the sudden beams of the tropic sun illumined the placid sea . i saw immediately before me , only a hundred yards away , an island . a sandy beach sloped back to a rocky eminence , broken with scrub and jungle . i could see a little stream leaping among the rocks .
it used to be the custom of some very old-fashioned clubs in this city . when a gentleman asked for change a guinea . always to bring it to him in washed silver . that which had passed immediately out of the hands of vulgar being considered `` as too coarse to soil a gentleman 's fingers . '' so , when the city snob 's money has been washed during a generation or so .
if flour has been placed in their hands , it makes no difference as to their getting those members out of or into the ropes . but , to show hands at the aperture , or to make a noise on the musical instruments . it is necessary that they should get the flour out of one hand into the other . the moisture of the hand and squeezing . packs the flour into a lump , which can be laid into the other hand and returned without losing any .
ah , but do not you want them to have the old home to come back to ? `` no place like home '' for children , eh ? you are right -- can not have too much of it , most children only have one home . ours will have two , when they get bored with one they can try the other , i see , quite so . but your aunt [female] and i were joined together by a pink parasol made in [location] .
botley station lies in a cutting . overhead was the roadway , and across the lemon yellows and flushed pinks of the sunset . there whirled a great black mass , a horse like a long nosed chess knight . the upper works of a gig , and [male] in transit from front to back . a monstrous shadow aped him across the cutting .
anyone desiring to monkey with the carpenter 's trade . will do well to consult my catalogue and price list , i will throw in a white holly corner bracket . put together with fence nails , and a rustic settee that looks like the [location] riot . young men who do not know much , and invalids whose minds have become affected . are cordially invited to call and examine goods , for a cash trade i will also throw in [location] .
there was a beetle sitting next to the goat ( it was a very queer carriage full of passengers altogether ) . and , as the rule seemed to be that they should all speak in turn . he went on with `` she will have to go back from here as luggage ! '' alice could not see who was sitting beyond the beetle , but a hoarse voice spoke next . `` change engines -- '' it said .
i rush in undignified haste to the window . shall i -- will i -- go and help this long expected miss [female] to alight ? no , -- for i see forty boxes on the coach top . a very handsome girl , really , i will get out a blameless dickey . if such there be , first impressions are important , i wish my hair was cut !
`` and did he die that night ? '' i asked . breathless with excitement , [male] again fell into silence . anxious as i was to hear the rest of his astounding narrative , i did not like to press him with questions . the fact that our relations had hitherto been only of a formal character . and that this was the first occasion on which he had invited me to visit him at his rooms .
how happy a thing it is that you have made use of a learned doctor . and an experienced midwife , now is the only time to be very carefull , for fear the least accident might turn the tide with the young woman . and so she get a mischance , or some other sad mishap . and a mischance is worse for her than a true child bearing ; for that weakens nature abundantly . and oftentimes brings with it several sad consequences .
let [location] not be too particular , it is better to have old second hand diamonds than none at all . pudd'nhead [female] 's new calendar , november 27 , today we reached gisborne . and anchored in a big bay ; there was a heavy sea on , so we remained on board . we were a mile from shore . a little steam tug put out from the land ; she was an object of thrilling interest .
but it was just too late , he had turned away , and the horses were in motion . she continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed . they were half way down the hill . and every thing left far behind , she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed . almost beyond what she could conceal , never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved .
for one of the first persons we saw in carlisle . was the lieutenant in [location] persona . bargaining with a horse dealer for another steed , in the yard of the inn where we alighted . mrs bramble was the first that perceived him , and screamed as if she had seen a ghost . and , truly , at a proper time and place , he might very well have passed for an inhabitant of another world .
a young female gypsy , more remarkable for her wit than her beauty . had decoyed the honest fellow aside , pretending to tell his fortune , now , when they were alone together in a remote part of the barn . whether it proceeded from the strong liquor , which is never so apt to inflame inordinate desire as after moderate fatigue . or whether the fair gypsy herself threw aside the delicacy and decency of her sex . and tempted the youth partridge with express solicitations .
his daughter let me out of the house door when i went . i guess she would been pretty scared that she would done wrong about letting me in . but i said to her it was all right , and after that when i wanted to see the old man i would always ask for her and she would see that i got in all right . got them squeezed out ? oh , yes , easy , there was not any trouble about that . you see the old man worked up a sort of jolt in wholesale leather on one side .
and with that i left the old gentleman and walked blushing back to the office . i do not doubt for an instant the truth of the baron 's story . but somehow or other i feel that in writing it my reputation is in some measure at stake . note -- mr. [male] . upon request of the editor of the [location] gazette to write a few stories of adventure for his imp 's page .
that feeling of utter collapse , which is the immediate result of a blow in the parts about the waistcoat . was beginning to pass away , and sheen now felt capable of taking an interest in sublunary matters once more . his ear smarted horribly , and when he put up a hand and felt it the pain was so great that he could barely refrain from uttering a cry . but , however physically battered he might be , he was feeling happier and more satisfied with himself than he had felt for years . he had been beaten , but he had fought his best , and not given in .
yet , in spite of all this , mr. [male] was annoyed , he realized now how large a part the desire to reduce [male] self esteem had played with him , he further realized . looking at the thing honestly , that he had been firmly convinced that the young man would not come within a mile of a reasonable solution of the mystery . he had desired only that his failure would prove a valuable educational experience for him . for he believed that failure at this particular point in his career would make [male] a more valuable asset to the agency .
that the `` raps '' were produced by disembodied spirits many firmly believed , false communications were attributed to evil spirits . the answers to questions were as often wrong as right . and only right when the answer could be easily guessed , or inferred from the nature of the question itself . mrs. [female] , a relative of the fox girls . made a solemn deposition before a magistrate , to the effect that one of the girls had instructed her how to produce the `` raps , ''
i agree in this latter part , for the whole affair struck me as intensely funny . and not at all appalling -- in fact , i spent a very delightful afternoon . a lady whose dress the papers described as a costume of brown brocade and lace ', played beautifully . another dressed in grey satin and chiffon ', sang charmingly . a third who wore `` a skirt of black and a primrose bodice trimmed with lace ''
for a moment it looked like being real nicholls and jackson stuff . but , fortunately , a quick zig on my part , coinciding with an adroit zag on the part of the pig . enabled me to win through , and i continued my ride safe . but with the heart fluttering like a captive bird , the effect of this narrow squeak upon me was to shake the nerve to the utmost . the fact that pigs were abroad in the night seemed to bring home to me the perilous nature of my enterprise .
one night i awoke and found myself in a watermelon patch . i was never so ashamed in my life , it is a very serious thing to be awakened so rudely out of a sound sleep . by a bull dog , to find yourself in the watermelon vineyard of a man with whom you are not acquainted . i was not on terms of social intimacy with this man or his dog . they did not belong to our set , we had never been thrown together before .
it was the sort of occurrence . said [male] , which proved once and for all the existence of an all seeing , benevolent providence . as for [male] , he had smoothed out a few of the more important mountain ranges which marred the smoothness of the wicket . and was feeling that all was right with the world , the pair started well . the demon bowler of the enemy , having been feted considerably under the trees by enthusiastic admirers during the innings of his side .
there was nothing further settled , and very little more said , when lord [female] left the deanery and started back to manor cross . but with [female] there had been left a certain comfort , the shopkeepers and dr. [female] had seen her with her husband . and mr. [male] had met lord [male] at the deanery door . on a certain day early in august lord [male] had gone with a return ticket to a town but a few miles distant from brotherton to sit on a committee for the distribution of coals and blankets . and in the afternoon got into a railway carriage on his way home .
with the picture of a dissipated clubman in evening dress on the box cover . were different , in that they were pointedly hidden from [male] , he cared little for cigars . but this was a challenge ; the old boy could not get away with anything like that . if he did not want his cigars touched let him leave the box out in the open like a man . [male] drew upon the lighted trophy , moistened and pasted back the wrapper that had broken when the end was bitten off .
that he had to contribute to the support of the majority of these friends might have seemed a drawback to some men . kirk did not object to it in the least , he had enough money to meet their needs . and , being a sociable person who enjoyed mixing with all sorts and conditions of men . he found the liberty [male] regime pleasant . he liked to be a magnet , attracting [location] bohemian population .
it chanced on this particular occasion , that mrs gamp had been up all the previous night . in attendance upon a ceremony to which the usage of gossips has given that name which expresses . in two syllables , the curse pronounced on [female] . it chanced that mrs gamp had not been regularly engaged . but had been called in at a crisis , in consequence of her great repute .
but it is hard to move a new english acquaintance when he is by himself . or when the company present is small and new to him . he is on his guard then , and his natural reserve is to the fore . this has given him the false reputation of being without humor and without the appreciation of humor . americans are not englishmen , and [location] humor is not english humor .
unless an amendment in this sense was accepted , it might be necessary to reconsider the act of union of 1707 . the leader of the government said that lord rosebery 's amendment was the best he had heard yet . the government accepted it at once , they were willing to make every concession . they would , if need be , reconsider the norman conquest , the duke of devonshire took exception to the part of the clause relating to the production of the sides . he did not think the country was prepared for it .
why , then , in this up to date geography book , should we depict the giddy globe in an obsolete hoop skirt of imaginary zones ? in striving to answer the question , we have hit upon a pleasing compromise . [female] and e. are the two extremities of the giddy globe . which are quite bare , [female] is the corset , which being hot and uncomfortable corresponds to the torrid . some people are sensitive about their ages , the giddy globe has never told [location] hers .
this time , suspicion was somewhat heightened by the dress of the visitors . [female] had to explain about six times that the costumes were part of an [organization] arrangement . that he had not stolen his identity cards . that [male] 's cards were [male] 's . too , and in general that the four of them were not insane , not spies .
early in the morning partridge appeared at the bedside of [male] . ready equipped for the journey , with his knapsack at his back . this was his own workmanship ; for besides his other trades , he was no indifferent [male] . he had already put up his whole stock of linen in it . consisting of four shirts , to which he now added eight for mr [male] .
they were forbidden to leave the kingdom , their property was sequestrated . they were placed in custody and examined , those of them in parliament were insulted there to their faces . several of them expelled , the most violent charges made against them all . a secret investigating committee was set to rip up the whole affair . knight , the treasurer , who possessed all the dangerous secrets of the concern .
i should like to tell you of other interesting people i saw . of my perambulations through baxter street . the jewish quarter , of the visits to the joss house . opium joint , grocery stores . halls of dazzling delight , and dens of iniquity i made that night .
it is remarkable that for a writer who seems to have left such an indelible imprint in the minds of the [location] people . whose works have been ranked with the greatest of all time and who received more publicity during one day of his visit here than [male] dickens received during his whole sojourn in [location] . señor blasco and his works form a remarkably small part of the spontaneous literary conversation of the day . the characters which he has created have not taken any appreciable hold in the public imagination . their names are never used as examples of anything .
it made me feel real good and important to run them off . quite often i went with her to the a and p and helped her carry home the cat food and cottage cheese and fruit . she talks to herself all the time in the store . and if she thinks the peaches or melons do not look good that day . she shouts clear across the store to the manager .
when he said he had travelled with this lady he was merely boasting . he would like to have travelled with her , that was all he meant . only his german was shaky , joy once more entered upon the scene . my friend 's character appeared to be re established , he was not the abandoned wretch for whom they had taken him . only , apparently , a wandering idiot , such an one the german official could respect .
it was dark by the mantelpiece , jill took the photograph to the window . where the fading light could fall on it . why , she could not have said , but the thing interested her , there was mystery about it . it seemed in itself so insignificant to have the place of honour . the shadows deepened , the top of the great building swayed gently .
ten hours later the o'hara will was the one matter talked about in riverbank . evidently there must be some clue leading to the solution of the mystery . some well hidden , cleverly planned key such as [organization] would undoubtedly have left in perpetrating such a joke . common sense was sufficient to tell any one that o'hara could not have written both wills simultaneously . that he had written one will on one side of the paper .
he was a tall and slender young fellow . with a handsome face , an eye clear , [male] , and keen . and a mouth which , but for the moustache which shadowed it . might have been pronounced too strong for beauty , a moment he stood looking with growing pity upon the grieving woman . and then he turned and silently tip toed across the room and to the outer door .
the mate and the sailor went out together , and jean and [female] remained alone . many bitter tears were shed during that sad evening , [female] , seeing [female] so wretched . resolved to spare her the pain of separation by leaving the house on the morrow without her knowledge . so he gave her a last kiss that evening . and at three o'clock next morning was up and away , the departure of the brig had attracted all the old sailor 's friends to the pier .
[ accompanying him to the door . ] good-bye my dear judge , you must really excuse me . [ judge brack goes out by the [male] door . [ crosses the room , ] oh hedda -- one should never rush into adventures , eh ? yes , dear -- there is no denying -- it was adventurous to go and marry and set up house upon mere expectations .
mr , [male] suddenly started , his eye had been caught by the water pipe at the side of the window . the boy whom sergeant collard had seen climbing the pipe must have been making for this study . he spun round and met psmith 's blandly inquiring gaze . he looked at psmith carefully for a moment , no . the boy he had chased last night had not been psmith .
poor draggled dandy felt more ashamed of it and himself than ever . and he was glad to get away under its ragged hangings and lie still by [male] 's dirty boots till he was wanted . and then there was the sound of children 's voices and laughter as they all came trooping in . with a crisp rustle of delicate dresses and a scent of hothouse flowers and kid gloves . that reached dandy where he lay : it reminded him of evenings long ago when [male] had had parties .
this made the temple a regular shop , where the priests traded off promised benefits for real beef . coining blessings into cash on the nail . a very thorough humbug , such public religious ceremonies as the heathen had were mostly annual , sometimes monthly . there were also daily ones , which were , however , the daily business of the priests . and none of the business of the laymen .
there is no obsession more dangerous to its victims than a conviction especially an inherited one . of superiority : this world is so full of missourians . and from his earliest years [male] , junior , had been trained to believe in the importance of the magsworth family . at every meal he absorbed a sense of magsworth greatness . and yet , in his infrequent meetings with persons of his own age and sex .
both the father and the daughter were of the sort that would normally have avoided all observation . that is , all observation in that extraordinary modern world which calls out everything except strength . both of them had strength below the surface . they were like quiet peasants owning enormous and unquarried mines . the father with his square face and grey side whiskers .
i want to see you come up smiling ; i want to feel you in the business . not only on pay day but every other day . i want to know that you are running yourself full time and overtime . stocking up your brain so that when the demand comes you will have the goods to offer . so far , you promise to make a fair to ordinary salesman among our retail trade .
the queen had no great difficulty in coming to the same conclusion . and went at once to see isabella , who seemed to be almost at the last gasp . sending with all speed for her physicians , she , meanwhile . ordered that the sufferer should be given a quantity of powdered unicorn 's horn and several other antidotes . with which great princes are usually provided against such casualties , the physicians arrived and begged the queen to make the lady keeper declare what kind of poison she had used ( for no one doubted that she was the poisoner ) .
he escaped from her grasp and fled to the showroom . where , in sheer self defence , he moved a table and three chairs across the door . the room was empty except for [female] , the blue dog . and the still sleeping smuts , all that was left of the giant was the crumpled sheets . [male] had , with an awe stricken `` by jove , '' snatched up his rat as he fled .
that her consent ( for so he construed the words . `` you know , sir , i must not , nor can , refuse to obey any absolute command of yours '' ) had made him the happiest of mankind . he then gave her a large bank bill to dispose of in any trinkets she pleased . and kissed and embraced her in the fondest manner , while tears of joy trickled from those eyes which a few moments before had darted fire and rage against the dear object of all his affection .
hunger is a luxury to us . a piquant , flavor giving sauce , it is well worth while to get hungry and thirsty merely to discover how much gratification can be obtained from eating and drinking . if you wish to thoroughly enjoy your dinner , take a thirty mile country walk after breakfast and do not touch anything till you get back . how your eyes will glisten at sight of the white table cloth and steaming dishes then ! with what a sigh of content you will put down the empty beer tankard and take up your knife and fork !
but [female] went in and failed to come out , this was not [male] 's fault . however , for the manager released his hold on his stomach long enough to get a grip on [male] 's collar . the striker 's defiance seemed to displease him . and , because he could not shake [male] , he shook [male] . and he said things to [male] that he would have preferred to say to [male] .
we were interested in the wardrobe and the jewels . and in the silverware , and its grace of shape and beauty and delicacy of ornamentation . the silverware is kept locked up , except at meal times , and none but the chief butler and the prince have keys to the safe . i did not clearly understand why , but it was not for the protection of the silver . it was either to protect the prince from the contamination which his caste would suffer if the vessels were touched by low caste hands .
i apologize for speaking so earnestly , algernon , but i saw by your letter that you felt kindly toward me . and rather invited an expression of opinion on my part . so i have written more freely , perhaps , than i otherwise would , we are both writers . measurably so , at least , you write on progressive euchre , and i write on anything that i can get hold of . so let [location] agree here and promise each other that , whatever we do , we will not think through the thinker of another man .
the simple words rang out fresh and sweet upon the morning air . it was [female] of the highlands . she was gathering lobsters in the [female] that ran through the glen . the scene about her was typically highland , [female] rose on both sides of the [female] to a height of seventy five feet . covered with a dense highland forest that stretched a hundred yards in either direction .
it had the body of a zebra . the legs of a rhinoceros , the neck of a giraffe . the head of a bull dog . and three corrugated tails , this monster at once began to growl and run toward her . showing its terrible teeth and lashing its three tails , the princess snatched the mirror from her basket and .
suddenly will o' the wisp opportunity flickered before him , and in his high mood he paused not at all to consider it . but insanely chased it , he had just reached a crossing . and down the cross street , walking away from noble , was the dim figure of a man carrying an umbrella . it was just perceptible that he was a fat man . struggling with seeming feebleness in the wind and making poor progress .
perhaps some inkling of how he was going to feel in the morning worked through to gerald 's muddled intelligence . for he winced , and his manner took on a deeper melancholy . may not be alive in the morning , he said solemnly , good mind to end it all . end it all , he repeated with the beginning of a sweeping gesture which was cut off abruptly as he clutched at the friendly door . `` oh , go to bed , '' she said impatiently , the strange frozen indifference which had gripped her was beginning to pass .
the applicant , who introduced himself as mr. [male] . expressed himself as quite satisfied with all he saw , and agreed to enter into possession on the following monday afternoon . at a rental of three and a half guineas a week . he appeared mildly surprised at bindle waiving the question of references and a deposit . but agreed that the smaller bedroom should be kept locked , as containing the owner 's personal possessions .
the body that lies buried here by lightning fell , death 's sacrifice . to him [male] 's fate was given he rode on flames of fire to heaven . stay , reader , drop upon this stone one pitying tear and then be gone . a handsome pile of flesh and blood is here sunk down in its first mud . my wife from me departed and robbed me like a knave .
you know , perhaps , how a remark of that sort can stay and rankle . and make you wish you could hear it again to make sure of it . because perhaps you did not hear it aright , and it was a mistake after all . perhaps no one said it , anyway , you ought to have written it down at the time . i have seen the dean take down the encyclopaedia in the rectory .
from his place at the other crease [female] could see miss [female] and her mother sitting under the trees . watching the game , the sight nerved him . by the time he had played through his first over he had reduced [male] 's lead by half . an [male] would have hit out in such circumstances , and [male] was always an aggressive batsman . by the end of the third over the scores were level , each had made 20 .
she had been writing poetry that morning . and she wore green , she always wore green when the muse was upon her . a pleasing habit which , whether as a warning or an inspiration . modern poets might do well to imitate , she carried an enormous diary under her arm . and in her mind several alternative ways of putting down her reflections on her way to the palace .
beyond melons , of whom all this is purely introductory , there was little to interest the most sanguine and hopeful nature . in common with all such localities , a great deal of washing was done . in comparison with the visible results , there was always some thing whisking on the line . and always some thing whisking through the court , that looked as if it ought to be there . a fish geranium -- of all plants kept for the recreation of mankind .
it is always safer for a spy to preserve his natural appearance if that is possible . because a false beard or false moustache or wig run the risk of being deranged or torn away . as i have said , an anarchist assemblage is simply a room filled with the atmosphere of suspicion . i have known instances where an innocent stranger was suddenly set upon in the midst of solemn proceedings by two or three impetuous fellow members . who nearly jerked his own whiskers from his face under the impression that they were false .
the cistercian monks , whose abbey stood there in the thirteenth century . wore no clothes but rough tunics and cowls . and ate no flesh , nor fish , nor eggs , they lay upon straw . and they rose at midnight to mass . they spent the day in labour .
as the [location] millionaire had discovered before me that it was impossible to give a shillingsworth for sixpence ( although i ran it for a longer period than he did ) . i ceased its publication , few papers , it has been said . were more admired than this artistic and refined new budget , and i take this opportunity of denying that it was in any way a failure compared with papers in existence for years still losing money . and i am sincerely proud of my contribution to the publishing of periodicals . but had i not been deceived , and dropped lika joko , that paper would now have been a splendid property .
the three sailors repaired the tent , which , torn in several places . permitted the snow to fall on the deck , the temperature was exceedingly cold . and kept so till the return of the sun , which did not reappear above the horizon till the 8th of january . [male] was buried on the coast , he had left his native land to find his son . and had died in these terrible regions , his grave was dug on an eminence .
the little old man made no response , he studied the burning face . the drooping lashes ; he also looked meditatively at some footprints on the floor . they may not have been as startling in their significance as were the famous marks crusoe discovered in the sand . but they were quite as illuminating , a trail of small ones led about the room and beside them . as if echoing to their light tread , was a series of larger ones .
[female] and homer and pindar had all this grace . and pith and these sallies , -- and if i read [female] and homer and pindar . and if they only read mrs. [female] and mrs. [female] then where were they ? so continued lying brought its own reward in the sense of superiority and i lied more . when i reflect that i have openly expressed regret .
she took it , and for a moment stood irresolute . then with a quick movement , she lifted it and stabbed three times at the ceiling . a girl stood on the shingle that fringes [female] . gazing at the red roofs of the little village across the water . she was a pretty girl , small and trim , just now some secret sorrow seemed to be troubling her .
it had an unfenced grass plot in front of it which seemed about as big as a billiard table . and this grass plot slanted so sharply downward , and was so brief , and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge of the absolute precipice . that it was a shuddery thing to think of a person 's venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated at all . suppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard . there would be nothing for him to seize ; nothing could keep him from rolling .
ahasverus , yes , it is you . you have the olympic forehead . strong and beautiful titan ; it is you indeed ... are these your chains ? i see upon them no trace of your tears , ahasverus . and humanity wept far more because of your crime , ahasverus . what need have i of your words ?
he stooped to tickle [male] , who had finished stropping his claws and was now enjoying a friction massage against his leg . and began to brood on the inscrutable way of fate , suppose he had never gone down to marvis bay that time . he had wavered between half a dozen places . it was pure chance that he had chosen marvis bay . if he had not he would never have met old nutcombe .
he began to listen to what he said , and even to make some attempt at answering a question which appeared to have been put several times and was now put with some excess of emphasis . [male] realized that the image of god in nickel buttons was asking him how he had come there . he said that he had come in [male] 's ship . on his giving this answer the demeanour of the image of god underwent a remarkable change . from addressing [male] gruffly , as if he were a malefactor .
this was delivered in a very jerky manner , with occasional twitchings of the face and violent claspings of the hand . which her visitor retained , although it gave him a cold sweat to do it . johannes , who has friends in [location] . and whose questions were therefore all in good faith , tried to get the sleeping female to descend a little more to particulars . to describe individuals or localities minutely enough to be recognised if the descriptions approached the truth .
[female] , and applied himself to the dessert with rather an injured expression . his father felt a greater sense of constraint and worry than ever . the interview , as he had feared , seemed likely to last some time . and he felt that he ought to improve the occasion in some way . or , at all events , make some observation , but , for all that .
you had better go and hear it all at the disabilities . lady [female] , said guss , lady [female] said that she would like to go for once . and so that matter was settled , while aunt [female] was pouring out the violence of her doctrine upon the dean . whom she contrived to catch in a corner just before she left the house . guss mildmay had a little conversation on her own part with lady [female] .
so urged the poor man started again , and found his brother still alive , but senseless . this was towards the end of march , and it is hoped that the reader will remember the event which was to take place on the 1st of april . the coincidence of the two things added of course very greatly to his annoyance . [male] might come to him twice a day . but no telegram could bring him back in a flash when the moment of peril should arrive .
here , however , i suggest a plea for a brutal publicity only in order to emphasize the fact that it is this brutal publicity and nothing else from which women have been excluded . i also say it to emphasize the fact that the mere modern veiling of the brutality does not make the situation different . unless we openly say that we are giving the suffrage . not only because it is power but because it is not . or in other words , that women are not so much to vote as to play voting .
i got those cigars your father sent me . thank him an tell him if he ever gets takin like that again not to send such a large box but well you explain it to him mable . you can do that sort of thing much better than i can , outspoken . thats me all over , mable , why is it that no matter how fussy a fello was when he wore a vest as soon as he begins to call a coat a blouze no one thinks he knows whats what . if you got any old magazenes what was old before the war started send em to the soldiers .
the head , who had had to leave his house in the small hours in his pyjamas and a dressing gown . was not in the best of tempers , he had a cold in the head . and also a rooted conviction that mr , [male] , in spite of his strict orders . had rung the bell himself on the previous night in order to test the efficiency of the school in saving themselves in the event of fire . he received the housemaster frostily , but thawed as the latter related the events which had led up to the ringing of the bell .
when she got back to the palace she drank two glasses of warm milk . with the skin on , and then went and weeded the countess 's lawn . and once when she trod by accident on a bed of flowers . she left the footprint there instead of scraping it over hastily . and pretending that she had not been near the place , as you would have done .
judith , the beautiful and intellectual daughter . kept house for her illustrious father , and entered heartily into all his social and business schemes for the improvement of the town of stratford . thus days , weeks , months and years were passed in pleasant conclave with literary and neighboring friends . until the winter of 1615 and 1616 , when a severe throat trouble afflicted the bard . in conjunction with acute pains in the head .
then he was seized with remorse , and knelt beside his adversary and tried to revive him . he managed to raise him up , and propped his body against his own . he passed his arm round him . again he was filled with pity and tenderness . he awaited the revival without fear .
seek the golden mean of life , like the temperate regions . it has but few thorny plants . be doubly careful of those to whom nature has been a niggard , the oak and the palm take their own forms under all circumstances . the fungi seem to owe theirs to outward influences . it is a poor plant that crisps quickly into wood .
the lighthouse stands on the farthest point , jutting into the sea . and has at the right of it [location] . and on the left east bay , a signboard on the top of a pole stuck in the shingle . almost within hail of the lighthouse , announces the proximity of `` the pilot . '' `` the pilot '' is a small shanty run up on the shingle .
this time the order came too late ; for the squall struck her with the suddenness of a shot . and she canted over till her keel lay out of water . and , when she righted , it was with the white surf boiling over her . `` she 's a good boat , then , to stand that , '' said billy . as he struck a light for his pipe .
i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times . well , i was most all the time at it . because it was about the only way to put in the time . but this time i found something at last . i found an old rusty wood saw without any handle .
ada talked almost the whole time in a sprightly manner . which gave leander no opportunity of introducing the subject of his engagement . and this continued until they had reached a small battlemented platform on some rising ground . below were the black masses of trees , with a faint fringe of light here and there . beyond lay the thames , in which red and white reflections quivered , and from whose distant bends and reaches came the dull roar of fog horns and the pantings of tugs .
old higgins met [location] at the station with a somewhat rickety cart . to which was attached the ancient cob that the late earl used to shoe . we entered a noble person , which probably looked the larger because of the entire absence of any kind of furniture . unless two complete suits of venerable armour which stood on either hand might be considered as furnishing . i laughed aloud when the door was shut , and the sound echoed like the merriment of ghosts from the dim timbered roof above me .
penrod was not altogether surprised by the onset of his friend . he had been aware of [male] 's increasing irritation ( though neither boy could have clearly stated its cause ) . and that very irritation produced a corresponding emotion in the bosom of the irritator . mentally , penrod was quite ready for the conflict -- nay , he welcomed it . though , for the first few moments , [male] had the physical advantage .
[female] escaped from jail and organized an army . which in 1265 defeated the rebels , and leicester and his son were slain . the wicked soldiery wreaked their vengeance upon the body of the fallen man . for they took great pride in their prowess as wreakers . but in the hearts of the people leicester was regarded as a martyr to their cause , [male] .
i seem to recall what happened once when a certain middleweight from this side went over there and broke the british heart by licking the british champion . and again what happened when a yankee boy won the marathon at the olympic games in [location] a few years ago . but as this man was a briton himself these other britons harkened to his sputterings . for england , you know , grants the right of free speech to all englishmen . and denies it to all englishwomen , the settled englishman declines always to be jostled out of his hereditary state of intense calm .
without wishing to alarm the [location] people , or create a panic . i desire briefly and seriously to discuss the great question . `` whither are we drifting , and what is to be the condition of the coming man ? '' we can not shut our eyes to the fact that mankind is passing through a great era of change . even womankind is not built as she was a few brief years ago .
they were men whose minds . at one period , had taken the wrong turning , these people . although they calmed the frenzy of the extremists . nevertheless regarded the possible rapprochement between england and [male] with grave apprehension . if [male] and england became as friendly as [male] and [location] .
the case of yodel , the auctioneer . was even more inscrutable , he had been to the oddfellows excursion on the train the week before and to the conservative picnic the week before that . and had decided not to go on this trip , in fact , he had not the least intention of going . he narrated afterwards how the night before someone had stopped him on the corner of nippewa and tecumseh streets and asked . `` are you going to take in the excursion tomorrow ? ''
protest from the insurance people ? legal proceedings to prevent payment ? my dear sir ! i see you know nothing about the mariposa court . in spite of the fact that i have already said that it was one of the most precise instruments of british fair play ever established . why , judge pepperleigh disposed of the case and dismissed the protest of the company in less than fifteen minutes !
with the disturbance thus set up in the nervous system were coupled , in many instances . mental aberrations , particularly in regard to pecuniary matters . `` give me not silk , nor rich attire , '' pleaded one poet of the period to the british public . `` nor gold nor jewels rare , '' here was an evident hallucination that the writer was to become the recipient of an enormous secret subscription . indeed , the earnest desire not to be given gold was a recurrent characteristic of the poetic temperament .
`` one word , [male] ; only one word , '' and he still held her , he saw that there was a flash in her eye as he stepped back . so he begged her pardon . and muttering something about hoping to hear from her soon , took his leave , poor man ! i do not see why she should not have accepted him .
it is a very mysterious affair , and i am glad we are going away . we have been travelling about a good deal since we left munich . we went first to heidelberg , we arrived early in the morning at heidelberg . after an all night journey , and the first thing that the proprietor of the royal suggested . on seeing us , was that we should have a bath .
as it was , the two men staggered out on to the fairway again with a score of eight apiece . once past the [male] and round the bend of the road . the hole becomes simple , a judicious use of the cleek put [male] on the green in fourteen . while [male] , with a braid iron . reached it in twelve , [male] was down in seventeen .
that night [male] obeyed the letter of the law by keeping the rats in a box on his bedroom window sill . the household was roused in the early hours of the morning by piercing screams from [male] 's room . the more adventurous of the pair -- named rufus -- had escaped from the box and descended to [female] 's room by way of the creeper . [female] awoke suddenly to find it seated on her pillow softly pawing her hair . the household , in their various sleeping attire , flocked to her room at the screams .
coming down again , he took a stick under his arm and was about to set forth when he noticed a little drift of talcum powder upon one of his patent leather shoes . after carefully removing this accretion and adding a brighter lustre to the shoe by means of friction against the back of his ankle . he decided to return to his room and brush the affected portion of his trousers . here a new reverie arrested him ; he stood with the brush in his hand for some time . then , not having used it , he dropped it gently upon the bed .
there is a guest with an alligator , but especially there is a cat . he is fat , his name is [male] . he belongs to an [location] woman . she is fat , she exhibits him to me . he is wrapped in a silk and fur creation like an opera cloak .
the tears of joy then shed by cornelia were many and long continued . infinite were the acknowledgments she offered to heaven , innumerable the kisses she lavished on her son . and profuse the thanks which she offered from her heart to the two friends . whom she called her guardian angels on earth . with other names , which gave abundant proof of her gratitude .
a month went by before i passed that way again . i looked across at the little store and i read the story in its drawn blinds and the padlock on its door . the little druggist had gone away for a spell , and they told me . on enquiry , that his journey had been no further than to the cemetery behind the town where he lies now . musing , if he still can , on the law of the survival of the fittest in this well adjusted world .
no , there war not no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell . you would see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then . and they generly landed in your plate , or down the back of your neck . and most of the time where you did not want them . well , they was handsome and striped , and there war not no harm in a million of them .
no one came into the building from friday afternoon until monday morning . so the donkey got very hungry , and certainly would have starved had he not chanced to taste of a geography that was sticking out from one of the desks . the hungry donkey decided it was not so very bad , so he ate it all up . then he ate an arithmetic , an algebra , and two first readers . after that he lay down and went to sleep ; but becoming hungry again he awoke and commenced on the school library .
it so happened that i was giving a series of lectures in the vicinity of [location] . and i was stopping with a friend of mine . the director of the art gallery and museum there . he suggested my leaving my gladstone bag . containing my change of clothes , in his office .
i knew how the shafts of calumny and envy might be aimed at me by his relations . so i would take along one on his side to share my responsibility . so if he did lose his mind and could not find it agin . they could not find fault with me and say i had not done my best . so i proposed that his niece , blandina teeter .
the lid went up , and the sisters began to unroll the precious garments . which seemed all enshrined in aromatic gums and spices , the odor of that interior lives with me to this day . and i grow faint with the memory of that hour . with pious precision the clothes were uncovered , and at last the whole suit was laid before my expectant eyes , reader ! i am an old man now , and have not long to walk this planet .
there is no question of degree in matrimony . you can be a little bit in love or a little bit ill . but you can not be a little bit married or a little bit dead . telling lies is a fault in a boy . an art in a lover , an accomplishment in a bachelor .
two of my men has gone home on furlos . me [organization] i took all there blankets . the men didnt like it but i got a squad of men to look out for an my first duty is to keep fit , duty first . thats me all over , i got so many blankets now that i got to put a book mark in the place i get in at night or id never find it again . we spent most of our time tryin to find somethin to [male] up in the sibly stoves .
and it was with these words that they came in sight of the great plains . they went a little way in silence . and then [female] said suddenly , `` but i cannot believe in the thing . '' [female] answered nothing to the speech . perhaps it is unanswerable , and indeed they scarcely spoke another word to each other all that day .
they were walking back very leisurely ; martin arm in arm with mr [male] , and the major and the colonel side-by-side before them . when , as they came within a house or two of the major 's residence . they heard a bell ringing violently , the instant this sound struck upon their ears . the colonel and the major darted off , dashed up the steps and in at the street door like lunatics . while mr [male] , detaching his arm from martin 's .
his experiences , unpleasant as they had been , had had their advantages . they had drawn him and his family closer together . in his daughter [female] , as she wished him good night ( knowing nothing . of course , of the escape ) , he had suddenly become aware of a girlish freshness and grace he had never looked for or cared to see before . roly after this , too , had a claim upon him he could never wish to forget .
he had the makings of a brilliant golfer . but a combination of bad luck and inconsistent play invariably robbed him of the fruits of his skill . he was the sort of player who does the first two holes in one under bogey and then takes an eleven at the third . the least thing upset him on the links . he missed short putts because of the uproar of the butterflies in the adjoining meadows .
she danced among the unfinished ways that merge into the strand . a maid whom none could fail to praise , and very few withstand , a sylph . accepted for the run , not at a weekly wage ; fair as a star when only one is shining on the stage . she met a lord , and all men know how soon she would done with me . now she is in debrett , oh , and , that 's where they all would be !
but he also picked up a sword as he stepped to open it . he paused one moment with his hand on the handle and then flung the door open . almost as he did so the ferrule of an ordinary bamboo cane came at his eyes . so that he had actually to parry it with the naked weapon in his hands . as the two touched , the point of the stick was dropped very abruptly , and the man with the stick stepped hurriedly back .
it is not the difference between ninetynine persons and a hundred persons . it is one person -- the people . i do not know or care how many or how few of the belgians like or dislike the pictures of wiertz . they could not be either justified or condemned by a mere majority of belgians . but i am very certain that the defiance to [location] did not come from a majority of belgians .
we talk fine things about women . but in our hearts we know that they are very limited beings . most of them , we honor them for their functional powers . even while we dishonor them by our use of it . we honor them for their carefully enforced virtue .
their first act was to bore a hole in the turning box through which they might peep at the musician . who was no longer clad in rags , but in wide breeches of buff silk . cut sailor fashion , a jacket of the same material . a satin cap to match , and a starched double pointed ruff , all which he had brought in his wallet . expecting that he would have to show himself on an occasion which would require him to change his costume .
the best among [location] have their failings , and it must be conceded of mrs prig . that if there were a blemish in the goodness of her disposition . it was a habit she had of not bestowing all its sharp and acid properties upon her patients ( as a thoroughly amiable woman would have done ) . but of keeping a considerable remainder for the service of her friends . highly pickled salmon , and lettuces chopped up in vinegar .
it is unexplainable , the average woman 's passion for cupboards . in heaven , her first request , i am sure , is always , `` can i have a cupboard ? '' she would keep her husband and children in cupboards if she had her way . that would be her idea of the perfect home , everybody wrapped up with a piece of camphor in his or her own proper cupboard . i knew a woman once who was happy -- for a woman , she lived in a house with twenty nine cupboards .
from that we got to talking about natural phenomena and storms . i spoke of the cyclone with some feeling and a little bitterness . perhaps , briefly telling my own experience , and making the storm as loud and wet and violent as possible . then a gentleman from [location] , named [male] . an old cattleman , was telling of a cyclone that came across his range two years ago last september .
the next worst thing in the world is a railroad train . he dies twice a mile regularly , but -- [male] said , `` come at once . '' so , with his suit case full of green river , hermitage and other well-known mineral waters . a couple of lemons ( who had been playing for [male] shouse at convention [male] the previous week ) . and his orpheum pass , poor lehman boarded the night train for [location] .
we sat there an hour , with chattering teeth and quivering bodies . and quarreled over all sorts of trifles , but gave most of our attention to abusing each other for the stupidity of deserting the railway track . we sat with our backs to the precipice . because what little wind there was came from that quarter , at some time or other the fog thinned a little . we did not know when , for we were facing the empty universe and the thinness could not show .
then , having paid for what mrs honour had eaten , in which bill was included an account for what she herself might have eaten . she mounted her horse . and , once more assuring her companion that she was perfectly easy , continued her journey . containing , among other things , the ingenuity of partridge . the madness of [female] , and the folly of fitzpatrick .
after the death of powhatan , the friend of the english . an organized attempt was made by the indians to exterminate the white people and charge more for water frontage the next time any colonists came . march 22 , 1622 , was the day set , and many of the indians were eating at the tables of those they had sworn to kill . it was a solemn moment , the surprise was to take place between the cold beans and the chili sauce . but a converted indian told quite a number , and as the cold beans were passed .
in a sort of dull panic i sat down immediately on my arrival . and tried to work , i told myself that i must turn out something . that it would be madness to waste a moment , i sat and chewed my pen from two o'clock till five . but not a page of printable stuff could i turn out , looking back at myself at that moment . i am not surprised that my ideas did not flow , it would have been a wonderful triumph of strength of mind if i had been able to write after all that had happened .
and so it was arranged , no one in the house was told of the new plan . lady susanna having with difficulty been brought to promise silence . lady [female] 's visit was of course announced . and that alone created great surprise , as lady [female] very rarely left home . the marchioness had two or three floods of tears over it .
`` impossible , my boy , '' the phoenix groaned as it shifted into a more comfortable position . david raced home to collect the necessary things for the trip . remembering how cold it had been last time , he took his leather jacket out of the closet . and a pair of gloves and a scarf . for the phoenix he borrowed a bottle of liniment and took all the cookies from the cooky jar .
[female] had not been well disposed towards the invaders before . but now he ran amok , hitting out right and left at random , his right missed . but his left went home hard on some portion of somebody 's anatomy . a kick freed his ankle and he staggered to his feet . at the same moment a sudden increase in the general volume of noise spoke eloquently of good work that was being put in by psmith .
or , if he does , chooses not to reveal it , he is a monomaniac . but perfectly harmless , and calls himself [male] quail . i have learned from other sources a few facts of his history . he sleeps anywhere and everywhere , and eats in the same localities . nobody ever harms him , all being familiar with his whims .
these bizarre attempts at explanation were followed by others equally bizarre . of late years however , an anonymous writer , by a course of reasoning exceedingly unphilosophical . has contrived to blunder upon a plausible solution -- although we can not consider it altogether the true one . his essay was first published in a [location] weekly paper . was illustrated by cuts , and was entitled `` an attempt to analyze the automaton chess player of maelzel . ''
pretty to see the steward when the flood in the saloon got half a foot deep ladle it out with a [location] . [male] comforts [location] with assurance that having crossed the [location] man and boy for forty years . he never went through such a storm , have been at sea a bit myself . only once , coasting in a small steamer off [location] , have i seen -- or , since it was in the main pitch dark . felt -- anything like it , [male] turned up at dinner last night .
and there she stays till the morning light . so i know it is only pretend ; but binkie , he snores at my feet all night . and he is my firstest friend , `` my shadow , '' by [male] , is one of the most popular short poems extant , i have taught it to a great many very young boys . and not one has ever tried to evade learning it , older pupils like it equally well .
[female] was playing [female] , [female] is entirely dutch . [male] is entirely irish , result , [male] , on his opening show . did not get a laugh or a hand , after his act was over he stood around . dazed , for a few minutes ; then he made his way over to the `` peek hole , '' looked out and sized up the audience carefully , then turned away , muttering to himself .
there is a peculiar idea abroad that the value and fascination of what we call nature lie in her beauty . but the fact that nature is beautiful in the sense that a dado or a liberty curtain is beautiful . is only one of her charms , and almost an accidental one , the highest and most valuable quality in nature is not her beauty . but her generous and defiant ugliness , a hundred instances might be taken , the croaking noise of the rooks is . in itself , as hideous as the whole hell of sounds in a [location] railway tunnel .
he said that i could go through from [location] to [location] . [location] , with only one easy change of cars . and in about twenty three hours , it took me twice that time . and i had to change cars three times in the dead of night . the southern railroad is not in a flourishing condition , it ought to go somewhere for its health .
remember , too , that it 's easier to look wise than to talk wisdom . say less than the other fellow and listen more than you talk ; for when a man 's listening he is not telling on himself and he 's flattering the fellow who is . give most men a good listener and most women enough note paper and they will tell all they know . money talks -- but not unless its owner has a loose tongue . and then its remarks are always offensive , poverty talks .
we started off -- four in a taxi , it was mr. [male] who . with florid politeness , handed eve to her seat . and it was mr. [female] who entertained [location] on the way with light conversation . luigi 's face , when he met the parkers and myself at the entrance of the restaurant . was a study , his polite bow and smile of welcome seemed suddenly frozen on his face as his eyes fell upon mr. [male] .
so the warden directed that i should be put at work in the brush shop . where all kinds of brushes were made , mr. [male] was the officer in charge of this shop . and mr. [male] , the contractor for the labor employed in the brush business , was present . both of these gentlemen took pains to instruct me in the work i was to begin upon . and were very kind in their manner towards me .
without another word she stalked resolutely along the platform in the direction of the signal box . the old porter happening to glance over his shoulder saw her coming . and broke into a shambling trot , determined to obtain the moral support of young [male] before another encounter . drawing his pipe from his pocket , bindle sank down upon the tin bath . jumping up instantly , conscious that something had given way beneath him with a crack suggestive of broken crockery .
the two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through lover 's lane and across the crusted field beyond . for the snow was too deep to go by the shorter wood way . [female] , although sincerely sorry for [female] may , was far from being insensible to the romance of the situation and to the sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a kindred spirit . [female] may did not take kindly to the ipecac but [female] had not brought up three pairs of twins for nothing . down that ipecac went , not only once , but many times during the long .
he turned out a great number of these works in the course of the term . as well as faces in pen and ink with moving tongues and rolling eyes . and these he would present to a few favoured friends with a secretive and self depreciatory giggle . amidst scenes and companions like these . paul sat out the evening hours on his hard seat .
he seemed bored all the time , and i could see by the way he acted that he pined to be back in [male] . o. , having his picture taken for the poultry keepers guide and [location] eggist . he still yearned for approbation , he was used to being made of . as your mother says , and it galled him to enter into our plain .
that sustains [location] and helps [location] to bear the hard toils and burdens of the day of life . and that go with [location] through the valley and the shadow . the only revelation we have of god 's will to man . the written testimony of his love and compassion . and the only map in which we trace our titles clear to a heavenly inheritance .
it about convinced me that there is not any such thing as a new joke possible . everybody laughed at these antiquities -- but then they always do . i had noticed that , centuries later , however , of course the scoffer did not laugh . i mean the boy , no , he scoffed ; there was not anything he would not scoff at . he said the most of sir [male] 's jokes were rotten and the rest were petrified .
also we saw a complete skeleton of the giant moa . it stood ten feet high , and must have been a sight to look at when it was a living bird . it was a kicker , like the ostrich . in fight it did not use its beak . but its foot , it must have been a convincing kind of kick .
however , when , after a subsequent period of seclusion , she emerged from her stateroom wearing the same disheveled look that [male] must have worn when he and the whale parted company . do you think she would confess she had been seasick ? not by any means , she said she had had a raging headache . but she could not fool me , she had the stateroom next to mine and i had heard what i had heard . she was from near [location] and she had the near boston accent .
but just in one phase of the public speaking , the candidacy of mr. [male] received a serious set back . it had been arranged that mr. [male] should run on a platform of total prohibition . but they soon found that it was a mistake . they had imported a special speaker from the city . a grave man with a white tie .
she could , from behind a curtain negligently half drawn across the side of the window nearest the house . have an eye on her housemaid at work . and notice if she leaned out of a window , or made remarks to a friend passing in the street . or waved salutations with a duster , swift upon such discoveries . she would execute a flank march across the few steps of garden and steal into the house .
[female] , another sample , was a huge , good natured , flax headed lubber . lazy , sentimental , full of harmless brag , a grumbler by nature . an experienced , industrious , ambitious , and often quite picturesque liar , and yet not a successful one . for he had had no intelligent training , but was allowed to come up just any way . this life was serious enough to him , and seldom satisfactory , but he was a good fellow .
after his twelfth lesson , when he had learned the ground work of the art . and had begun to develop a style of his own , like some nervous batsman at cricket who does not show his true form till he has been at the wickets for several overs . the dog loving francis gave him a trial . this was a very different affair from his spars with [male] . [male] was one of the cleverest boxers at his weight in england .
accordingly , two days after the house boxing he was observed to issue from [male] 's with his left arm slung in a first fifteen scarf . he was too astute to injure his right wrist , what happens to one 's left wrist at school is one 's own private business . when one injures one 's right arm , and so incapacitates oneself for form work . the authorities begin to make awkward investigations , mr spence . who looked after the school 's efforts to win medals at aldershot .
it is said that when a pupil leaves the gymnasium . he not only has a comprehensive education , but he knows what he knows . it is not befogged with uncertainty , it is burnt into him so that it will stay . for instance , he does not merely read and write greek . but speaks it ; the same with the latin , foreign youth steer clear of the gymnasium .
all in short was confusion , oaths , and bawling . and there would have been no end to the uproar if the lieutenant corregidor had not just then entered the room . having heard the noise as he was going his rounds . he asked what it was all about , and the landlady replied with great copiousness of detail . she told him who was the damsel colindres ( who by this time had got her clothes on ) .
mrs. [female] asked mr. [male] which were the clevelands . mr. [male] said very quietly that the clevelands were not playing today . just [location] and [location] and that only two teams could play the game at the same time . that perhaps next year they would have it so that cleveland and [location] could both play [location] at once but the rules would have to be changed first . mrs. [male] said that he did not have to be so nasty about is .
we did not purchase any `` relics , '' and as to the roman `` weather , '' no mortal who tries it in summer desires a second dose . there seemed to be a continuous smell of something dead in the atmosphere of rome . while the droves of virgins , monks , priests . bishops and cardinals seemed to be pressing through the streets .
the bell on the door of the outer shop tinkled at the entrance of a customer . ah yen rose with that air of quiet resignation that habitually marked his demeanour . and remained for some time in the shop , when he returned he seemed in no mood to continue speaking of his lost friend . i left him soon after and walked sorrowfully home to my lodgings . on my way i mused much upon my little eastern friend and the sympathetic grasp of his imagination .
for a few minutes [female] , drifting slowly down , enjoyed the romance of her situation to the full . then something happened not at all romantic , the flat began to leak , in a very few moments it was necessary for elaine to scramble to her feet . pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall of blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her barge through which the water was literally pouring . that sharp stake at the landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat . [female] did not know this , but it did not take her long to realize that she was in a dangerous plight .
a challenge from fitzgibbon was the consequence of this sally . and the parties having met , were to fire when they chose , `` i never , '' said curran , when relating the circumstances of the duel , i never saw any one whose determination seemed more malignant than fitzgibbon 's . after i had fired , he took aim at me for at least half a minute .
[female] turned away , whistling between his teeth , after a moment 's pause . adair rode off , [male] saw his light pass across the field and through the gate . the school clock struck the quarter . it seemed to [male] that sergeant collard . even if he had started to wait for him at the house .
one by one the dishes were inserted in the oven , and one by one their owners retired . a feeling of greater confidence in their hearts now that they could prepare a proper dinner . the men went off to get a drink , and soon [female] was alone . during the first half hour mrs. [female] paid three separate visits to the field kitchen . to her it was a new and puzzling contrivance , and she had no means of gauging the heat of the oven .
which she appreciated , because of course they were not monks at all . she had a lightning impression that they were especially fond of kieth . the father rector had called him `` kieth '' and one of the others had kept a hand on his shoulder all through the conversation . then she was shaking hands again and promising to come back a little later for some ice-cream . and smiling and smiling and being rather absurdly happy , , , she told herself that it was because kieth was so delighted in showing her off .
`` a very pretty workman , '' said gideon , rather forgetting himself . she turned and looked at him , with a suspicion of a frown . and the indiscreet young man was glad to direct her attention to the packing case . the bulk of the work had been accomplished ; and presently [female] had burst through the last barrier and disclosed a zone of straw . in a moment they were kneeling side by side .
he chose to do this by delivering a short homily on the advantages of school . by which he might lead [male] to look on the matter in the calm light of reason and common sense . and commonplaces on the subject began to rise to the surface of his mind . from the rather muddy depths to which they had long since sunk . he began to give [male] the benefit of all this stagnant wisdom .
he gulped and tried to make his face look normal . `` all right , '' he said , `` fine , we will go to the palace . '' he tried to ignore the pall of apprehension that fell over the car . therefore , when the entourage of queen [female] i strolled into the main salon . not a single eye was batted , not a single gasp was heard , nevertheless , the staff kept a discreet eye on the crew .
you are overflowing copiously and you wish he would take the time to stop and bail you out . you abhor the idea of being drowned as an inside job . but no , he keeps right on and along about here it is customary for you to swoon away . he pulls her , she does her level best but he pulls her . he harvests small sections of the gum from time to time and occasionally he stops long enough to loosen up the roots as far down as your floating ribs .
for about a week , perhaps a bit more , the recollection of that quiet little domestic evening bucked him up like a tonic . elephants , i read somewhere , are champions at the memory business . but they were fools to bobbie during that week . but , bless you , the shock was not nearly big enough . it had dinted the armour , but it had not made a hole in it .
in this way they went on , and on , and on -- in the language of the story books . until at last the village lights appeared before them . and the church spire cast a long reflection on the graveyard grass . as if it were a dial ( alas , the truest in the world ! ) marking , whatever light shone out of heaven .
people were talking about him , local opinion had decided that he had behaved badly . already one man had cut him , [organization] blenched at a sudden vision of street fulls of men . long piccadillys of men , all cutting him . one after the other , something had got to be done , he was devoted to derek . this sort of thing was as bad as being cut himself .
at twelve o'clock the next morning i met mr. [male] by appointment in the burlington arcade . we strolled slowly round into bond street . mr. [male] was , for him , unusually serious , he looked about him all the time with swift , careful glances . as we turned into bond street his pace became slower and slower . within a yard or two of the spot where i had first seen him disappear he paused .
it was , of course , quite out of the question . mr. [male] , as soon as he had read the letter . felt that it was so , had things been smooth and easy with him . nothing would have delighted him more , his liking for the lad was most sincere . and it would have been a real pleasure to him to have worked with him during the holidays .
she settled down to type the letters smith had indicated , she attacked her task cautiously . she was one of those typists who are at their best when they do not have to hurry . she was putting the finishing touches to the last of the batch . when there was a shuffling of feet in the outer room . followed by a knock on the door , the next moment there entered a short .
chapter v -- an apology for all heroes who have good stomachs . with a description of a battle of the amorous kind . chapter vii -- containing a fuller account of mrs waters . and by what means she came into that distressful situation from which she was rescued by [female] . chapter i -- containing instructions very necessary to be perused by modern critics .
he did , so we started , mine not to reason why . mine but to do and die , as the poem says , if an elephant had come into geisenheimer 's and asked me to dance i would have had to do it . and i am not saying that mr ferris was not the next thing to it . he was one of those earnest , persevering dancers -- the kind that have taken twelve correspondence lessons . i guess i was about due that night to meet someone from the country .
but in one respect they all agreed , that government must have had some interested view . in giving such positive orders to preserve it , and keep it from the natives of the country . petitions were addressed to me from all quarters . from every corporation and body of men in the whole empire . the majority of the people instructed their constituents .
some of the statutes you see that did not look so big as josiah . when you come clost up to `` em you found wuz sixteen feet high , and [organization] '' the shell of holy water at the entrance you see are six feet high . you look fur down the meetin' house as you look down the road into a big piece of woods . only here the distant trees turn into statutes and shrines and altars and things .
the man with the black beard , to gain some private end . had tied this young woman with ropes to a complicated system of machinery . mostly wheels and pulleys , the man with the yellow beard was in the act of pushing or pulling a lever . the beardless man , protruding through a trapdoor in the floor . was pointing a large revolver at the parties of the second part .
[female] told a sad history , as we walked . about a man he once knew , who is now in a home for harmless imbeciles . he said he recalled the story because it was on just such another night as this that he was walking with that man the very last time he ever saw the poor fellow . they were strolling down the thames embankment , [male] said . and the man frightened him then by persisting that he saw the statue of the duke of [location] at the corner of westminster bridge .
yet this is nothing near the worst sort , and is naught else but a kind of a scabbiness that the most accomplishedst marriages are infected with . and verily if the husbands do thus neglect their times , and their wives . in the meanwhile , like carefull bees . are diligent in looking after their shop and housekeeping ; they ought . when they do come home to speak their minds somthing freely to them .
in the wild , unfettered west , beware of the man who never carries arms . never gets drunk and always minds his own business , he do not go around shooting out the gas . or intimidating a kindergarten school ; but when a brave frontiersman . with a revolver in each boot and a bowie down the back of his neck . insults a modest young lady , and needs to be thrown through a plate glass window and then walked over by the populace .
why , what kind of a man do you take me for ! then , oh , rex , love me and be nice to me and . and take me away from all this , i have often tried to thank you and good old [male] for letting me come over here so much , but now ! how can i ever thank you ? see what i mean ? i will tell you how . behave yourself after you are married to [male] 's little sister .
but the one thing that nobody is allowed to do in mariposa is to have no politics . of course there are always some people whose circumstances compel them to say that they have no politics . but that is easily understood , take the case of trelawney , the postmaster . long ago he was a letter carrier under the old mackenzie government . and later he was a letter sorter under the old macdonald government .
since then , no other english dude part having happened along , he had rested . living in the mysterious way in which out of work actors do live . he had a number of acquaintances . such as the amiable burrows , who were good for occasional loans , but [male] was the king of them all . there was something princely about the careless open handedness of [organization] 's methods .
if somebody says : `` a rickety cradle may mean a rickety baby , '' the natural deduction , one would think , would be to give the people a good cradle . or give them money enough to buy one . but that means higher wages and greater equalisation of wealth . and the plutocratic scientist , with a slightly troubled expression , turns his eyes and pince nez in another direction .
between gombauld and mr. [male] a very much lowered deck chair presented its back to the new arrivals as they advanced towards the tea table . gombauld was leaning over it ; his face moved vivaciously . he smiled , he laughed , he made quick gestures with his hands . from the depths of the chair came up a sound of soft , lazy laughter . [male] started as he heard it .
i have mentioned that kernin is a lawyer . and [male] a railroad man and [male] a banker . but i need not have , any reader would take it for granted , in any fishing party there is always a lawyer . you can tell him at sight . he is the one of the party that has a landing net and a steel rod in sections with a wheel that is used to wind the fish to the top of the water .
after a while she pronounced them `` affreux . '' her brother remarked that it was apparently a country in which the foreground was inferior to the plans recules . and the baroness rejoined that the landscape seemed to be all foreground . [male] had fixed with his new friends the hour at which he should bring his sister . it was four o'clock in the afternoon .
person 's log , sunday , june 3 . latitude 17 degrees 54 minutes . heavy sea all night , and from four a.m. very wet , the sea breaking over [location] in frequent sluices . and soaking everything aft , particularly , all day the sea has been very high . and it is a wonder that we are not swamped .
was it an angel 's voice , not altogether . it was [male] 's , the boy was leaning out of a window some six feet higher up the castle wall . [male] , his eyes by now grown used to the darkness . perceived that the stripling gesticulated as one having some message to impart , then , glancing to one side . he saw what looked like some kind of a rope swayed against the wall .
`` i am vastly obliged to you , '' said paul . and he meant it , it was a new experience to find anyone offering him assistance . he left the close little shop , crossed the road . and started off in the direction indicated to him at a brisk trot . his steps rang out cheerfully on the path ironbound with frost .
at present he is engaged in promoting and writing a little life insurance on the side . now her equipage is lost in the throng and the great actor continues on his way . making a mental note of the fact that he has promised to attend her next sunday afternoon studio tea . near his own stage door he bumps into commodious rotunda . the stout comedian of the comic theater .
it was in 1782 that this grand work was finally completed , and the happy owners gloated with delight over a monument of skill as matchless in its way as the pyramids themselves . but , alas , the necklace might as well have been constructed of the common boulders piled in those same pyramids as of the finest jewels of the mine . for all the good it seemed destined to bring the poor jewelers , beyond the rapture of beholding it and calling it theirs . the necklace was worth 1,500,000 francs , equivalent to more than dollar 300,000 in gold . as money then went , or nearly dollar 500,000 in gold , now a days .
it happened that no other member of the family was at home . ill health had banished every one , even the secretary , flowers , telegrams . and congratulations came , and a string of callers . he saw no one but a few intimate friends . we were entirely alone for dinner , and i felt the great honor of being his only guest on such an occasion .
we were to start at noon , the impatient crowd which pressed around the enclosed space . filling the enclosed square , overflowing into the contiguous streets , and covering the houses from the ground floor to the slated gables . presented a striking scene , the high winds of the preceding days had subsided . an oppressive heat fell from the cloudless sky . scarcely a breath animated the atmosphere , in such weather .
i am prepared to assert that if a thing with flashing green eyes , and clammy hands . and long , dripping strips of sea weed in place of hair . should rise up out of the floor before me at this moment . two a.m. , and nobody in the house but myself . with a fearful , nerve destroying storm raging outside , i should without hesitation ask it to sit down and light a cigar and state its business .
tesman and mrs. elvsted have risen from the table in the back room . and come into the drawing room , if you like , [ quickly , ] no , wait ! let me clear it first , oh , you need not trouble , hedda . there is plenty of room , no no , let me clear it , i say ! i will take these things in and put them on the piano , there !
he assented , but her remark had only an aesthetic value . he was not prepared to take it to his heart . all the afternoon he rested -- worried , but not exactly despondent . the thing would jog out somehow , probably miss abbott was right , the baby had better stop where it was loved . and that , probably , was what the fates had decreed , he felt little interest in the matter .
and then this estimable man shook hands with me in action the most cordial . i walked away from old change as if i trod upon air . a feeling vastly different from that with which i departed from the residence of the old nobleman in the west end but a few hours before . next morning i was in [location] . and next night i attended the underground meeting of the anarchists .
he reads , but he can not speak , spanish , he can not abide ginger beer . ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish . how pleasant to know mr. lear , the history of lear 's choice of a career was a curious one . he was the youngest of twenty one children , and , through a family mischance . was thrown entirely on the limited resources of an elderly sister at a very early age .
mr pecksniff also was in the room , and [male] . in the swift instant of their mutual recognition , [male] saw the old man droop his grey head . and hide his face in his hands , it smote him to the heart . in his most selfish and most careless day , this lingering remnant of the old man 's ancient love . this buttress of a ruined tower he had built up in the time gone by .
he woke up , turned over , saw the new moon on the window . wondered a little , and went to sleep again , there was some little delay in getting mr. [male] 's breakfast . so that after all he was not free to start out of guildford until just upon the stroke of nine . he wheeled his machine from the high street in some perplexity . he did not know whether this young lady , who had seized hold of his imagination so strongly .
`` bless me , '' he said , withdrawing his head . unconscious that there was a black smudge on the right episcopal cheek . it will take a dreadful lot of fuel . now , who will volunteer to stoke ? turning his most persuasive smile upon the group of men . who had been keenly interested in his examination of the contrivance , the men shuffled their feet .
mrs. [female] ( surprised , but not in the least incredulous ) -- i could not go so far as to say i knew it . [female] -- i can explain everything , my dear . the doctor 's all wrong , the whole trouble is somebody pulled the roof off the other day and stabbed me with a poisoned sword . i was right here in this room , i was just quietly reading the evening post . i knew no good would come of our moving into this new apartment house , with its fancy wire and green paint and free food .
he had now become ruined , partly in consequence of foolish speculations jointly with [male] . believed to be conducted under divine guidance , and partly because his strange conduct destroyed his business reputation and standing . the death of [male] , and some very queer matters about another apparent poisoning trick . awakened the suspicions of the folgers ; and after a good deal of scolding and trouble with the impostor . who hung on to his comfortable home like a good fellow , [male] finally turned him out .
one morning , in a continental city , i came across a disturbance . it might be more correct to say the disturbance came across me . it swept down upon me , enveloped me before i knew that i was in it . a fox terrier it was , belonging to a very young lady -- it was when the disturbance was to a certain extent over that we discovered he belonged to this young lady . she arrived towards the end of the disturbance .
the rooms filled rapidly , enid , after one languid waltz . disappeared with [male] and was not seen again till supper , amelie flew from partner to partner . pouring streams of vivacious talk into patient masculine ears . the twins were dutifully taken out in turn and unfailingly brought back , both mr. [male] and mr. [male] came . serious young men who danced little , and looked on more as if the affair were a problem in sociology than an entertainment .
`` den ve are ruint , '' cried [male] . displaying his palms , and showing by that act a select assortment of diamond rings . `` by this , '' said the stranger , holding up the tiny stub end of a cigar . `` i will tell you , '' said the stranger , and he at once proceeded as follows . the company drew closer together and formed themselves in a more compact mass about the speaker .
but in 200 years time it is more than probable that that dog will be dug up from somewhere or other . minus its legs , and with its tail broken . and will be sold for old [location] , and put in a glass cabinet . and people will pass it round , and admire it . they will be struck by the wonderful depth of the colour on the nose .
it was not like his father , but it surely looked so . his father was a rather tough nut , in truth . but had never been so with his son -- still , this implacable silence had a calamitous look . anyway , tracy would go to the towers and -- then what ? he did not know . his head was tired out with thinking -- he would not think about what he must do or say .
`` i am sure davey will find homes for them , '' mom says soothingly , but getting a little short of breath , the way she does any time she 's afraid one of [location] is losing his temper . in fact , one thing this cat business seems to have established is that me and pop fighting is the main cause of mom 's asthma . so we both try to do a little better , and a lot of things we used to argue and fight about . like my jazz records , we just kid each other about now .
so , instead of using up words , he went and cashed in the chips . for once , he realized , the government had made money on an investment . it was probably the first time since 1775 , the crowd . it seemed , would not let them go , [female] never found out . then or later , how the news of her majesty 's winnings had gone through the place so fast .
but his discourse and deportment destroyed all the impressions which his writings had made in his favour . he took upon him to decide dogmatically upon every subject . without deigning to shew the least cause for his differing from the general opinions of mankind . as if it had been our duty to acquiesce in the ipse dixit of this new pythagoras . he rejudged the characters of all the principal authors .
of course , i might have gone over to h. 3rd and , after a short struggle . taken the carving knife away from him by main force , but that would have made him mad . he would at length have suppressed his anger and right away a complex would begin in his little square head . picture him now at thirty . he has [male] , somebody mentions the theory of blind abscesses and he has all his teeth pulled out .
i got that watch your father sent me for a new years present . tell him thanks very much an not to feel bad because he forgot to send me a christmas present cause this wipes out the debt entirely . he said it was a military watch an the latest thing out . i guess they call it a military watch cause it works two hours and stops four . its the latest thing round here , if i answered call by that watch id be fallin in for retreat round taps .
`` luckily , '' i said , `` i am able to arrange that , i happen to have money with me. '' and i took two sovereigns from my pocket , person was delighted at our good luck . our preparations for the experiment were soon made , we placed the table in the middle of the room in such a way that there could be no fear of contact or collision with any of the furniture . the chairs were carefully set against the wall , and so placed that no two of them occupied the same place as any other two . while the pictures and ornaments about the room were left entirely undisturbed .
for several minutes they watched , they saw mrs. [female] lay aside the monkey on a stick . and bend over the babe , murmuring the sounds that come by instinct to every woman 's lips . at a sign from [female] , they entered . mrs. [female] glanced over her shoulder in their direction . but other and weightier matters claimed her attention , [male] ,
since this calamity , wrote strachan , everything had gone wrong . the m.c.c. , led by [male] 's brother [male] . the least of the three first class cricketing jacksons , had smashed them by a hundred and fifty runs . [male] had wiped them off the face of the earth . the incogs , with a team recruited exclusively from the rabbit hutch .
evolution , popularly speaking , is that which happens to unconscious things . they grow unconsciously ; or fade unconsciously ; or rather , some parts of them grow and some parts of them fade . and at any given moment there is almost always some presence of thc fading thing . and some incompleteness in the growing one , thus , if i went to sleep for a hundred years . like the sleeping beauty , i should grow a beard .
he threaded his way through a maze of boats . ropes , and curious shaped steel structures which the architect of the ship seemed to have tacked on at the last moment in a spirit of sheer exuberance . above him towered one of the funnels , before him a long , slender mast . he hurried on , and presently came upon billie sitting on a garden seat . backed by the white roof of the smoke room ; beside this was a small deck which seemed to have lost its way and strayed up here all by itself .
all the while he was dreading the moment when he would be alone with his wife and she would patiently expect him to be ardent . with his wife , since it was inconceivable to explain that he was going to seek paul 's spirit in the wilderness . he frugally employed the lie prepared over a year ago and scarcely used at all . he said that he had to see a man in [location] on business . he could not have explained even to himself why he drew from the bank several hundred dollar more than he needed .
of the characters whom our readers are to imagine seated on the deck . on one of the many decks -- of the gloritania , one word may be said . vere [male] lancy is ( as the reviewers have under oath declared ) . a typical young englishman of the upper class , he is nephew to the duke of . but of this fact no one on the ship .
these know that dame nature hath placed her best features in a city maid . as well as in a lady at court : and that there are no keener swords . or stronger steels to penetrate through the hearts of men . then the handsom bodiedness , comly and kind behaviour of women . this is oftentimes the occasion that the son hath more inclination towards her .
did you ever hear the story ? i expect not . well , then , you must hear it , but there will be too many inverted commas in it if i let hyacinth tell you . so i shall tell you myself , it was just after he became king . he was so proud that he used to go about saying , i am the king . i am the king , '' and sometimes , `` the king am i .
from the mothers i turned my admiring eyes towards the children . this is the secret of [location] success . said i to myself ; this high spirited courage . this spartan contempt for suffering , look at them ! the gallant little men and women , who would think that they had lost a father ?
plunging into a hasty marriage in order to escape from a foolish entanglement is like rushing under a trolley car in order to escape from a taxicab . nowadays a girl 's favorite way of committing suicide for love of a man . is to marry him and worry herself to death over him . a good wife is always her husband 's guide , philosopher and friend ', . also his guardian , digestion , conscience , time table and valet .
[male] took the steam engine . then there were eight , eight christmas presents -- and one came from devon . robbie took the jackknife , then there were seven , seven christmas presents direct fromnick 's . [male] took the candy box . then there were six , six christmas presents , one of them alive .
) no one was present except the old family lawyer . who was moved to tears at the sight of the bright , trusting bride . and the clergyman who wept at the sight of the cheque given him by the viscount . after the ceremony the old trustee took lord and lady radnor to a small wedding breakfast at an hotel . during the breakfast a sudden faintness ( for which we had been watching for ten pages ) , overcame him .
during her young woman and goodlooking days hood b. is said to have made a hit with european nobility . in her declining years she made a few other fortunes in [location] , b . 's fame culminated in having several cigars , perfumes , perspiration powders . and a theatre named after her , ambition : the fountain of youth . recreation : statuary , acting , address : private cars and 56 blvd .
he walked many miles , sometimes he arose in the air . with ease and grace , and flew a few miles . finally he found the vat of benzine . immersed himself in it , and began to dissolve calmly and with a blessed sense of having done his duty . it was then that philo gubb entered the dreamless sleep of the utterly weary .
she did not say all this without a motive , she knew that a local historical pageant was being arranged for the coming summer . and that lady harriet was on the committee , also she had heard that . after rehearsals had begun , some of the principal performers had resigned their parts . and the committee had some difficulty in finding substitutes . it had struck her as not at all unlikely that her visitor had called with a view to ascertaining whether the services of any of the stimpson household would be available .
it is hard to astonish the waiters at a [location] restaurant . but when the cat performed this feat there was a squeal of surprise all round the room . waiters rushed to and fro , futile but energetic , the cat . having secured a strong strategic position on the top of a large oil painting which hung on the far wall . was expressing loud disapproval of the efforts of one of the waiters to drive it from its post with a walking stick .
i do not know , nor do i give a whoop , but this i know . if she is so inclined she can come play with me on our back stoop . even in office hours , i do not mind . in fact i know i am nice and good and ready to get an option on her as my steady . i sometimes think that i am not so good , that there are foxier , warmer babes than i .
in the fourth act , longinus , who made such a prosperous and enviable start in the first act . is left alone in the desert , sick , blind , helpless , incredibly old . to die : not a friend left in the world . another ruined life , and in that act , also , appelles worshipped boy . nymphas , done to death by the mob , breathes out his last sigh in his father 's arms .
he turned suddenly to mrs. [female] , in his heart there was an uncharitable hope that she too might be caught in the toils from which he had just escaped . but mrs. [female] ate like a book on etiquette . she held her knife and fork at the extreme end of the handles . her elbows pressed well into her sides , and literally toyed with her food . after each mouthful , she raised her napkin to her lips .
if angela 's shark had bitten me in the leg . i could not have leaped more convulsively , so tensely had i been concentrating on gussie 's interests that it had not so much as crossed my mind that another and an unfortunate construction could be placed on those words of mine . the persp. , already bedewing my brow , became a regular niagara . she was carrying on with her remarks , and as i listened i clenched my fists till i should not wonder if the knuckles did not stand out white under the strain . it seemed as if she would never get to the nub .
here comes a hiatus , i am told that i was seen dancing . was observed to eat an excellent supper , and was noticed in the smoking room with a cigarette in my mouth . at last the first of my two waltzes , the [female] boating song . one of my favourites , i threaded my way through the room in search of her . she was in neither of the doorways , i cast my eyes about the room .
at any rate , if he can not write , he has mastered a number of other accomplishments wonderful for one of his age and size . he is one of the best shots and riders in england . he rode his horse abracadabra . and won the famous guttlebury steeple chase , he has horses entered at half the races in the country ( under other people 's names . for the old lord is a strict hand , and will not hear of betting or gambling ) .
may had passed , and june roses were in late bloom . the city was horrid with the warm sun filtered air after a summer shower . and [male] looked pale and languid as he stepped from an elevator . in one of the great department houses wherein ferrars had his bachelor quarters . and walked slowly to his door , possibly it was the warmth of a very warm june .
i tried to look my situation fairly in the face . whatever reason and common sense had to say about it . there seemed no possible doubt that something of a supernatural order was shut up in that great chamber down the corridor . and also that , if i meant to win chlorine , i must go up and have some kind of an interview with it . once more i wished i had some definite idea to go upon ; what description of being should i find this curse ?
and then a sort of a lurid , wild looking chap , a minister . got up and preached the wildest and luridest discourse i ever hearn in my hull days . it wuz enough to scare a snipe , the very strongest and toughest men there turned pale . and wimmen cried and wept on every side of me . and wept and cried , my josiah would have to stand outside and let me go down under the dark .
he was president of the stock board . and occupied the siege perilous , which he had bought of sir [male] . for the stock board consisted of the knights of the round table . and they used the round table for business purposes now . seats at it were worth -- well , you would never believe the figure .
the very mildness of his tone showed how worried the man was . [male] realized , and he set out for the first hospital on his own list with grim determination written all over his face and a heartbeat that seemed to hammer at him that his country expected every man to do his duty . `` i find my duty hard to do today , '' he murmured under his breath . it was all right to tell himself that he had to find a telepath . but how did you go about it ? did you just knock on hospital doors and ask them if they had anybody who could read minds ?
in short , we deal with heredity as we deal with omens . affinities and the fulfillment of dreams . the things do happen , and when they happen we record them . but not even a lunatic ever reckons on them , indeed , heredity , like dreams and omens . is a barbaric notion ; that is , not necessarily an untrue , but a dim .
the method of the preliminary puff and the subsequent official confirmation is decidedly a mistake in the case of the character portrayed by mrs. [female] in mis nelly , of n'orleans , mrs. [female] showed herself quite capable of carrying the role of a spirited . romantic and adventurous belle , and it was unnecessary to have her triumph so carefully prepared in advance by the predictions of her servants as to what she would do when she `` got her jim crow up . '' we might have been content to accept some of the other characters as sure enough romantic figures if they had not been so confoundedly confident that they were . they fairly challenged [location] into disbelief .
armed with this he set forth and rang the bell of no . 233 king 's road , the private residence of [male] . he had met the lawyer at a time of great public excitement in chelsea . [male] , who had a sense of humour and a great deal of careless kindness in his nature . followed the acquaintance up , and , having come to laugh , remained to drop into a contemptuous kind of friendship .
to violently reform and cast away the weed and at the end of a week to find a good cigar unexpectedly in the quiet . unostentatious pocket of an old vest , affords the most intense and delirious delight . scientists tell [location] that a single drop of the concentrated oil of tobacco on the tongue of an adult dog is fatal . i have no doubt about the truth or cohesive power of this statement . and for that reason i have always been opposed to the use of tobacco among dogs .
[female] , he considered , in leaning out of the window and saying `` psst ! '' was merely touching the fringe of the subject , it is probable that he would have remained seated on the balcony rail regarding the sheet with cold aversion . indefinitely , had not his hand been forced by the man plummer . plummer , during these last minutes , had shot his bolt . he had said everything that a man could say .
a yell rang out , [female] 's theory had been tested and proved correct . by this time the affair had begun to attract spectators . the noise of the revolver had proved a fine advertisement . the roof of the house next door began to fill up . only a few of the occupants could get a clear view of the proceedings .
the milkman waters milk for me . there 's garlic in my butter , but i am only a consumer . and it does no good to mutter ; i know that coal is going up and beef is getting higher . but i am only a consumer , and i have no need of fire . while beefsteak is a luxury that wealth alone is needing .
mr. [male] rather felt that they had gone under . they had given up their attempt -- if it was one . to conquer society , and now the father was almost as silent as the son . he wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left . some expedition , perhaps , with [male] well chaperoned to be nice to them .
cain , one of our ancestors of whom we do not brag . canute , a king of england who proved the theory that the ocean could wave at him . carmen , celebrated spanish flirt , she worked in the government tobacco factory at [organization] until a clever writer and a musician rescued her . went on the stage , has appeared in most of the cities throughout the world . made love to several singers , and then been killed by a bull fighter after singing her way through five acts .
i will ask you to go back with me to the year 1821 . it seemed that he might have been in the moon for all that we could do to help him . but that was only because we were all soldiers and knew nothing of the sea . of course , we had our own little troubles to make [location] bitter . as well as the wrongs of our emperor , there were many of [location] who had held high rank and would hold it again if he came back to his own .
[female] read the thing through in its entirety three times before he appreciated a nuance which his disordered mind had at first failed to grasp . to wit , that this character sketch of himself was no mere isolated outburst but apparently one of a series . in several places the writer alluded unmistakeably to other theses on the same subject . [male] 's breakfast congealed on its tray , untouched . that [male] which the gods so seldom bestow .
he goes on to say he is expecting to hear from the gentleman almost any minute now and then he will know better what the program is . almost before he gets the words out of his mouth the telephone bell rings and sure enough . it is this here mr. [male] which is on the wire . and it turns out that the place where we are going is ready for [location] now on account of the folks which owns it having gone away sooner than what they expected . and the further tidings is that we can move up there that same day .
the next morning , the philosopher commanded the throng to remove the pile of stones . and as they did so , a dog was discovered instead of the beggar . the dog sprang up , wagged his tail , and made away at `` two forty '' and with him the pestilence departed . for this feat , the ephesians called [male] a god . and reared a statue to his honor , the appellation of divinity he willingly accepted .
my friends are failing me , they wo not sit up after midnight . they have taken to sleeping out of doors , on porches and pergolas . some , i understand , merely roost on plain wooden bars , they rise early . they take deep breathing , they bathe in ice water . they are no good , this change i am sure , is excellent , it is .
i tried to buy a diploma for an invalid friend at home who had never traveled . and whose desire all his life has been to ascend mont blanc . but the guide in chief rather insolently refused to sell me one , i was very much offended . i said i did not propose to be discriminated against on the account of my nationality . that he had just sold a diploma to this german gentleman .
yes , it had been a wonderful afternoon , but trouble was waiting for her in sixth avenue . trouble was never absent for very long from katie 's unselfish life . arriving at the little bookshop , she found mr murdoch , the glazier . preparing for departure , mr murdoch came in on mondays . wednesdays , and fridays to play draughts with her grandfather .
at this point speech failed mr. [male] . for , even as he began the sentence , the door that led to the bathroom opened and gerald foster came out . mr. [male] gaped at gerald : gerald gaped at mr. [male] . the application of cold water to the face and head is an excellent thing on the morning after an imprudent night . but as a tonic it only goes part of the way .
in the mining display is a model of one of their copper mines . and you see they have the largest furnace in the world . and they not only mine on land but under the sea . it beats all how them japanese do go ahead , there are tall gold and silver bars showing how much they have mined in these metals . their educational exhibit shows the same wonderful energy and advancement .
they must have thus examined forty people , and still there was no word of [male] . but now the course of their search brought them near the centre of the collision . where the boilers were still blowing off steam with a deafening clamour . it was a part of the field not yet gleaned by the rescuing party . the ground , especially on the margin of the wood .
just waited till he got outside an thumbed my nose at him , high spirited . thats me all over , an english officer came over the other day an told [location] all about the war . he didnt quite finish it cause he only had three quarters of an hour . they was quite a few things i didnt kno even at that , he said that the heavy artillery was commanded by the c.c.o.d.a . an the light artillery by the c.o.a , an theres a special n.c.o .
the window came up with a jerk , patty , patty ! ', shrieked priscilla . patty turned and waved her hand airily , ca not stop now -- will be back in a moment ', . and she sped on around the corner , the two stood watching the house for several minutes . vaguely expecting an explosion of some sort to occur , but nothing happened . patty was swallowed as if by the grave , and the house gave no sign .
public abuses are so prominent and pestilent that they sweep all generous people into a sort of fictitious unanimity . we forget that , while we agree about the abuses of things . we should differ very much about the uses of them . mr. [male] and i would agree about the bad public house . it would be precisely in front of the good public house that our painful personal fracas would occur .
in the celibacy of the clergy , we may discover also the origin of nunneries . the intrigues they could procure , while at confession . were only short , occasional , and with women whom they could not entirely appropriate to themselves . to remedy which , they probably fabricated the scheme of having religious houses . where young women should be shut up from the world , and where no man but a priest .
yet they are practical in some parliamentary matters , for instance . there is a committee of rules , presided over by the [male] . which meets to decide what time the house shall devote to each question . say two hours -- one for the democrats and one for the republicans . each [male] in the debate is allowed five minutes .
i said nothing , but i clasped his hand . and then , taking my clubs , i retired , when i looked round she was still in his arms . i left them there , alone together in the great silence . the oldest member has not played golf since the rubber cored ball superseded the old dignified gutty . but as a spectator and philosopher he still finds pleasure in the pastime .
three countrymen were pursuing a wiltshire thief through brentford . the simplest of them seeing `` the wiltshire house , '' written under a sign , advised his companions to enter it . for there most probably they would find their countryman , the second , who was wiser . laughed at this simplicity ; but the third , who was wiser still , answered , let [location] go in .
things went badly for seymour 's , never in the history of the house . or , at any rate , in the comparatively recent history of the house . had there been such a slump in athletic trophies , to begin with , they were soundly beaten in the semi final for the house football cup by allardyce 's lot . with drummond away , there was none to mark the [male] of the school team at half . and allardyce had raced through in a manner that must have compensated him to a certain extent for the poor time he had had in first fifteen matches .
he -- yes , it is he . for what woman would own to a number ten foot even for the sake of a bargain ? saw a fire sale advertised , with men 's shoes offered at a dollar a pair . he went to the store , sure enough , a fire had occurred somewhere . but not there , it was sufficiently near , however , for a fire sale .
banging and slamming of shutters . smashing of windows and the ringing clash of falling glass . clatter of flying feet along the halls . shrieks , supplications , dumb moanings of despair . within , hoarse shouts of command outside ; cracklings and mappings .
this seemed to strike the erring teddy , if not as reasonable , at any rate as one way of looking at it . he delivered the speech in an injured tone and shuffled off . the atmosphere of tenseness was unmistakable now , [male] could feel it . the world of the theatre is simply a large nursery and its inhabitants children who readily become fretful if anything goes wrong . the waiting and the uncertainty , the loafing about in strange hotels in a strange city .
the [location] colony had a regular constitution . said to have been the first written constitution ever adopted by the people , framed for the people by the people . it was at once prosperous , and soon bought out the saybrook colony . in 1662 a royal charter was obtained which united the two above [location] and guaranteed to the people the rights agreed upon by them . it amounted to a duly authenticated independence , a quarter of a century afterwards governor andros .
he was , in fact , sensitive about it . this meeting with the lady was by chance . and , although it afforded exquisite moments , his heart was beating in an unaccustomed manner . and he was suffering from embarrassment , being at a loss . also , for subjects of conversation , it is .
he could not go and tell mrs. [female] that he loved her . and certainly would not have strength to tell her that he did not love her while suffering such agony as this . of course he must see his wife . of course he must , -- if i may use the slang phrase . of course he must `` have it out with her , ''
through the opening the dog aida . rejoicing in the removal of the obstacle , raced like a fur muff mysteriously endowed with legs and a tongue . she tore across the room to where gentleman [female] 's ankles waited invitingly . ever since their first meeting she had wanted a fair chance at those ankles . but some one had always prevented her , the word was drowned in one vast cataclysm of noise .
he spent part of the afternoon in throwing stones at a scarecrow . his aim was fairly good , and he succeeded in knocking off the hat and finally prostrating the wooden framework . followed -- an exciting chase by an angry farmer , it was after tea time when he returned home . walking with careless bravado as of a criminal who has drunk of crime to its very depth and flaunts it before the world . his spirits sank a little as he approached the gate .
you can pick out a public school man in any of the many companies into which they stray . from a chinese opium den to a german jewish dinner party . but i doubt if you could tell which little match girl had been brought up by undenominational religion and which by secular education . the great english aristocracy which has ruled [location] since the reformation is really . in this sense , a model to the moderns .
it must not be assumed from this little reminiscence of this first lady in the land that her marriage was an unhappy one . i think , that as a matter of fact . it was quite the contrary , for subsequent to the wedding each was too busy with other matters to get thinking either morbidly or otherwise on the subject of their individual happiness . they took it as a matter of course . and in the division of labor which the social conditions of the day involved .
on the walls were suspended various pictures , engravings , fencing foils . and masks , boxing gloves , antique models . indian ornaments , plaster casts of legs . arms , hands , feet , and [male] on either side of the table were two chairs . placed there , evidently , in anticipation of the arrival of his friends .
marriott vanished , and [female] , slightly dazed , went about his professional duties once more . [location] walked out into the grounds in search of [location] . [location] was the head of leicester 's this term . vice reynolds departed , and [location] . who was second man up , shared a study with him .
sometimes one is given `` vistas , '' doors stand open , and you can see right away through `` the nook '' into the garden , there is never a living soul about the place . the whole family has been sent out for a walk or locked up in the cellars . this strikes you as odd until you come to think the matter out . the modern man and woman is not artistic , i am not artistic -- not what i call really artistic .
what we need is a name that shall declare , not that the modern treason and tyranny are bad . but that they are quite literally , intolerable : and that we mean to act accordingly . i really think `` the limits '' would be as good a name as any . but , anyhow , something is born among [location] that is as strong as an infant hercules . and it is part of my prejudices to want it christened .
she put forward the lame excuse that she had not dined . kirk gave her the sherry and sandwich and resumed his patrol in a glow of indignation . the idea of any one requiring food at this moment struck him as gross and revolting . his wrath did not last , in a short while fear came back into its own . the hands of the clock pointed to ten before he stooped to following mrs. [male] 's example .
finally i told her in my best german , meantime accompanying myself with appropriate yet graceful gestures . that she need not concern herself further with the affair . she could just let the matter drop and i would interview the manager and put in a claim for the value of the lost garment . she looked at me dazedly a moment while i repeated the injunction more painstakingly than before . and , at that , understanding seemed to break down the barriers of her reason and she said , `` ja , ja ! ''
how proud you were to do her bidding , how delightful it was to be ordered about by her ! to devote your whole life to her and to never think of yourself seemed such a simple thing . you would go without a holiday to lay a humble offering at her shrine . and felt more than repaid if she only deigned to accept it . how precious to you was everything that she had hallowed by her touch .
that was a mistake of large dimensions , the old masters were still unpleasing to me . but they were truly divine contrasted with the copies , the copy is to the original as the pallid . smart , inane new wax work group is to the vigorous , earnest , dignified group of living men and women whom it professes to duplicate . there is a mellow richness , a subdued color , in the old pictures . which is to the eye what muffled and mellowed sound is to the ear .
to make matters worse , a ring at the front door [organization] followed almost immediately . and the maid ushered in a young man of pleasing appearance in a sweater and baggy knickerbockers who apologetically but firmly insisted on playing his ball where it lay . and , what with the shock of the lecturer 's narrow escape and the spectacle of the intruder standing on the table and working away with a niblick . the afternoon 's session had to be classed as a complete frost . mr. [male] 's determination , from which no argument could swerve him .
there is something pathetic in the good man 's horror of this snobbishness . to which he himself was a victim . may it not have been an affectation , born unconsciously of self consciousness ? his heroes and heroines must needs be all fine folk . fit company for lady and gentlemen readers .
his portly middle section , rising beyond like a small hill , heaved rhythmically , his face was covered with a silk handkerchief . from beneath which came , in even succession , faint and comfortable snores . it was a peaceful picture -- the good man taking his rest . and for me it had an added attractiveness in that it suggested that [male] was doing by day what my information had prevented him from doing in the night . it had been some small consolation to me .
it seems to me that we have too much liberty in this country in some ways . we have more liberty than we have money . we guarantee that every man in [location] shall fill himself up full of liberty at our expense . and the less of an [location] he is the more liberty he can have . should he desire to enjoy himself , all he needs is a slight foreign accent and a willingness to mix up with politics as soon as he can get his baggage off the steamer .
the bowling of a house team is all head and no body . the first pair probably have some idea of length and break . the first change pair are poor , and the rest , the small change . are simply the sort of things one sees in dreams after a heavy supper . or when one is out without one 's gun , time , mercifully , generally breaks up a big stand at cricket before the field has suffered too much .
i know that when a lot of young men get off by themselves . some of them think that recklessness with money brands them as good fellows . and that carefulness is meanness , that is the one end of a college education which is pure cussedness . and that is the one thing which makes nine business men out of ten hesitate to send their boys off to school . but on the other hand , that is the spot where a young man has the chance to show that he is not a light weight .
i think my voice is better also that it was either four . eight , twelve or sixteen years ago , and it does not tire me so much to think of things to say from the tail gate of a train as it did when i first began to refrain from presenting my name to conventions . in going down my cellar stairs the committee will do well to avoid stepping on a large and venomous dog who sleeps on the top stair . or i will tie him in the barn if i can be informed when i am liable to be startled . putting on his toga and buckling an old hame strap around his loins he said .
the ausgleich is an adjustment , arrangement , settlement . which holds austria and [location] together , it dates from 1867 . and has to be renewed every ten years , it establishes the share which [location] must pay toward the expenses of the imperial government . [location] is a kingdom ( the emperor of austria is its king ) . and has its own parliament and governmental machinery , but it has no foreign office .
julia 's harmonies in black sapphire were uncalled for . if she really had been as kind as she was too often capable of looking . she would have fastened patches over both eyes . one patch would have been useless -- and she would have worn flat shoes and patronized a dressmaker with genius enough to misrepresent her . but [female] was not great enough for such generosities : she should have been locked up till she passed sixty .
he sighed drowsily , the atmosphere of the auction room was close . you were not allowed to smoke ; and altogether he was beginning to regret that he had come . the service continued , objects of varying unattractiveness came and went , eulogised by the officiating priest . but coldly received by the congregation , relations between the former and the latter were growing more and more distant . the congregation seemed to suspect the priest of having an ulterior motive in his eulogies .
meph , : exactly so , three hours , a little more if anything . by the way , excuse me asking , but have you prepared the subject thoroughly during the term ? smith : well , perhaps , not quite so much as i might have done . such a lot of things to do this term . cricket , for instance , meph . rather .
first of november , -- the earthquake day -- there are traces of age in the one hoss shay . a general flavor of mild decay , but nothing local . as one may say , there could not be , -- for the deacon 's art had made it so like in every part that there was not a chance for one to start . for the wheels were just as strong as the thills , and the floor was just as strong as the sills . and the panels just as strong as the floor , and the whipple tree neither less nor more .
the kitchen garden , one of the longest claws of the abbey , extended to monk 's camp . unfortunately it was , as we have said , early in june . and the kitchen garden , being abandoned , offered no resources , monk had ordered this spot to be guarded . as most subject to surprises , the fires of the enemy 's general were plainly to be perceived on the other side of the abbey . but between these fires and the abbey extended the tweed .
he could remember the time when his father touched his hat to everybody that came into the yard . nevertheless he was dean of brotherton . and so much a dean as to have got the better of all enemies in the close . and his daughter was marchioness of brotherton . she would be [male] to him .
whisky will not make a poet , nor poker a great pleader . and yet i have seen poets who relied solely on the potency of their breath . and lawyers who knew more of the habits of a bob tail flush than they ever did of the statutes in such case made and provided . [male] was always ready , if you wanted a man to be first in war . you could call on [male] , if you desired an adult who would be first baseman in time of peace .
many of [female] 's most powerful speeches were written by himself or at his suggestion . he was a plain , unassuming man . and did not feel above writing his speeches , i have always had the greatest respect and admiration for mr. [male] as a citizen . as a scholar and as an extemporaneous speaker , and had he not allowed his portrait to appear last year in the century . wearing an air of intense gloom and a plug hat entirely out of style .
there are several rooms , some dark and mostly stuffy -- a reception room adorned with horsehair chairs . wool work stools , and a stove that is never lit . german bad taste without german domesticity broods over that room . also a living room , which insensibly glides into a bedroom when the refining influence of hospitality is absent . and real bedrooms ; and last , but not least , the loggia , where you can live day and night if you feel inclined .
it was this sense of bigness that he conveyed . his cleanness , his magnificent fitness , that for the moment overcame mrs. [female] . physical fitness was her gospel , she stared at him in silent appreciation . to the young man , however , her forceful gaze did not convey this quality . she seemed to him to be looking as if she had caught him in the act of endeavouring to snatch her purse .
even as he spoke the words his leg was itching to kick himself for being such a chump . but the sudden expression of pleasure on adeline 's face soothed him . and he went home that night with the feeling that he had taken on something rather attractive . it was only in the cold , grey light of the morning that he realized what he had let himself in for . i do not know if you have had any experience of suburban literary societies .
i would that i had followed his advice always ; i would have saved myself and other people much disaster . i see no reason why it should be , but so it is . if i instruct a man as to the best route between [location] and rome . he loses his luggage in [location] . or is nearly shipwrecked off dover , if i counsel him in the purchase of a camera .
next the music was to be provided ; drawers were emptied ; the shop keepers did a glorious trade in wax . ribbons , and sword knots ; housekeepers laid in stores of bread . meat , and spices , already numbers of the citizens whose houses were furnished as if for a siege . having nothing more to do , donned their festive clothes , and directed their course towards the city gate . in order to be the first to signal or see the cortege , they knew very well that the king would not arrive before night .
p. s. kindly not send a rube . but a real smart man , this brief , but pregnant letter cost some pains in its composition . [male] was not a ready writer , but he completed it at last to his satisfaction . there was a crisp purity in the style that pleased him . he sealed up the envelope , and slipped it into his pocket .
the citizen who avails himself of all modern methods of conveyance will ride from his door on the horse car to the elevated station . where an elevator will elevate him to the train and a revolving platform will swing him on board . or possibly the street car will be lifted from the surface track to the elevated track . and the passenger will retain his seat all the time . then a man will simply hang out a red card , like an express card .
the delighted wilhelminus posted away immediately to his brother , and shewed him the advertisement . robertus congratulated him and sent him in his carriage to take possession of the cottage . after travelling for three days and six nights without stopping , they arrived at the forest and following a track which led by it 's side down a steep hill over which ten rivulets meandered . they reached the cottage in half an hour . wilhelminus alighted , and after knocking for some time without receiving any answer or hearing any one stir within .
and right at this point is where most dry agents have displayed their ignorance of the usages of polite society . for most of them are wofully ignorant of the correct way to handle such a situation . your average dry agent , not being accustomed to the ways of younger marrieds . is often confused upon being unexpectedly kissed , and in his confusion betrays his unfortunate lack of social training . the correct way to meet the above situation is based on the fundamental rule of all social etiquette , common sense .
in the course of that afternoon all the ladies of the family sat for a time with their guest . first came lady [female] and lady susanna , mrs. [female] . who saw very well how the land lay , rather snubbed lady [female] . she had nothing to fear from the dragon of the family . lady [female] , in spite of their cousinship .
madras has more than half a million inhabitants , and it looked well from the steamer . handsome villas , beautiful tropical trees , and hull forests of cactus ablaze with their gorgeous blossoms , it bein sunday whilst on our way from madras to calcutta the [male] read service . and afterwards made his sunday inspection of the crew . the sailors and cooks wuz hindus .
this is peculiarly an age where novelists pride themselves on the breadth of their outlook and the courage with which they refuse to ignore the realities of life . and never before have authors had such scope in the matter of the selection of heroes . in the days of the old-fashioned novel , when the hero was automatically lord blank or sir [male] . there were , of course , certain rules that had to be observed , but today . why , you can hardly hear yourself think for the uproar of earnest young novelists proclaiming how free and unfettered they are .
after sitting three minutes and twenty seconds in solemn silence . it was discovered that [male] was a medium . as he was enabled to bring up the spirits in tangible and unmistaken shape from his closet . and forthwith communications of a very satisfactory character were made to the circle . indeed , the opinion was very generally expressed , that the spirits were genuine spirits .
all that debrett could tell of him was comprised in a few lines . recording simply that he was sixth viscount glencore and loughdooner . born in the month of february , 180 , and married in august , 18 -- . to clarissa isabella , second daughter of sir [male] . of wytchley , baronet ; by whom he had issue .
about ten minutes later , the bell rang for tea . and , as [location] did not come down , mrs. [female] sent up one of the footmen to tell her . after a little time he returned and said that he could not find miss [location] anywhere . as she was in the habit of going out to the garden every evening to get flowers for the dinner table . mrs. [female] was not at all alarmed at first , but when six o'clock struck .
she may have been crazy , [female] realized , but she was a long way from stupid . the project was in full swing , the only trouble was that they were no nearer finding the telepath than they had been three weeks before . with five completely blank human beings to work with , and the sixth queen [female] ( [female] heard privately that the last telepath . the girl from honolulu , was no better than the first five ; she had apparently regressed into what one of the psychiatrists called a `` non identity childhood syndrome . '' [female] did not know what it meant , but it sounded terrible .
and yet i long to be free , free as the young birds , as the very youngest of them . i watch the leaves blowing in the wind and i want to be a leaf . it lay in a corner of the hedge . cruel boys had chased it there with stones . how my heart beats , today a man passed .
he seemed to be enjoying himself , and mr. [male] was anxious lest he might begin to shoot for pure delight . such a demonstration would have been misconstrued , nearly two hundred yards ahead at the heels of the pack galloped the indians . and in the middle distance between them and grady rode lord ploversdale and smith vainly trying to overtake the hounds and whip them off . behind and trailing over a mile or more came the field and the rest of the hunt servants in little groups . all awestruck at what had happened , it was unspeakable that lord ploversdale 's hounds .
he gazed from bindle to the door . from the door to bindle , and back again to the door , during the two seconds that his superior 's eyes were off him bindle slipped stealthily away . the foreman went slowly to the door and opened it , he found there a middle-aged . rather stout man , dressed in tweeds . with trousers clipped for cycling , behind him he held a bicycle .
jones had some heroic ingredients in his composition . and was a hearty well wisher to the glorious cause of liberty . and of the protestant religion , it is no wonder . therefore , that in circumstances which would have warranted a much more romantic and wild undertaking . it should occur to him to serve as a volunteer in this expedition .
she only stared her dislike . her little pig eyes grown smaller and more glittering , you great . big -- thing , i shrieked at her . like an infuriated child , with the tears streaming down my cheeks i unclasped [male] 's cold hands from about my neck . he clung to me , frantically , until i had to push him away and run .
gee whiz , it goes fast . are you sure you can stop it ? better be careful , young man , there was an elevator once in our town that , fifteenth floor , all right . this room , eh , great scott . it 's high up , say , better not go too near that window , boy . that would be a hell of a drop if a feller fell out .
if you do succeed in reconciling her to the water , then she feels sure that the chimneys smoke . they look as if they smoked , why -- as you tell her . the chimneys are the best part of the house . you take her outside and make her look at them . they are genuine sixteenth century chimneys .
we only had one brief little season of heaven and heaven 's sweet ecstasy and peace during all this long and diligent and acrimonious reproduction of the other place . this was while a gorgeous procession of people marched around and around , in the third act . and sang the wedding chorus , to my untutored ear that was music . almost divine music , while my seared soul was steeped in the healing balm of those gracious sounds . it seemed to me that i could almost resuffer the torments which had gone before .
and really it might have confused a less modest man than [male] to find himself sitting next that coachman . for of all the swells that ever flourished a whip professionally , he might have been elected emperor . he did not handle his gloves like another man . but put them on -- even when he was standing on the pavement . quite detached from the coach -- as if the four greys were , somehow or other .
but hoity toity , after much diligent perusal . i arrived at the conclusion that such works were sealed books to the most intelligent foreigner . unless he is furnished with a good scotch grammar and dictionary . how many of your boasted british cabinet , supposed to rule our countless millions of so called indian subjects . would be capable to sit down and read and translate -- correctly -- a single sentence from the mahábhárat in the original ?
to begin with , there was a diabolical abandon in eva 's glitter . which raised it instantly above the common herd 's , and behind it all was that very misty mist . i do not know whether all men have seen that mist ; but i am sure that no man has seen it more than once . and , from what i have seen of the average man , i doubt if most of them have ever seen it at all . well , there it was for me to see in eva eversleigh 's eyes that night at supper .
there was much that was disagreeable in this , miss [male] having just rejected mr [male] 's suit . did not feel quite comfortable in giving him a commission to see all her stockings and petticoats packed up and brought away from the lodgings . indeed , she could give him no commission of the kind . but intimated her intention of writing to the lodging house keeper , he , however . was profuse in his assurances that nothing should be left behind .
the strongest objection was that which would have formerly been an inducement to her , namely , the frequent meeting with young [female] . whom she had determined to avoid ; but as the end of the hunting season now approached . she hoped , by a short absence with her aunt . to reason herself entirely out of her unfortunate passion . and had not any doubt of being able to meet him in the field the subsequent season without the least danger .
she wuz examinin the bark through her eye glasses . but she said mountains and seas could stand more than a tree and i said i guessed the hand that made a tree could keep it alive . [location] is different from any other city under the sun . and after you have been there when you shet you eyes and see it agin in memory . the brilliant colorin sheds its picturesque glow over the brilliant seen .
our company immediately embarked in the machines before described . in which we had journeyed into [location] , and after a few days sail arrived in [location] , we met with nothing curious on our voyage . except a floating island , containing some very delightful villages . inhabited by a few whites and negroes ; the sugar cane did not thrive there well .
to these let me say here and now that there are exceptions to all rules . and that if for instance , i tell the story of a pterodactyl that after being swallowed whole by a discosaurus . successfully gnaws his way through the walls of the latter 's stomach to freedom . i make no claim that all pterodactyls could do the same , but merely that in this particular case the pterodactyl to which i refer did it . and that i know that he did it because the man who saw it is a cousin of my grandfather 's first wife 's step son .
but , o carefull house father . if you knew in what a happy age you live . you would not go away so dissatisfied , but imbrace all these affairs very joifully for extraordinary pleasures . do but see , till now you have had a brave and splendant house . paid great rent , only for your self and family to live in .
shelley was a poet , and perhaps idealized his friends . he saw them , probably , in a state of pure intellect . i am not a poet ; i look at people in the concrete . the most obvious thing about my friends is their avoirdupois . and i prefer that they should wear their own cloaks and suffer me to wear mine .
the king of barodia , he says . demanded the hand of the princess hyacinth for his eldest son . the king of euralia made some commonplace condition as that his royal highness should first ride his horse up a glassy mountain in the district . a condition which his majesty of barodia strongly resented . i am afraid that [male] is incurably romantic ; i have had to speak to him about it before .
wait and see , do not spoil the story . let [location] speak of [female] , [female] mcfiggin had known neither father nor mother . they had both died years before she was born . of her mother she knew nothing . save that she was french , was extremely beautiful , and that all her ancestors and even her business acquaintances had perished in the revolution .
she sat back and screwed her eyes tight , as she had always done when puzzled . something had happened to her , but how it had happened and when it had happened and why it had happened she could not understand . she only knew that now for the first time she had been granted a moment of clear vision and was seeing things truly . she wanted wally , she wanted him in the sense that she could not do without him . she felt nothing of the fiery tumult which had come upon her when she first met derek .
he is a modest man , with a tendency toward the classical in his researches . he took [location] up on the roof . showed [location] the outlying country , and jarred our ear drums with the big bell . mr. [male] , who has general charge of monticello . called montechello -- said that mr. [male] used to sit on his front porch with a powerful glass .
that [organization] had not received his information with joy did not distress him . he had a poor opinion of the feminine intelligence . girls got their minds full of nonsense from reading novels and seeing plays , like [organization] . [organization] objected to those who were wiser than herself providing a perfectly good prince for her to marry . some fool notion of romance , of course .
this lap robe [female] reverently drew away as he knelt beside the still form . and thus , for some moments remained , turning his gaze from right to left . from the great tree which grew close at the motionless feet . and between the group and the water 's edge . its branches spreading out above them and forming a canopy over the body to a dead stump some distance away .
presently the agony seemed to pass , derek recovered , one would say that derek became himself again . but that the mood of gentle remorse which came upon him as he lay in the arm chair was one so foreign to his nature . [organization] had never seen him so subdued , he was like a convalescent child . between them , the all night chemist and the dry . salters seemed to have wrought a sort of miracle .
at first i looked hurriedly toward the brook as each yell clove the air . but , as i became accustomed to it , my attention was diverted by some exquisite ferns . suddenly , however , a succession of shrieks announced that something was wrong . and across a large fern i saw a small face in a great deal of agony . budge was hurrying to the relief of his brother .
always , in the past , she had borne the blows of fate with a stoical indifference which had alternately attracted and repelled me . according as my mood led me to think it courage or insensibility . in the old days , it had done much , this trait of hers . to rear a barrier between us , it had made her seem aloof and unapproachable . subconsciously , i suppose , it had offended my egoism that she should be able to support herself in times of trouble .
when one considers how full of his own troubles , how weighed down with the problems of his own existence the average playgoer generally is when enters a theatre . it is remarkable that dramatists ever find it possible to divert and entertain whole audiences for a space of several hours . as regards at least three of those who had assembled to witness its opening performance . the author of `` tried by fire , '' at the leicester theatre . undoubtedly had his work cut out for him .
i ought to say , ere i forget , she was uncommon comely . ( who ever read a grimm tale yet , in which the girl was homely ? ) and so the king 's announcement drew nine princes in a column . but all in vain , the princess grew , if anything , more solemn . one read her `` innocents abroad , '' the next wore clothes eccentric .
i admire the splendid view , the delicious azure hue of the ocean and . when , whew , with a crack , lo , there drops a little ball which elects to break its fall by alighting on the small of my back . in the distance someone cries some remark about my eyes . none too pleasant , i surmise , from the tone . so away my steps i turn till a figure i discern .
the learned dr misaubin used to say , that the proper direction to him was to dr misaubin . in the world ; intimating that there were few people in it to whom his great reputation was not known . and , perhaps , upon a very nice examination into the matter , we shall find that this circumstance bears no inconsiderable part among the many blessings of grandeur . from that figure , therefore , which the irish peer . who brought sophia to town , hath already made in this history .
one day this young couple accidentally met in the garden . at the end of the two walks which were both bounded by that canal in which [female] had formerly risqued drowning to retrieve the little bird that sophia had there lost . this place had been of late much frequented by sophia , here she used to ruminate . with a mixture of pain and pleasure . on an incident which , however trifling in itself , had possibly sown the first seeds of that affection which was now arrived to such maturity in her heart .
and this marriage would have been of no moment to [location] or to our little history . had not mr maguire chosen that morning . of all mornings in the year , to call on miss mackenzie in arundel street . he had obtained her address -- of course . from miss colza ; and , not having been idle the while in pushing his inquiries respecting miss mackenzie 's affairs .
sept. 7 -- morning , the cold is excessive . the snow falls heavily and without interruption , the guides take no rest , evening . my dear hessie , we have been two days on mont blanc . in the midst of a terrible hurricane of snow . we have lost our way , and are in a hole scooped in the snow .
they asked him what she was like . he did not know enough dutch to describe her properly . all he could tell them was she was a very beautiful woman . of medium size , evidently this did not satisfy them . the description was too general ; any man could say that , and by this means perhaps get possession of a wife that did not belong to him .
the account of the intrusion on [male] in [location] borders on the sacrilegious . here was the venerable philosopher , five months before his death . when his great mind had already gone on before him , being visited by a strange lad with a passion for autographs . who sat and watched for those lucid moments when then sun would break through the clouded brain . making it possible for [male] to hold the pen and form the letters of his name .
and then , one morning , like a voice from another world . had come the news that the white sox and the giants were to give an exhibition in [location] at the chelsea football ground . he had counted the days like a child before christmas . there had been obstacles to overcome before he could attend the game . but he had overcome them , and had been seated in the front row when the two teams lined up before king [male] .
in point of fact it did wipe the gilt off when . about an hour afterwards , georgie went to lunch because he told her . and if there had been any gilt left about anywhere , that would have vanished . too , when in answer to some rather damaging remark she made about poor daisy 's interests in the love affairs of other people 's servants . she learned that it was of the love affairs of their superiors that all riseholme had been talking for at least an hour by now .
ye twain shall not enter here ... silly , was not it ? but i could not get the horror of it out of my head . but i need you , you know that , and you need me . it 's too late , we are helpless now -- in the clutch of forces more potent than our little selves . forces that brought [location] into the world . forces that have made the world , whether you will or no .
so reasoned [female] , and it was precisely my own reasoning . and the reasoning which had got me into numberless difficulties . to say nothing of jails and prisons . but the brother had his doubts about it . and came and talked to me on the subject several times , we quarrelled about it .
that is mauritius ; and pretty enough , the details are few , the massed result is charming . but not imposing ; not riotous , not exciting ; it is a sunday landscape . perspective , and the enchantments wrought by distance , are wanting . there are no distances ; there is no perspective , so to speak , fifteen miles as the crow flies is the usual limit of vision . mauritius is a garden and a park combined .
`` do not mention it , '' said [female] , there are two sorts of country cricket . there is the variety you get at a country house . where the wicket is prepared with a care as meticulous as that in fashion on any county ground . where red marl and such like aids to smoothness have been injected into the turf all through the winter . and where the out fielding is good and the boundaries spacious , and there is the village match .
that he is harnessed to the cart for anybody 's pleasure but his own it is impossible to believe . and i am confident that the german peasant plans the tiny harness and fashions the little cart purely with the hope of gratifying his dog . in other countries -- in [location] , [location] and [male] . i have seen these draught dogs ill treated and over worked ; but in [location] , never . germans abuse animals shockingly , i have seen a german stand in front of his horse and call it every name he could lay his tongue to .
homeward bound , a chastened spirit pervades the traveler . he is not quite so much inclined to be gay and blithesome as he was going . the holiday is over ; the sightseeing is done ; the letter of credit is worn and emaciated . he has been broadened by travel but his pocketbook has been flattened . he would not take anything for this trip .
of course i imbibe alcoholic stimulant when and where procurable . from the standpoint of one intent upon cutting a few running feet off the waistline measurements this distinctly is wrong . as full well i know , but what would you ? i do not wish to pose as an eccentric , i have no desire to be pointed out as a person aiming to make himself conspicuously erratic by behaving differently from the run of his fellows . since the advent of prohibition nearly everybody i meet is drinking with an unbridled enthusiasm .
how sweet are looks that ladies bend on whom their favours fall ! for them i battle till the end . to save from shame and thrall : but all my heart is drawn above . my knees are bow would in crypt and shrine . i never felt the kiss of love .
a woman can make a cross on a paper as well as a man . a child could do it as well as a woman . and a chimpanzee after a few lessons could do it as well as a child . but nobody ought to regard it merely as making a cross on paper . everyone ought to regard it as what it ultimately is .
perceiving the bird was flown , at least despairing to find him , and rightly apprehending that the report of the firelock would alarm the whole house . our heroe now blew out his candle , and gently stole back again to his chamber . and to his bed ; whither he would not have been able to have gotten undiscovered . had any other person been on the same staircase , save only one gentleman who was confined to his bed by the gout . for before he could reach the door to his chamber .
but i did not believe it , for he had a good look to his face . all but the high headed look he had , and sort o ', vain . but except this one look , his face wuz a good moral face . and i knew that no man could cut up and act as he claimed that he had , without carryin some marks on the face of the cuttin
each morning i pursued my game . for spotless monarchs i became an advertiser . but all in vain i searched each land . so , kingless , to my native strand returned , a little older , and a good deal wiser ! king : be just -- the time is now at hand when truth may published be .
the rail was also moving up and down in a manner that was annoying and wearisome for the eye to watch . first tipping up and up and up until half the sky was hidden , then dipping down and down and down until the gray and heaving sea seemed ready to leap over the side and engulf us . so i decided to go below and jot down a few notes , on arriving at my quarters i changed my mind again . i decided to let the notes wait a while and turn in . nevertheless , i tried , i lay as flat as i could .
the king could not overcome his surprise , and looked sometimes at the smiling face of the musketeer . and sometimes at the dark window which opened into the night . but before he had fixed his ideas , eight of d'artagnan 's men . for two had remained to take care of the bark , brought to the house . where parry received him , that object of an oblong form .
[female] 's name had been down for the m.c.c . for some years , and he had become a member during his last season at wrykyn . once or twice a week he managed to get up to lord 's for half an hour 's practice at the nets . and on saturdays the bank had matches . in which he generally managed to knock the cover off rather ordinary club bowling .
unfortunately , the rising generation did not seem disposed to a careful perusal of anything except the baseball scores and the beauty hints in the sunday papers . and mrs. [female] 's public was small , in fact . her only real disciple , as she sometimes told herself in her rare moods of discouragement . was her niece , ruth bannister . daughter of [female] , the millionaire .
so he did ; for the coach rolled off as the words were spoken . mr and mrs mould . in high good humour , went their merry way , mr bailey retired with poll sweedlepipe as soon as possible . but some little time elapsed before he could remove his friend from the ground . owing to the impression wrought upon the barber 's nerves by mrs prig .
that young lady smiled , she knew it at once . her mind straightway filled up the two letters concealed by apostrophic reserve . and i read in her assenting eyes that she knew jawkins was a snob . you seldom get them to make use of the word as yet . it is true ; but it is inconceivable how pretty an expression their little smiling mouths assume when they speak it out .
i am used to being afraid of collisions when i ride or drive . but when one is on top of an elephant that feeling is absent . i could have ridden in comfort through a regiment of runaway teams . i could easily learn to prefer an elephant to any other vehicle . partly because of that immunity from collisions , and partly because of the fine view one has from up there .
so says [female] in that famous chapter of his , and certainly merriwig was very busy . on the declaration of war the euralian forces . in accordance with custom , had marched into barodia . however hot ran the passion between them , the two kings always preserved the elementary courtesies of war . the last battle had taken place in euralian territory .
[male] related the story for the sixteenth time . it was a melancholy pleasure to have found a listener who heard the tale in the right spirit . there was no doubt about [organization] 's interest and sympathy . he was silent for a moment after [male] had finished . [male] was not equal to the task of soothing [organization] 's wounded conscience .
as he rose , a young man sitting immediately in front of him rose too and stared likewise . he was a square built resolute looking young man . who reminded archie vaguely of somebody he had seen before . but archie was too busy trying to locate the man at the back to pay much attention to him . he detected him at last , owing to the fact that the eyes of everybody in that part of the room were fixed upon him .
`` follow the girl , '' an [location] musical comedy . had come over from [location] with an [location] company . of which nelly had been a humble unit , and , after playing a year in [location] and some weeks in the number one towns . had returned to [location] , it did not cheer nelly up in the long evenings in daubeny street to reflect that . if she had wished , she could have gone home with the rest of the company .
generally i took my own stuff to market , and sold medicines and recipes as well . and in [location] i had a first rate practice which i went to that city to attend to once or twice a week . while my man was selling vegetables and fruit . i remember i sold a hundred dollar worth of cherries from my farm the first summer . in the market , i was doctor blank receiving my patients at stanwix [male] .
mr. [male] presented a contrast to his superior . he was short and round , with a dimpled mahogany face and eyes that twinkled in it like little puddles of molasses . his head was bound in a turban and his body was swathed in so many bands and sashes that he looked almost circular . the clothes of both mr. [male] and [male] were covered with the mystic signs of buddha and the seven serpents of [male] . it was impossible , of course , for mr. [male] or mr. [male] to address the audience .
why , dear me , any kind of royalty . howsoever modified , any kind of aristocracy , howsoever pruned . is rightly an insult ; but if you are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably never find it out for yourself . and do not believe it when somebody else tells you . it is enough to make a body ashamed of his race to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or reason .
when we first took up drinking we hoped that this would be one of the avenues of escape from schedule and assignment . but it did not work out , even here there were preliminaries and premeditation . first of all , it was necessary to cultivate a taste for the stuff . but that was only a beginning , there were still ceremonies to be complied with . drunkenness never just descended on anybody like thunderstorm .
at that very moment a cock crowed , and the weird procession vanished and left not a shred or a bone behind . i awoke , and found myself lying with my head out of the bed and `` sagging '' downward considerably . a position favorable to dreaming dreams with morals in them . maybe , but not poetry , note. -- the reader is assured that if the cemeteries in his town are kept in good order . this dream is not leveled at his town at all , but is leveled particularly and venomously at the next town .
we reached the restaurant on the height called the chapeau at four in the afternoon . it was a memento factory , and the stock was large , cheap , and varied . i bought the usual paper cutter to remember the place by , and had person . the mauvais pas , and the rest of the region branded on my alpenstock . then we descended to the valley and walked home without being tied together .
he picked this up before he recognized it as a mutilated fragment from the stale half . loaf of bread he had salvaged . he wondered how he could have forgotten it . even in the plenitude of his banquet , there it was . a mere nubbin of crust and so hard it might almost have been taken for a petrified specimen of prehistoric bread .
lord althorp , when chancellor of the exchequer . having to propose to [organization] a vote of £400 a year for the salary of the archdeacon of bengal . was puzzled by a question from mr. [male] . `` what are the duties of an archdeacon ? '' so he sent one of the subordinate occupants of the treasury bench to the other house to obtain an answer to the question from one of the bishops . to dr. [male] accordingly the messenger went , and repeated the question .
[male] , in spite of his anxiety . could barely check a laugh , mr. [male] was a tall . thin man , with a serious face partially obscured by a grizzled beard . he wore spectacles , through which he peered owlishly at [male] . his body was wrapped in a brown dressing gown , his hair was ruffled , he looked like some weird bird .
for two cents i would have done these things , too ; but nobody offered me two cents . i tried to move that german 's feelings , but it could not be done . he would not give me his diploma . neither would he sell it to me . i told him my friend was sick and could not come himself .
it was his faint snores which she could hear in the adjoining room as . having bathed and dressed , she went down the [female] to where breakfast awaited her . she smiled tolerantly , she had never desired to convert her son to her own early rising habits . for , apart from not allowing him to call his soul his own , she was an indulgent mother . eustace would get up at half past nine , long after she had finished breakfast .
pulpat 's , as every one knows , has the unvarying respectability of the table d'hote . it is not a gay place in the conventional sense . one comes , drinks the red wine , talks perhaps a little more and a little louder than usual under the low . smoky ceilings , and then goes home , it closes up at nine thirty . tight as a drum ; the policeman is paid off and given an extra bottle of wine for the missis .
in the afternoon we called on pope clement . who had heard of our experience with the robbers . and seemed very much interested in our narration of the details of our capture and entertainment . clement seemed to be a nice , smooth man , setting on a purple chair with a purple skull cap on his head . and a purple robe on his fat form , his big toe was presented to [location] for adoration .
it is said that a yankee tin peddler . who had frequently cheated most of the people in the vicinity of a new england village through which he was passing . was induced by some of the acute ones to join them in a drinking bout . he finally became stone drunk ; and in that condition these wags carried him to a dark rocky cave near the village . then , dressing themselves in raw head and bloody bones style , awaited his return to consciousness .
married in blue , he will look it , not you . married in pearl , he the distaff will twirl . married in yellow , poor fellow , poor fellow ! married in brown , down , down , derry down , married in pink , to a slave he will sink . married in crimson , he will dangle your whims on .
it was xmas eve on the old homestead . reader , do you know , by sight . the old homestead ? in the pauses of your work at your city desk . where you have grown rich and avaricious , does it never rise before your mind 's eye . the quiet old homestead that knew you as a boy before your greed of gold tore you away from it ?
the storm did come up at this moment , with no one on deck . it struck with the full force of a tropic hurricane . the boat rocked , the wind blew . and billows swept the deck , at the height of the tempest beulah baxter sprang from the cabin to the deck . clutching wildly at a stanchion , buffeted by the billows she groped a painful way along the side .
on the birth of a friend 's son . sir [male] was requested to become one of the sponsors for his child . sir [male] , whose studies of human nature extended to everything but infant human nature . had evidently been refreshing his boyish recollections of puppies and kittens . for , after looking intently into the child 's eyes , as it was held up for his inspection .
we even knew that he had been dead for a long time . probably a few changes have been made in adapting kiki from the french , kiki is made just a bit more respectable than she was in the french version . but she remains enough of a gamin and a rebel against taste and morals to satisfy the outlaw spirit of an [location] audience . she is for the [location] stage `` a good girl , '' but since this seems to be only the slightest check upon her speech and conduct .
he had come down to the town with this very situation in his mind . a wild idea of doing something to restore his self respect and his credit in the eyes of the house had driven him to the high street . but now that the crisis had actually arrived , he would have given much to have been in his study again . [male] was quite close now , sheen could see the marks which had resulted from his interview with drummond . with all his force sheen hit out , and experienced a curious thrill as his fist went home .
of what use our mad striving , our passionate desire ? will it matter to the ages whether , once upon a time . the union person or the tricolour floated over the battlements of [location] ? yet we poured our blood into its ditches to decide the question . will it matter , in the days when the glacial period shall have come again .
she could see , ah -- suddenly he wondered how much she could see . could she see that the girl who had come in with a party of three men and sat down at the next table was [female] ? ah , could she see that ? could she see that the men brought with them liquor far more potent than pulpat 's red ink condensed threefold ? ... [female] stared breathlessly , half hearing through an auditory ether olive 's low . [female] , as like a persistent honey bee she sucked sweetness from her memorable hour .
soon after losing sight of [location] 's placid waters . we plunged into the gloom of the mountains . and began a long , winding climb among their hidden recesses . at times , shrieking as if in terror , we passed some ghostly hamlet . standing out white and silent in the moonlight against the shadowy hills .
mr sheppherd coughed the small cough of disapproval . he was feeling more than a little aggrieved , he had met owen for the first time at dinner at the house of his uncle [male] . a man of unquestioned substance , whose habit it was to invite each of his eleven nephews to dinner once a year . but mr sheppherd did not know this , for all he knew , owen was in the habit of hobnobbing with the great man every night . he could not say exactly that it was sharp practice on owen 's part to accept his invitation to call .
and the compact sweet is not complete till the high contracting parties meet before the altar of mammon . and the bride must be led to a silver bower . where pearls and rubies fall in a shower that would frighten jupiter ammon ! i need not tell how it befell , ( since jenkins has told the story over and over and over again in a style i can not hope to attain . and covered himself with glory , ) how it befell .
he seemed to be guardin the entrance to this temple . and he looked as if he wuz glad to be there . and i truly wuz glad to have him there , for he ort to be put side by side with [male] . both sailed out on the onknown , both discovered a new world , columbuses world we have got the lay on now considerable . and we have mapped it out and counted the inhabitants .
others again are sworn pigeon merchants , and every market day in the forenoon precisely . let it cost what it will , must be attending there , and the rest of the week both morning and afternoon at their pigeon traps . here in they take an infinite pleasure , hushing up their pigeons to flight . then observing the course they take ; looking upon the turning of their tumblers . and then to the very utmost , commending the actions , carriages and colours of their great runts .
now comes a singular thing : the oddest thing , the strangest thing . the most baffling and unaccountable marvel that australasia can show , at the frontier between new south wales and victoria our multitude of passengers were routed out of their snug beds by lantern light in the morning in the biting cold of a high altitude to change cars on a road that has no break in it from [location] to melbourne ! think of the paralysis of intellect that gave that idea birth . imagine the boulder it emerged from on some petrified legislator 's shoulders . it is a narrow gage road to the frontier .
miss colza was the first to come , she was a young lady somewhat older than miss mackenzie . but the circumstances of her life had induced her to retain many of the propensities of her girlhood . she was as young looking as curls and pink bows could make her . and was by no means a useless guest at a small dinner party . as she could chatter like a magpie , her claims to be called `` mademoiselle '' were not very strong .
to tell him what lost documents were decaying in forgotten corners of the shut up cellars . from whose lattices such mouldy sighs came breathing forth as he went past . to whisper of dark bins of rare old wine , bricked up in vaults among the old foundations of the halls . or mutter in a lower tone yet darker legends of the cross legged knights . whose marble effigies were in the church , with the first planting of his foot upon the staircase of his dusty office .
but her scholars fell off one by one now ; she was forgotten when there were dances and parties among the youth of the village . the young fellows stopped coming to the house , all except wilhelm meidling . and he could have been spared ; she and her uncle were sad and forlorn in their neglect and disgrace . and the sunshine was gone out of their lives , matters went worse and worse . all through the two years , clothes were wearing out , bread was harder and harder to get .
usually , on account of her hatred for the old tin tub . she made this ceremony as short as possible ; but to night , sitting there in this beautiful white tub , she lingered . she could almost close her eyes and imagine herself [female] reclining in her alabaster bath . waited on by slaves ; she reached up and got a bottle of perfume from a shelf over her head and perfumed the waters . and she decided that in addition to the regular saturday night performance she should hereafter play a wednesday matinee .
tinling saw only one hope left , if he could see mrs. [female] and tell her of the danger which threatened him . she might refuse permission to fight at all , or , at the very least . she would see that he had proper assistance . so into the house he went , and the first person he found was hazel . who was knitting her pretty forehead over the latin exercise which had been given her as a holiday task .
sunday is the great day on the continent . the free day , the happy day , one can break the sabbath in a hundred ways without committing any sin . we do not work on sunday , because the commandment forbids it . the germans do not work on sunday , because the commandment forbids it . we rest on sunday , because the commandment requires it .
the figures kept adding and subtracting themselves as he dozed off . and once during the night he dreamed that swearengen [male] had sentenced him to eat a million dollar worth of game and salad at the french restaurant . he awoke with the consciousness that he had cried aloud . `` i can do it , but a year is not very long in an affair of this kind . '' it was nine o'clock when [male] finally rose .
miss [female] burst into florid gratitude . the tavern sign -- a beehive trimmed evenly with bees -- creaked in the wind outside as she thanked him . mr. [male] did not quite understand the situation . but then , he did not desire to understand it , nor to jump to the conclusion of `` another man '' that would have attracted a grosser mind , he only felt that miss [female] knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered .
the forlorn hope had failed ; he was limping back to ruth wounded and broken . he had sent her a wireless message . she would be at the dock to meet him . how could he face her ? fate had been against him . it was true , but he was in no mood to make excuses for himself .
for pocket money , he picked up odd jobs . and it was due to this that he stopped going to parties . at his third party little marjorie haight had whispered indiscreetly and within hearing distance that he was a boy who brought the groceries sometimes . so instead of the two step and polka , jim had learned to throw . any number he desired on the dice and had listened to spicy tales of all the shootings that had occurred in the surrounding country during the past fifty years .
i wrote back that the white eyed pelican from the buckwheat enamelled plains of [location] had not remitted . was not employed by us , and that i would write and publish a little card of introduction for the bilious litterateur that would make people take in their domestic animals . and lock up their front fences and garden fountains . he communed with nature and the coyotes one night and had a pretty tough time of it . he froze his nose partially off , and the coyotes came and gnawed his little dimpled toes .
his main idea was to lie in wait somewhere for [male] . and try the result of an appeal to his better feelings to acknowledge his outcast parent and abdicate gracefully . if that failed , and there was every reason to expect that it would fail . he must threaten to denounce him before the whole party . it would cause a considerable scandal no doubt .
throughout the whole country nothing but the approaching match was discussed . wherever civilization reigned , and in portions of liverpool . one question alone was on every lip : who would win ? octogenarians mumbled it . infants lisped it , tired city men . trampled under foot in the rush for their tram .
we also heard much smothered language coming from underneath it . and we guessed that they were finding the job rather troublesome . and concluded that we would wait until things had got a little simpler before we joined in . we waited some time , but matters seemed to get only more and more involved . until , at last , person 's head came wriggling out over the side of the boat .
bailey 's apprehensions amused him . he had a thorough contempt for all actors . authors , musicians , and artists . whom he classed together in one group as men who did not count . save in so far as they gave mild entertainment to the men who .
`` the flying squirrel '' is an honest account of a live creature that won his way into scores of hearts by his mad pranks and affectionate ways . it is enough that [male] burroughs has commended the poem . of all the woodland creatures , the quaintest little sprite is the dainty flying squirrel in vest of shining white . in coat of silver gray . and vest of shining white , his furry quaker jacket is trimmed with stripe of black .
i leave my reader to imagine my state of mind when i completed the perusal of the letter . i have as little belief in the supernatural as anyone . yet i must confess that there was something in the surroundings in which i now found myself which rendered me at least uncomfortable . my reader may smile if he will , but i assure him that it was with a very distinct feeling of uneasiness that i at length managed to rise to my feet . and , grasping my candle in my hand , to move backward into the bedroom .
but the philanthropic employer of the sort i describe is not a man of any manhood . in a sense he is not a man at all . he shows some consciousness of the fact when he calls his workers `` men '' as distinct from masters . he can not comprehend the gallantry of costermongers or the delicacy that is quite common among cabmen . he finds this social reform by half rations on the whole to his mercantile profit .
when [female] had left , which he did rather in the manner of a heavy father in melodrama . shaking the dust of an erring son 's threshold off his feet . i mixed myself a high ball . and sat down to consider the position of affairs , it did not take me long to see that the infernal boy had double crossed me with a smooth effectiveness which mr fisher himself might have envied . somewhere in this great city , as [male] had observed , he was hiding , but where ?
it is not only the too thin neck that needs to be clothed with discrimination . throats and shoulders that are too robust are improved by being covered , the arms and shoulders . however , are often the chief beauty of a fleshy woman , and it is to her advantage to give them as effective a setting as possible . as is obvious in no , 67 , the stout woman apparently increases her breadth by wearing a flamboyant corsage . and she hides the most exquisite lines of her arm with her sleeves .
reach not after morality and righteousness , my friends . watch vigilantly your stomach , and diet it with care and judgment . then virtue and contentment will come and reign within your heart . unsought by any effort of your own ; and you will be a good citizen . a loving husband , and a tender father—a noble , pious man .
[female] 's mind did not turn immediately to this outlet from his embarrassment . he had never stolen before , and it did not occur to him directly to do so now . there is a conservative strain in all of us , but gradually , as it was borne in upon him that it was the only course possible . unless he applied to his stepfather -- a task for which his courage was not sufficient . he found himself contemplating the possibility of having to secure the money by unlawful means .
the man creeps upstairs on tiptoe and shuts himself in his study . the woman does things before a looking glass . waits till she feels she is sufficiently mistress of herself not to show her feelings . and then enters the drawing room with outstretched hands and the look of one welcoming an angel 's visit . she says how delighted she is to see the bores .
life of [female] : a german ; very deep ; but it was not really noticeable when he sat down . life of dante : an italian ; the first to introduce the banana and the class of street organ known as `` dante 's inferno . '' it is impossible for a busy man to keep these apart , they sought a living as kings and apostles and pugilists and so on . botany is the art of plants . plants are divided into trees , flowers , and vegetables .
it was psmith , however , who resumed the conversation . his manner was almost too respectful ; which made it all the more a pity that what he said did not keep up the standard of docility . he took the key from his pocket . unlocked the cupboard , and took out the boot , then he selected from the basket a particularly battered specimen . placing this in the cupboard , he re locked the door .
`` never mind , '' peterson said , darting out the door . `` i will go down to the barn , '' he jumped from the porch and ran across the yard . he found [male] in the barn . rigging a new block and tackle for the [male] . barney was helping thread the new , manila line from a coil on the straw littered floor .
once upon a time , when i was a very little boy . i remember being very much impressed by a heading in my copybook which ran : he who can learn to write . can learn to draw , now this was putting the cart before the horse . so far as my experience had gone , for i could most certainly draw before i could write . and had not only become an editor long before i was fit to be a contributor .
he sprang from the train , i saw him through the window . moving toward the waiting room , he did not seem going very fast , the porters were calling . `` all abawd , all abawd , '' there was the clang of a bell . a hiss of steam , and in a second the train was off . i waited , looking out of the window and wondering who the man was , anyway .
thank goodness , on saturday i exchange our miserable . wheezy , asthmatic band for the grand orchestra of the covent garden promenade concerts . and the awful perfume of rotten seaweed for the bracing atmosphere of glorious [location] . when the days are bright and hot , in the month of august . when the sunny hours are not marred by any raw gust .
but it was only one weak step , a warm and ample hand placed itself firmly inside the crook of his elbow . `` let 's get started for this one before the floor gets all crowded up , '' said miss boke , at half past one the orchestra played `` home , sweet home . '' as the last bars sounded , a group of earnest young men who had surrounded the lovely guest of honor . talking vehemently , broke into loud shouts , embraced one another and capered variously over the lawn .
yet she was born and reared in a town which for a great many years has held a membership in the national league . let [location] pass on to a more pleasant topic . let [location] pass on to those well meaning but temporarily misguided persons who think they are going to be satisfied with staying on indefinitely in [location] . they profess themselves as being amply pleased with the present arrangement . for , no matter how patriotic one may be , one must concede -- must not one ?
charon paddled up to the side of the craft . and , standing up in the middle of his boat , cried out , there was no answer . and the ferryman hailed her again , receiving no response to his second call . he resolved to investigate for himself ; so , fastening his own boat to the stern post of the stranger . he clambered on board , if he was astonished as he sat in his ferry boat .
you will be in love and make a match . and look at all the worry of the settlement , in which , by the way . you may often be defrauded , you will get married -- a fine ceremony . with a fine feast ; and all the nasty old women of the neighbourhood will come and tell bawdy stories to enliven the occasion . you get married , and thereafter you are at the mercy of your wife .
occasionally his reflections assumed the importance of calculations . his cruise was sure to cost dollar 200,000 , a princely sum . but not enough , swearengen [male] and his cablegram did not awe him to a great extent . the spending of the million had become a mania with him now and he had no regard for consequences . his one desire , aside from peggy , was to increase the cost of the cruise .
when susanna came home she did not seem to know much of mr [male] . junior , or to care much about him , old mr [female] lived . she knew , near the place of business in the new road . and sometimes he came to gower street , but nobody liked him . she did not remember that she had ever seen mr [female] .
the frantic man in the red shirt came tearing back ; he had gone far enough ahead to see that 13 1/4 's boys had got their stream on the fire . and he was furious at the delay , one mighty jerk . and the men and boys were piled in a huge kicking mass on the pavement . which phenomenon was occasioned by the unexpected breaking of the rope . the rope was tied , and by a united effort directed at the wheels .
has been stricken from the program , much time will be spent in the great bear . and , indeed , in every constellation of importance , so , also , with the sun and moon and the milky way . otherwise the gulf stream of the skies . clothing suitable for wear in the sun should be provided . our program has been so arranged that we shall seldom go more than 100,000,000 of miles at a time without stopping at some star .
trembling in every limb , and scarcely daring to breathe , [female] began to rub the wrists of her jealous husband . next she smeared his nostrils ; but as she did so . the old man jerked his head , and [male] was petrified with terror . believing that he was awake , and had caught her in the fact . it was a false alarm , however , and she went on with her task the best way she could .
the bent and venerable major and mrs. [female] ; lawyer riverson . the new notable from a distance ; next the belle of the village . followed by a troop of lawn clad and ribbon decked young heart breakers ; then all the young clerks in town in a body . for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane heads . a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers , till the last girl had run their gantlet .
`` that would not be at all the thing , '' the red queen said very decidedly . so alice tried to submit to it with a good grace , in fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she made her speech . the two queens pushed her so , one on each side . that they nearly lifted her up into the air . `` i rise to return thanks -- '' alice began .
there are several ways of dealing with the mosquito , all more or less unsatisfactory . the commonest is to make careful examination before blowing out the candle . with intent to see that none of the enemy lingers within the curtains of the bed . this is good , as far as it goes , but , having spent half an hour with candle in hand inside the curtains . to the imminent danger of setting the premises on fire .
how they hurled themselves against the angry foe . in the jungle and the trenches on the hill ! when the word to charge was given , every dude was on the go . he was there to die , to capture , or to kill , oh , he struck his level when men were called upon again to preserve the ancient glory of the old red . white , and blue , he has thrown his spats away .
this remarkable child had a keen sense of humour . thus he seldom began to cry in his best vein till the small hours of the morning . and on these occasions he would almost invariably begin again after he had been officially pronounced to be asleep . his sudden grab at the hair of any adult who happened to come within reach was very droll , too . as to his other characteristics , he was of rather an imperious nature .
this delicate reference to morrison 's tender years had the effect of creating a disturbance . two school house juniors . who happened to be passing , naturally forsook all their other aims and objects and joined the battle . `` what 's up ? '' asked one of them , dusting himself hastily as they stopped to take breath . it was always his habit to take up any business that might attract his attention .
then they knocked up a little place for him at the bottom of the garden . about quarter of a mile from the house . and made him take the machine down there when he wanted to work it . and sometimes a visitor would come to the house who knew nothing of the matter . and they would forget to tell him all about it .
no more customers came that day , which was fortunate . perhaps , for them , the afternoon passed , and dusk approached . but the hairdresser sat on , motionless , in his darkening saloon . without the energy to light a single gas jet , at last he roused himself sufficiently to go to the head of the stairs leading to his `` labatry , '' and call for [male] , who , it appeared , was composing an egg wash .
experts were called in to see if it might not be possible to so divide the district that person might get a quarter . [location] a quarter and england fifty cents . it was suggested that the line be drawn down through globe wernicke to the mouth of the iser . as gambetta said , the line had to be drawn somewhere and it might as well be there . but lord hay paunceforte , representing england , refused to concede the point and for a time it looked like an open breach .
and [female] , seizing a stick , hurled it at the intruder . get out o here , he roared , the aged horse nervously withdrew his head . turned tail , and made a rickety flight up the alley . while [male] and penrod , perfectly obedient to inherited impulse . ran out into the drizzle and uproariously pursued , they were but automatons of instinct .
[female] wiped away her tears , and seized the first one that came to her hand . the cow , without saying a word , kicked over the empty bucket . and walked away , disgust expressed in every hair of her body . [female] , crying quietly , followed her , by patting her on her neck . and letting her wipe her nose upon my coat -- which seemed to comfort her .
i but too soon discovered , turning my head gently to one side . i perceived , to my extreme horror , that the huge , glittering , scimetar like minute hand of the clock had . in the course of its hourly revolution , descended upon my neck . there was , i knew , not a second to be lost , i pulled back at once . but it was too late , there was no chance of forcing my head through the mouth of that terrible trap in which it was so fairly caught .
`` do not run into anything , '' said [female] , immovably , `` there 's something in that view of yours , too , '' said [male] , and shut down the trap , they sped on through shining streets that shot by them like arrows . mr. [male] had evidently a great deal of unused practical talent which was unrolling itself in this ridiculous adventure . they had got away with such stunning promptitude that the police chase had in all probability not even properly begun . but in case it had , the amateur cabman chose his dizzy course through [location] with a strange dexterity .
not when you know how happy it would make me to have you with me once again . i do so long to be telling you everything , then she leant against him and embraced him . and implored him to grant her this favour , but he would not yield . he had told himself that the dean had interfered between him and his wife . and that he must at any rate go through the ceremony of taking his wife away from her father .
as the singer started the second verse , mrs. [female] was conscious that someone was behind her . she turned to find miss [female] standing at her shoulder . a moment later she realised that the little passage was overflowing with carol singers . still she made no sign , not even when miss [female] slipped past her and took up a position behind her mother 's chair . mrs. [female] realised that she was faced with a delicate situation .
in [location] and white corolla , was one who had eyes of blue . a little excuse of a baby nose , little pink ears . and ten little toes , and a mouth that kept saying ah goo , ah gooing as i came near her . she raised up her arms in glee . her little fat arms -- and she seemed to say , i am ready to go with you right away .
let [location] enter upon the ever fascinating task of comparing the old with the new , to represent the ancients we will take that immortal giant , [male] . with him , as they say in legal circles , [male] . many people will say , and they will be right , that [male] would make a much braver show for the old brigade if put forward alone . minus his depressing companion , but we must bear in mind that it takes more than one book to represent a literary era . we will therefore call upon [male] and [male] williams between them to represent the schoolboy of a bygone age .
she liked [female] pickering and she was devoted to claire . it made her happy to think that it was she who had brought them together . but of the other members of the party , [male] pickering was unhappy because he feared that burglars were about to raid the house . roscoe sherriff because he feared they were not . claire because , now that the news of the engagement was out .
[female] 's uncle , you see . did not want him to be an artist , he did not think he had any talent in that direction . he was always urging him to chuck art and go into the jute business and start at the bottom and work his way up . jute had apparently become a sort of obsession with him . he seemed to attach almost a spiritual importance to it .
thinking he would be satisfied with what he had had , and would go quietly home . but instead of this , he commenced an assault and battery on her door . and before she could unlock it , he had not only forced it off the hinges . but had shivered one of the panels to pieces with his foot . she was now more alarmed than ever , and fearing he might even attempt to serve her as he had served the oysters .
mr. [male] conversed with me frequently during our journey . and did not seem to feel above me , i opened the conversation by telling him that i had seen a number of his works . nothing pleases a young author so much as a little friendly remark in relation to his work . i had seen a study of his one day in [location] last spring . it was an italic nose with quotation marks on each side .
so he went on into town , and singled out a main street merchant who refused to advertise . as he sat and meditated , two players passed him . they were going the long round , and the frenzy was upon them . they followed the gutta percha balls with the intent swiftness of trained bird dogs . and each talked feverishly of brassy lies , and getting past the [male] .
i saw that dandy 's curious game played afterward . in [location] , but not for amusement ; not with a motive of any sort . indeed , but simply from a selfish indifference to other people 's comfort and rights . one does not see it as frequently in [location] as he might expect to . for there the law says , in effect , `` it is the business of the weak to get out of the way of the strong . ''
but it was vain to wish this , for all the watchman knew this young man had never been beyond the walls of the forbidden city . nor would he know any reason why the besieger should not forever be kept outside . he would fix that next time , he approached the window of the casting office with mingled emotions . he did not hope to find his friend again stricken with headache . but if it chanced that she did suffer he hoped to be the first to learn of it .
i am anxious that you should be a good scholar . but i am more anxious that you should be a good clean man , and if you graduate with a sound conscience . i sha not care so much if there are a few holes in your latin . there are two parts of a college education . the part that you get in the schoolroom from the professors .
monday , may 4 , steaming slowly in the stupendous delagoa bay . its dim arms stretching far away and disappearing on both sides . it could furnish plenty of room for all the ships in the world . but it is shoal , the lead has given [location] three 1/2 fathoms several times and we are drawing that . lacking six inches , a bold headland -- precipitous wall .
to return to the matter of house rent , good houses . properly furnished , in european capitals , are not to be had at small figures . consequently , our foreign representatives have been accustomed to live in garrets -- sometimes on the roof . being poor men , it has been the best they could do on the salary which the government has paid them . how could they adequately return the hospitalities shown them ?
the blow was a severe one to mr. [male] , as it would have been to any lover who loved a half ton of beauty only to have her shrink to five pounds less than nothing . for several days he remained locked in his office . hardly touching food , and then , with a sad heart he resumed his customary occupations . he would never have learned the truth about syrilla had it not been for a tramp called [organization] . [organization] made the long walk from derlingport .
the east of the sanjak occupies a more easterly position . here the sun rises -- at first slowly , but gathering speed as it goes . after having traversed the entire width of the whole sanjak , the magnificent orb . slowly and regretfully , sinks into the west , on the south . where the soil is more fertile and where the land begins to be worth occupying .
the german citizen is a soldier , and the policeman is his officer . the policeman directs him where in the street to walk , and how fast to walk . at the end of each bridge stands a policeman to tell the german how to cross it . were there no policeman there , he would probably sit down and wait till the river had passed by . at the railway station the policeman locks him up in the waiting room .
so i only `` courted '' the widow , calling upon her almost every day . and i was received and presented to her acquaintances as her affianced husband . her family and immediate friends were violently opposed to the match . thereby showing their good sense , i was also informed that they knew something of my previous history . and i was warned that i had better not undertake to marry the widow .
the magistrate , face to face with these three facts . looked the picture of misery , it was evident to him . as it must be evident to every fair minded man , that the police were in the wrong . and when the magistrate was thinking out this dilemma , i made a fatal mistake . i gave my reason for appearing as a sacrifice on my part to show the magistrate the sort of evidence upon which poor cabmen and others are fined and made to suffer .
she was weeping with excitement as he overtook her . `` brave , '' she said , `` brave , '' and he ceased to feel like a hunted thief . he looked over his shoulder and about him . and saw that they were already out of bognor -- for the vicuna stands at the very westernmost extremity of the sea front . and riding on a fair wide road , the ostler rushed violently down the road vociferating after them .
a cold , ambiguous smile was the only reply he received to this speech . `` well , let [location] see when this restraint is to begin , '' cried the boy . passionately , as he moved towards the door ; but no impediment was offered to his departure . on the contrary , the servant , at a signal from the prefect . threw wide the two sides of the folding doors , and the youth passed out .
it carries a sense of satisfaction entirely disproportionate to the amount of effort entailed . even the failure to put a single line on paper brings no remorse . for it is easy to convince yourself that the thing would have had no chance in the commercial theater . all this would be well enough except that the author of a phantom play is apt to remain a martyr throughout his life . he makes a very bad husband and father and a worse bridge partner .
if this story proves anything ( beyond the advantage of being in good training when you fight ) . it proves that you can not get away from the moving pictures even in a place like millbourne . for as [female] sat there , nursing [female] . it suddenly struck her that this was the very situation with which that romance of the middle ages ', film ended . you know the one i mean .
there is a trait in the lives of great diplomatists of which it is just possible some one or other of my readers may not have heard . which is , that none of them have ever attained to any great eminence without an attachment . we can find no better word for it . to some woman of superior understanding who has united within herself great talents for society with a high and soaring ambition . they who only recognize in the world of politics the dry details of ordinary parliamentary business .
nor let it be taken amiss that any comparison should be made between the mutual cordiality of animals and that of men . for much useful knowledge and many salutary precepts have been taught by the brute creation . we may learn gratitude as well as vigilance from cranes . foresight from ants , modesty from elephants . and loyalty from horses , if you refuse my griefs to know .
april 21 , 1920. -- although we do not know the exact legal form , we think we have seen announcements of somewhat the same sort . at any rate , we want to advertise the fact that on and after this date we will not be responsible for persons who may be injured by falling objects while passing the apartment house on the west side of seventh avenue between fifty fifth and fifty sixth streets . our first hint of the danger came when the hairbrush disappeared and could not be found . that was only circumstantial evidence , but on monday we caught him in the act of tossing out a hand mirror . it was our idea to dissuade him by trying to make him understand that breaking mirrors is bad luck .
he probably imagined that he was merely tapping , and certainly his blows were not to be compared with those he delivered in the exercise of his professional duties . but , nevertheless , sheen had never felt anything so painful before , not even in his passage of arms with [male] . he came out of the encounter with a swollen lip and a feeling that one of his ribs was broken . and he had not had the pleasure of landing a single blow upon his slippery antagonist . who flowed about the room like quicksilver , but he had not flinched .
as a result of this run on the banks of the potomac . the north suddenly decided that the war might last a week or two longer than at first stated . that the foe could not be killed with cornstalks , and that a mistake had been made in judging that the rebellion was not loaded . half a million men were called for and five hundred million dollar voted , general [male] took command of the army of the potomac . the battle of ball 's bluff resulted disastrously to the union forces .
in september miss [female] moved into an attractive house on the west side . bought some new furniture , and installed a maid in the kitchen . all under miss [male] 's kindly supervision , in september . too , [male] and [male] blaisdell came home . and the young people began to prepare for the coming school year .
galileo received but sixty scudi per year as his salary while at pisa . and a part of that he took in town orders . worth only sixty cents on the scudi , there was a ring at the front door bell . letitia , wrought up , nervously clutched my arm , for a moment a sort of paralysis seized me . then , alertly as a young calf , i bounded toward the door .
the enemy 's flank would be turned , and the rest of the battle would become a mere rout . i should have an accepted position in the literary world which would convert all the other avenues to wealth on which i have my eye instantly into royal roads . obstacles would vanish , the fact that i was a successful playwright would make the acceptance of the sort of work i am doing now inevitable . and i should get paid ten times as well for it . and it would mean -- well , you know what it would mean .
as bannister had said , the work in the postage department was not intricate . there was nothing much to do except enter and stamp letters . and , at intervals , take them down to the post office at the end of the street . the nature of the work gave [male] plenty of time for reflection . he looked through the letters he had stamped .
lord belpher remained where he stood , brooding . reason told him he ought to be satisfied . but he was not satisfied , it would have been different had he not known that this fellow with whom [male] had become entangled was in the neighbourhood . and if that scoundrel had had the audacity to come and take a cottage at the castle gates . why not the audacity to invade the castle itself ?
plays and novels which picture meetings between fathers and sons parted from birth or before have always seemed singularly unconvincing to us . the old man says `` my boy , my boy ! '' and weeps , and the young man looks him warmly in the eye and says . `` there , there , '' not a bit like it is our guess . if we had never seen h , 3rd , and had then met him at the end of twenty years .
i have read this absurd item over and over again , with all its insinuating plausibility . until my head swims ; but i can make neither head nor tail of it . there certainly seems to have been an accident of some kind or other , but it is impossible to determine what the nature of it was . or who was the sufferer by it , i do not like to do it . but i feel compelled to request that the next time anything happens to one of mr. [male] 's friends .
charity wife of gideon bligh underneath this stone doth lie naught was she e'er known to do that her husband told her to . here lies the wife of brother [female] . whom tyrant death has torn from us , her husband never shed a tear . until his wife was buried here , and then he made a fearful rout . for fear she might find her way out .
probably every freeborn [location] citizen has at some time in his life cherished the dream of going to england and buying himself an outfit of english clothes . just as every woman has had hopes of visiting [location] and stocking up with parisian gowns on the spot where they were created . and where -- so she assumes -- they will naturally be cheaper than elsewhere , those among [location] who no longer harbor these fancies are the men and women who have tried these experiments . english clothes are not meant for americans , but for englishmen to wear . that is a great cardinal truth which americans would do well to ponder , possibly you have heard that an englishman 's clothes fit him with an air .
that one thing is doing a great deal toward keeping quite a number of people here who would otherwise . i think , go away , as you enter ludlow street jail the door is carefully closed after you . and locked by means of an iron lock about the size of a pictorial family bible . you then remain on the inside for quite a spell . you do not hear the prattle of soiled children any more .
but one morning he noticed , on moving to the window after breakfast . that not a word was proceeding either from the butler or the housekeeper . but that , on the contrary , the courtyard seemed to smack of a certain bustle and excitement . this was because through the entrance gates ( which the kitchen maid and the scullion had run to open ) . there were appearing the noses of three horses -- one to the right .
and now they were in the last two hundred yards , [female] by this time some thirty yards ahead . but in great straits , drake had quickened his pace , and gained slowly on him . as they rounded the corner and came into the straight . the cheers were redoubled , it was a great race . then , fifty yards from the tape , drake began his final sprint .
another time he said that the chair was making itself ridiculous before all [location] . in fact , some of [male] 's language was almost unparliamentary . by and by he struck the idea of beating out a tune with his board . later he decided to stop asking for the floor , and to confer it upon himself . and so he and dr. lecher now spoke at the same time , and mingled their speeches with the other noises .
a moment 's halt , a momentary taste of bitter . and amid the trickling waste i wrought strange shapes from máh to máhi . yet i know not what i wrote , nor why they chased , now i beyond the pale am safely past . o , but the long , long time their rage shall last . which , tho they call to supper , i shall heed as a stone cat should heed a pebble cast .
it was when we had got the skin off him that we began to realize our difficulties . i do not know if you have had the skin of a fair sized toad in your hand . if so , you will understand that our first feeling was one of surprise that a whole toad could ever have got into it . there seemed to be no shape about the thing at all , you could have carried it . no doubt we did , i have forgotten .
he tore in the direction whence came the patter of retreating foot steps . fenn was up first , many years experience of being tackled at full speed on the football field had taught him how to fall . the stranger , whose football days . if he had ever had any , were long past , had gone down with a crash . and remained on the pavement , motionless , fenn was conscious of an ignoble impulse to fly without stopping to chat about the matter .
to find a man with a fortune telling wife is no easy matter . for most of the marriages contracted by these ladies are by no means of a permanent character . and the male parties to the temporary partnerships are always kept in the background . but if he could discover up a wizard , a masculine master of the black art . there were strong probabilities that such an individual could put him in the way of winning a miracle working spouse .
i never feel my utter unworthiness as i do in the presence of a setting hen . when the adult hen in my presence expresses a desire to set i excuse myself and go away . that is the supreme moment when a hen desires to be alone , that is no time for me to introduce my shallow levity . i never do it is after death that i most fully appreciate the hen . when she has been cut down early in life and fried i respect her , no one can look upon the still features of a young hen overtaken by death in life 's young morning .
he ponders over this calamity just as if it were the crushing stroke by which a man 's whole career was to be finished forever . i need scarcely say that there is nothing to be gained by reason ing with him . he has worked himself up to a chronic fury . and talks of vengeance all day long . like a corsican , for company here i have an old brother officer of my days of tinsel and pipe clay .
it seemed impossible that he should ever move , [male] grew restless with this rigidity . and at last , after calling his companion twice or thrice , went up and clapped him impatiently on one of his big shoulders . [male] winced and leapt away from him with a repulsion which was not the hate of an unclean thing nor the dread of a dangerous one . but was a spasm of awe and separation from something from which he was now sundered as by the sword of god . he did not hate the atheist ; it is possible that he loved him .
i have every expectation of being a professor one of these days . indeed , i may say i am certain of it . but my dear auntie -- you know all about that already , but i can not understand how you can have made it go far enough for two . and especially travelling with a lady -- they tell me that makes it ever so much more expensive . yes , of course -- it makes it a little more expensive .
with which expert advice , he allowed [male] to go on his way . the postman was at the door when he got there . apparently absorbed in conversation with the parlor maid . psmith stood by politely till the postman . who had just been told it was like his impudence , caught sight of him .
this gave his hair a rich mahogany shade . and his hat smelled and looked like an oil refinery . that is the reason nemesis spared the hat . and ate a couple of porousplasters that his master was going to use on a case of croup . at that time the doctor came in , and the dog ran to him with a glad cry of pleasure .
breaking out at night , however , was a different thing altogether , it was on another plane . there are times when a master must waive sentiment . and remember that he is in a position of trust . and owes a duty directly to his headmaster , and indirectly , through the headmaster . to the parents , he receives a salary for doing this duty .
that settled it , the battle was over , the most skilful general must sometime recognise defeat . i recognised it then , and threw up my hand . i could do nothing further with them . i had done my best for the farm , i could do no more , chaos followed . indoors and out of doors they raged without check .
she meant , i suppose , to go to the clarkes in staffordshire . for she has no other acquaintances , but she shall be punished . she shall have him , i have sent [male] to town to make matters up if he can . for i do not by any means want her here , if miss summers will not keep her . you must find me out another school .
investigation would show that the old servant had come perilously near laying himself open to a charge of breach of trust . and even of defalcation with regard to the money . and all this danger he was heroically incurring for the unselfish purpose of serving the interests of his employer . during our long interview old sanderson gradually became a hero in my eyes . and entirely in opposition to the resolution i had made at the beginning .
we passed two or three of our fellos that was done in , then a bunch of barb wire with a couple of doboys workin like hell with wire clippers . our shells had busted it up pretty good but there was an awful lot to bust . just as we got thru the wire somebody says `` look out . '' a fritz was runnin toward [location] thru the fog . his hands was floppin over his head kind of loose an he was makin the queerest noises i ever heard .
but in spite of his determination to unbosom himself without further delay . he knew that a kind of fascinated resignation was growing upon him and gaining firmer hold each minute . something must be done to break the spell and burst the toils which were being woven round him before all effort became impossible . `` and now , '' said the doctor , glancing up at the great clock face on which a reflector cast a patch of dim yellow light . `` we must be thinking of starting , but do not forget what i have said . ''
but they loved him , and so did i , with a deep , pantin ' , tired out affection . we loved him better and better as the days rolled by . the tireder we got with him seemin'ly . the more we loved him , but one hope that had boyed me up durin the first weeks of my intercourse with him , died out .
now many people at that time saw the devil fleeing before the two friars . so that , esteeming it to be a sign of special grace . these people did ever thereafter acknowledge the friars to be saints . and unto this day you shall hear ofgonsol andfrancis . unto this day , too , doth the devil , with that same booke wherewith he tempted the friar of old .
the grim [female] porter taps at the door . number five hundred billion and twenty eight , your boatman is waiting , sir . ', so ! is it time already ? we pick up our counters . of what use are they ? in the country the other side of the river they are no tender . the blood red for gold , and the pale green for love , to whom shall we fling them ?
she flung her arms round the injured man . who was ruefully examining a hand which , always of an out size , was now swelling to still further dimensions . a sudden chill gripped archie , so engrossed had he been with his mission that it had never occurred to him that the love lorn pitcher might have taken it into his head to follow the girl as well in the hope of putting in a word for himself . yet such apparently had been the case , well , this had definitely torn it . two loving hearts were united again in complete reconciliation , but a fat lot of good that was .
nevertheless events did not turn out as chichikov had intended they should . in the first place , he overslept himself . that was check number one , in the second place , on his rising and inquiring whether the britchka had been harnessed and everything got ready . he was informed that neither of those two things had been done , that was check number two . beside himself with rage , he prepared to give selifan the wigging of his life .
the door closed behind her , winnifred clair . once more upon the street , sank down upon the steps of the building in a swoon . but at this very juncture providence , which always watches over the innocent and defenceless . was keeping its eye direct upon winnifred , at that very moment when our heroine sank fainting upon the doorstep . a handsome equipage , drawn by two superb black steeds , happened to pass along the street .
the question of phantasmic apparitions , and the development of astral bodies . was of course quite a different matter , and really not under his control . it was his solemn duty to appear in the corridor once a week . and to gibber from the large oriel window on the first and third wednesdays in every month . and he did not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations .
it was the quickest operation that ever was , i simply saw a sudden flash in the air of clubs . brickbats , fists , bead baskets , and moccasins . a single flash , and they all appeared to hit me at once . and no two of them in the same place , in the next instant the entire tribe was upon me . they tore half the clothes off me .
`` indeed , '' said [female] , leering over the side of the flying ship . `` may i ask what you are going to do ? '' the monk pointed downward at ludgate hill . `` i am going , '' he said , `` to climb up into a star . '' those who look at the matter most superficially regard paradox as something which belongs to jesting and light journalism . paradox of this kind is to be found in the saying of the dandy .
mr. [male] had never , since he came to lodge here . possessed more than one pair of boots , this fact had been for her a lasting source of annoyance . for it meant that she had to polish mr. [female] boots always in the early morning , when there were so many other things to be done . instead of choosing her own time , her annoyance had been all the keener because mr. [female]
the whole day was employed in rest and the pleasures of reunion . [female] and pierre nouquet killed some sea birds near the hut . whence it was not prudent to stray far , these fresh provisions and the replenished fire raised the spirits of the weakest . [female] got visibly better , it was the first moment of happiness these brave people had experienced . they celebrated it with enthusiasm in this wretched hut .
after i grew larger , my parents sent me to a military school . that is where i got the fine military learning and stately carriage that i still wear . my room was on the second floor , and it was very difficult for me to leave it at night . because the turnkey locked [location] up at nine o'clock every evening . still , i used to get out once in a while and wander around in the starlight .
firearms , too , were open to objection , and would scarcely assist my mother 's slumbers . so for some time we were at a loss for a remedy . at last , one day , walking down the strand , i chanced to see what struck me as the very thing . it was an air gun of superior construction displayed in a gunsmith 's window . i went in at once , purchased it , and took it home in triumph .
but this curious personal element , with its appalling lack of patriotism . has appeared in a new and curious form in another department of life . the department of literature , especially periodical literature . and the form it takes is the next example i shall give of the way in which the capitalists are now appearing . more and more openly , as the masters and princes of the community .
i was making money at this business when . in an evil moment , i was induced to merge it in the cur spattering . a somewhat analogous , but , by no means , so respectable a profession , my location . to be sure , was an excellent one , being central , and i had capital blacking and brushes . my little dog , too , was quite fat and up to all varieties of snuff .
lubly ran true to form , the british serving classes are ever like that , whether met with at sea or on their native soil . they are a great and a noble institution , give an english servant a kind word and he thanks you . give him a harsh word and he still thanks you . ask a question of a [location] policeman . he tells you fully and then he thanks you .
they fought -- like brave men , long and well ; they piled that ground with moslem slain . they conquered -- but bozzaris fell , bleeding at every vein . his few surviving comrades saw his smile when rang their proud hurrah . and the red field was won ; then saw in death his eyelids close calmly . as to a night 's repose , like flowers at set of sun .
three weeks after this mock marriage . however , i told [female] that i was going to travel about the state a while to sell my medicines . and that i might be absent for some time , she made no objections . and as i was going with my own team she asked me to take some mantillas and a few other goods which were a little out of fashion . and see if i could not sell them for her , to be sure i would .
there is a bit of truth in this we would all admit . i have no doubt , if we studied the question . clothes affect our own poise , ease , and attitude toward others and the expression of others toward us . but , after all , we rely upon the man or woman instead of upon the impression we receive from the clothes . the garments , after we have noticed them in a superficial way .
and to think we invited you , of all people . here today of all days , [ to john. ] we must not let rex know . the bakers do not believe in divorce , she 's landed him ! she 's landed him , we are marrying into the [male] family ! the [female] family , [ shaking hands right and left. ] why .
the colonel knocked at this house with the air of a man who lived there . and an irish girl popped her head out of one of the top windows to see who it was . pending her journey downstairs , the pigs were joined by two or three friends from the next street . in company with whom they lay down sociably in the gutter . `` is the major indoors ? '' inquired the colonel , as he entered .
the squire who owned the hounds was highly pleased with the arrival of his brother squire and sportsman . for all men approve merit in their own way . and no man was more expert in the field than mr western , nor did any other better know how to encourage the dogs with his voice . and to animate the hunt with his holla , the conversation was entertaining enough . and what we may perhaps relate in an appendix , or on some other occasion .
but it is a sight , i spoze . to see all the performances they had to go through , the hard labor of years and years . to persuade niagara to do what they had planned for it to do . but as i say , this great giant is chained by one foot . as it were , and is doin good day 's works .
his speeches , however , were laboured , and , as one of the irish members remarked to me in the lobby . it had a curious effect on them to see mr. [male] sit down after making an important speech without hearing a single cheer . and whereas for years he had addressed the house with the greatest calmness . his chief characteristic being his `` reserve force , '' he now changed all this . and one friday night caused quite a sensation in the house in his attack upon mr. [male] .
mr. [male] was as good as his word . he got a french chief with an aristocratic saturnine countenance . and a moustache and imperial that recalled the late napoleon iii . no one knew where mr. [male] got him . some people in the town said he was a french marquis .
the sick man -- i do not want to wait any longer , tell me that joke of yours and let 's go . the light softens a little , the room is almost rose color now , it might be from the sunset . the fat man gently pushes the head of the sick man back on the pillow . leaning over , he whispers in his ear briefly and the sick man roars with laughter . as his laughter slackens a little the fat man says , `` i will meet you in the press box , ''
the major 's dining room window was open , and as miss [female] passed it . she could not help hearing loud , angry remarks about eggs coming from inside . that made it clear that he was still at breakfast . and that if he had been working at his diaries in the fresh morning hours and forgetting the time . early rising , in spite of his early retirement last night .
mr. [male] 's feeling of satisfaction grew still greater . it was a fine day ; he had a dutiful daughter . and he was going to see [female] mortimer in a [location] hat . providence was spoiling him , the valet withdrew like a duke leaving the royal presence . not actually walking backwards but giving the impression of doing so ; and mr. [male] .
finally , after an age , [female] and [female] turned . still close in talk , still solemn and enigmatical , and drew toward [location] very slowly and deliberately . when they had got quite close , and the tension was at the breaking point . [female] suddenly made a little rush , and , with a loud sob . threw her arms round [female] 's neck .
your first concern should be , of course , your costume . if you have a high voice ( although really there is no reason for supposing that all dry agents have high voices ) . you might well attend the masquerade disguised as a lady . one of the neatest and , on the whole , most satisfactory of ladies disguises is that of [female] , [female] , as you know .
preferring , with a view to the gratification of his tickling and ripping fancies . to dwell upon the outskirts of society , and in the more remote towns and cities . he was in the habit of emigrating from place to place . and establishing in each some business -- usually a newspaper -- which he presently sold . for the most part closing the bargain by challenging , stabbing , pistolling , or gouging the new editor .
so glad , in fact , that it did not seem possible that anything could ever get me out of the country again . i had not enjoyed a pleasure abroad which seemed to me to compare with the pleasure i felt in seeing [location] harbor again . [location] has many advantages which we have not . but they do not compensate for a good many still more valuable ones which exist nowhere but in our own country . then we are such a homeless lot when we are over there !
they are saying this as they surge out in great waves of furs and silks . with black crush hats floating on billows of white wraps among the foam of gossamer scarfs . through it all is the squawk of the motor horn . the call of the taxi numbers and the inrush of the fresh night air . but just inside the theater , in the office , is a man in a circus waistcoat adding up dollar with a blue pencil .
there was the fall of a foot on the stairs which she heard long before it reached him . and , in a moment , she was in her chair . he looked at her , and there was no trace of a tear . `` it 's [female] , '' she said . putting her finger up to her mouth with almost a comic gesture .
man criticizes woman , we are not altogether pleased with woman . we discuss her shortcomings , we advise her for her good . if only english wives would dress as french wives , talk as [location] wives . cook as german wives , if only women would be precisely what we want them to be . patient and hard-working , brilliantly witty and exhaustively domestic , bewitching , amenable , and less suspicious .
you answered him ; it 's nearly nine o'clock already . and the show closes at ten , and true to your prophecy the curtain fell at the time appointed . and his troubles were of the past , you showed [location] the truth behind the mask . when pompous lord shallow , in ermine and wig . went to take his seat amid the fawning crowd .
especially the ants , which went tickling along in wearisome procession from one end of me to the other by the hour . and are a kind of creatures which i never wish to sleep with again , it would be my advice to persons situated in this way . to not roll or thrash around , because this excites the interest of all the different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want to turn out and see what is going on . and this makes things worse than they were before , and of course makes you objurgate harder . too , if you can , still , if one did not roll and thrash around he would die .
now there had come a sudden change ; but she did not at all know how far she might go to meet the change . nor what the change altogether meant , she had been made sure by her father 's question that he had taught himself to hope . he would not have asked her whether she liked him . would not , at any rate , have asked that question in that voice . had he not been prepared to be good to her had she answered in the affirmative .
[male] had not been greatly fascinated by the stranger 's looks . but , after all , the most supercilious person on earth has a right to his own property . besides , he might have been quite a nice fellow when you got to know him . anyhow , the bag had better be returned at once , the trainwas already moving quite fast . and [male] 's compartment was nearing the end of the platform .
sir [male] had a servant who was as great an original as his master . two days after the death of the baronet . this man waited upon a gentleman , who had been a most intimate friend of sir boyle . for the purpose of telling him that the time at which the funeral was to have taken place had been changed . sir , says he , my master sends his compliments to you .
cassandra retreated hastily to her bedroom to bathe her eyes before appearing at tea . `` oh , clytemnestra , radiant as the dawn , '' but there was a dangerous glitter in his eye that might have given the baroness warning . he had composed the verse himself . inspired and thoroughly carried away by his subject ; he suffered , therefore , a double pang in beholding his tribute deflected from its destined object . and his words mutilated and twisted into what became an extravagant panegyric on the baroness 's personal charms .
if time had done much for [male] , it had done more for his fellow emigrant , eddy moore . he had always been good-looking and -- according to local standards -- presentable , tall , slim . with dark eyes that made you catch your breath when they looked into yours . and a ready flow of speech , he had been dunsterville 's prize exhibit . and here he was with all his excellence heightened and accentuated by the polish of the city .
yes , but what are we to do in the meantime ? [male] . and giu . we want our tea , anni . i think we may make an interim order for double rations on their majesties entering into the usual undertaking to indemnify in the event of an adverse decision , gior . that , i think , will meet the case , but you must work hard . stick to it -- nothing like work , giu . oh , certainly , we quite understand that a man who holds the magnificent position of king should do something to justify it .
how [male] 's heart had beat for him . would he make that million dollar ? would she ever live to see it ? and as the years passed she and [female] had often sat in the evenings picturing [male] at home again . bringing with him a million dollar , or picturing the million dollar sent by express with love . but the years had passed , [male] came not , he did not come .
now as [male] stopped as near to no , 262 as the presence of a waiting two horse carriage permitted . he saw a grey haired and blue cloaked woman solemnly descending the steps of the portico of no , 262 . she was followed by another similar woman , and watched by a butler and a footman at the summit of the steps and by a footman on the pavement and by the coachman on the box of the carriage . she carried a thick and lovely white shawl . and in this shawl was lord [male] and all his many and heavy responsibilities .
what we could see inland was peaceable enough , but only moonlit glimpses . by daylight we lay very close , as person said . we did not wish to kill the old ladies -- even if we could . and short of that they were perfectly competent to pick [location] up bodily and carry [location] back , if discovered . there was nothing for it but to lie low , and sneak out unseen if we could do it .
he is worth dollar 50,000 , because he has documentary evidence to show that a man who made that amount out of deceased hogs . had the misfortune to be his father and then die , it was a great triumph to be born under such circumstances . and yet the young man lacks the mental stamina necessary to know how to successfully eat common mush and milk in such a low key that will not alarm the police . i use this incident more as an illustration than anything else . it illustrates how anything may be successfully introduced into an article of this kind without having any bearing whatever upon it .
he walked to the other side of the ring and repeated the remark . a raucous welcome was accorded to the new member , loud applause . mr. [male] was one of the famous , a fighter with a reputation from [location] to [location] . he was generally considered the most likely man to give the hitherto invincible [male] a hard battle for the light weight championship . `` oh , you al. , '' roared the crowd , there was noticeably less applause for the kid .
any man can be praised -- and rightly praised , if he only stands on two legs he does something a cow can not do . if a rich man can manage to stand on two legs for a reasonable time . it is called self control , if he has only one leg . it is called self sacrifice , i could say something nice about every man i have ever met . therefore , i do not doubt i could find something nice about lyons or selfridge if i searched for it .
[male] , whose wits were sharpened by his passion . instantly saw how he might avail himself of that circumstance . [male] [organization] , he said . i will give you a prayer in writing . which you have only to recite once or twice , and it will take away your pain forthwith .
i hope he did not hurt you much . you are the third person he 's bitten today . she kissed the animal in a loving and congratulatory way on the tip of his black nose . not counting waiters at the hotel , of course , ', she added . and then she was swept from him in the crowd .
my wife too , was apparently so penitent , and i was so much infatuated with her . that i forgave her , and even consented to continue to live with her . but i removed to greenville , [location] , [female] , where i went into the black smithing business . and was very successful , we lived here long enough to add two children to our little family . but as time went on , the woman became bad again , and displayed the worst depravity .
who this mrs waters was , the reader pretty well knows . what she was , he must be perfectly satisfied , he will therefore be pleased to remember that this lady departed from [location] in the same coach with mr fitzpatrick and the other irish gentleman . and in their company travelled to bath , now there was a certain office in the gift of mr fitzpatrick at that time vacant . namely that of a wife : for the lady who had lately filled that office had resigned . or at least deserted her duty , mr fitzpatrick therefore .
if you do not like it you can prevent it , ', said [male] . `` you can prevent it by keeping him from speaking to me ! '' and with this she walked away , very conscious of what she had done ; measuring it and finding a certain joy and a quickened sense of freedom in it . once [female] had begun to come and see her by himself and for himself . he came very often , he hardly knew why he should come .
evidently i was mistaken about goff , cycling 's the thing in scotland . consummation of human delight this , to lie prone on your face amid the wet heather . with the rain pattering down incessantly , or the snow pitilessly falling , covering you up flake by flake as if it were a robin and you a babe in the wood . must not stir ; must not speak ; if you can conveniently dispense with the operation . better not breathe , sometimes , after morning and greater part of afternoon thus cheerfully spent .
you can never rouse [female] , there is no poetry about harris—no wild yearning for the unattainable . [male] never `` weeps , he knows not why. '' if [male] 's eyes fill with tears . you can bet it is because [male] has been eating raw onions . or has put too much worcester over his chop , in the present instance .
nervousness at cricket is a curious thing . as the author of willow the king , himself a county cricketer . has said , it is not the fear of getting out that causes funk . it is a sort of intangible je ne sais quoi . i trust i make myself clear .
[male] , the bulwark of the side . the man who had been brought up on wrykyn bowling . and from whom , whatever might happen to the others , at least a fifty was expected . [male] , going in first with [male] and taking first over , had played inside one from bruce . the wrykyn slow bowler , and had been caught at short slip off his second ball .
other rioters joined in from the right , the noise spread through the gallery as a fire spreads through gorse . soon three hundred pairs of well shod feet were rising and falling , somebody began to whistle , everybody whistled . mr [male] was on his feet , gesticulating wildly . his words were lost in the uproar , for five minutes the din prevailed . then , with a final crash , fenn finished , he got up from the music stool .
if meant to be immediately mixed with the others , and buried from sight , she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across . for it was not mixed ; and harriet , eager after every fresh word . and finding out none , directly took it up , and fell to work , she was sitting by mr. [male] . and turned to him for help , the word was blunder . and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it , there was a blush on [male] 's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible .
two pleasant people sat in the room , one -- a boy of nineteen . was studying a small manual of anatomy , and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano . from time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned . for the day was hot and the print small , and the human frame fearfully made . and his mother , who was writing a letter , did continually read out to him what she had written .
the men went back through the rear doors , the late caller would here have left . being fed up with this sort of stuff , but at that moment he descried the montague girl back behind a light standard . she had not noted him , but was in close talk with a man he recognized as [male] . arch perpetrator of the infamous buckeye comedies . they came toward him , still talking , as he looked .
after he went to sandhurst i lost sight of him . and only a few months since the news of his death in the soudan . where he fell gallantly , made me sorrowfully aware that we should never meet again . i had a lingering fancy that marjory might appear to me once more . but i have long since given up all hope of that in this life .
`` go to hell , '' he shouted , he strode to the door and shot into the street . a seething volcano , yes , sir , he said , very good , sir , ', and withdrew . [male] , having reached the top of the stairs . had to check the wild rush he was making for the bathroom in order not to collide with steve . whom he found waiting for him with outstretched hand and sympathetic excitement writ large upon his face .
there are two letters in the `` clarion '' this week which in various ways interest me very much . one is concerned to defend [male] against the scientific revolt against him that was led by [male] . and among other things it calls [male] a back number . well , most certainly `` the origin of species '' is a back number . in so far as any honest and interesting book ever can be ; but in pure philosophy nothing can be out of date .
a hog on a pleasure excursion in [location] . think of it , it is striking and unusual . a body might write a poem about it . he could not retreat , if he had been disposed to do it . it would have been foolish to stand upon our dignity in a place where there was hardly room to stand upon our feet .
it was the level voice of j . person , the steward , the stewards of the white star line . besides being the civillest and most obliging body of men in the world . all have soft and pleasant voices , a white star steward . waking you up at six thirty , to tell you that your bath is ready .
`` of course you will come again , '' she said . `` what is it ails you ? you are unhappy because she is here with my cousin [male] ? '' it was intolerable to him that any one should suspect him of jealousy . [male] has a way of getting intimate with people . but it means nothing , it was dreadful to him that an allusion should be made to the possibility of anybody meaning anything
[male] did not dare to tell him that she would have preferred to have been left in arundel street . but that , at the moment , was her feeling , if , when all this was over . she would still have to earn her bread , it would have been much better for her not to have come among her rich relations . what good would it then do her to have lived two or three months in cavendish square ? `` i wish it were all settled , [female] , '' she said .
so and so , in such and such avenue ; a servant appears ; the lady of the house is asked for and is declared to be out . at which astounding information , the visitor expresses the most poignant regret . his business is of importance and concerns the lady herself . in fact , he had the good fortune to find her diamond ring . but perhaps it would be as well that he should call again , `` by no means ! ''
another hall mark by which we can tell whether a man has arrived or not is provided by the interview . if a lepidopterist is just beginning his career , nobody bothers about his opinions on anything . if he is moderately well-known in his profession , the papers will seek his help whenever his own particular subject comes up in the day 's news . there is a suggestion , perhaps , in parliament that butterflies should be muzzled . and `` our representative '' promptly calls upon `` the well-known lepidopterist '' to ask what he thinks about it .
in merry old england it once was the rule . the king had his poet and also his fool . but now we are so frugal , i would have you to know it . that cibber can serve both for fool and for poet . [male] , the elder , being asked what he was going to do with his son ( the young man 's profession was to be that of an architect ) .
here he could be truly himself , a man 's man . loving the simple things of life , here , in his library . surrounded by his books , or in the music room playing over some little chopin prelude . or on the lawn romping with the giant police dog . he could forget the public that would not let him rest .
for it did seem to me the most beautiful room i ever beheld . it was more than a hundred feet long , and about half that in width . and the crystal glitter overhead reflected in the shinin floor below wuz ahead of anything i had ever seen . as brilliant as a hull forest of ice sickles mingled in with statutes and columns and angels and everything else beautiful .
the fact is , however , the argument wo not be sincere , when their nations grow so over populous and their families so large it means misery . that will not be a sign of their having felt ready for discipline , it will be a sign of their not having practised it in their sexual lives . the simians are always being stirred by desire and passion . it constantly excites them , constantly runs through their minds . wild or tame , primitive or cultured , this is a brand of the breed .
things were at this point when [female] . whom [male] recognised at a considerable distance by his horse . was perceived approaching , he also recognised [male] and [male] . but not the duke , and did not know what he was to do , or whether he ought to rejoin his friend or not . he therefore inquired of the duke 's servants who the gentleman was .
freddie glanced at her anxiously , he was not at all sure now that he liked the way she was looking or the tone in which she spoke . he was not a keenly observant young man , but there did begin at this point to seep through to his brain centres a suspicion that all was not well . `` let me pull myself together , '' said [organization] warily to his immortal soul . `` i believe i am getting the raspberry , '' and there was silence for a space . the complexity of life began to weigh upon [organization] .
we go inside , while i finger the dollar in my pocket and do some fast mental arithmetic . lasagna is a dollar , so that 's out , but i see spaghetti and meat balls is seventy five cents . so that will still leave me bus fare home . a waiter rushes up , wearing a white napkin over his arm like a banner . and takes our order , he returns in a moment with a shiny clean white linen tablecloth and a basket of fresh italian bread and rolls .
`` oh , all right , '' and [male] retired with his book . then he wrote two notes , one -- to the bishop . he placed on top of the cash box . the other he placed with four sovereigns on the table in monk 's study . finally he left the room , shut the door carefully behind him .
in these reflections i passed the night , the day dawned and found [location] both in the court . she lying still insensible , and i on my haunches beside her . attentively watching her hideous countenance , the people of the hospital came out . and seeing this spectacle , some of them exclaimed , the pious cañizares is dead ! see how emaciated she is with fasting and penance , others felt her pulse .
she quoted interminable passages from certain essays on government . written by herself ; used the major 's pocket handkerchief as if the snuffle were a temporary malady . of which she was determined to rid herself by some means or other . and , in short , was such a remarkable companion , that martin quite settled it between himself and his conscience . that in any new settlement it would be absolutely necessary to have such a person knocked on the head for the general peace of society .
this plateau must be crossed with great caution , as the crevasses are often hidden by the snow . besides , it is often swept by avalanches . on the 13th of october , 1866 , an english traveller and three of his guides were buried under a mass of ice that fell from [male] after a perilous search . the bodies of the three guides were found , they were expecting every moment to find that of the englishman . when a fresh avalanche fell upon the first , and forced the searchers to abandon their task .
emma allowed her father to talk -- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style . and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy . the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions . miss [organization] was so great a personage in highbury . that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure .
he said there must be witchcraft at the bottom of it . and told the villagers to resume relations with marget and ursula in a private and unostentatious way . and keep both eyes open , they were told to keep their own counsel . and not rouse the suspicions of the household , the villagers were at first a bit reluctant to enter such a dreadful place . but the priest said they would be under his protection while there , and no harm could come to them .
he addressed his ball , and drove a beauty over the trees . it flashed out of sight in the direction of the seventeenth tee . [male] and i made our way down the hill to play our second . it is a curious trait of the human mind that . however little personal interest one may have in the result , it is impossible to prevent oneself taking sides in any event of a competitive nature .
one of the most sacred rights that a man , an [location] citizen . enjoys is the right to cast a ballot for the man or men he would have legislate for him . and for no trivial reason can that right , when once granted to the [location] citizen . be taken away from him , go to the state of [location] . and trace the history of citizen suffrage , and you find it commenced in this way .
[male] said it was a beautiful profession that had for its object the alleviation of human pain . [female] tried to get in a good word for boxers . but nobody would listen to her except me , it was all [female] . [female] , [male] , and the triumphs of modern medicine . altogether he sailed through that whole day with flying colors .
the simple result will be that , in the scientific utopia of the `` clarion , '' men like mann or syme or larkin will not be put in prison because of what they have done . they will be kept in prison because of what they might do . indeed , the builders of the new tyranny have already come very near to avowing this scientific and futurist method . when the lawyers tried to stop the `` suffragette '' from appearing at all , they practically said .
but bill did not pass a good night , he lay awake long . thinking over his plans for the morrow , lady wetherby was feeling battered . she had not realized how seriously roscoe sherriff took the art of publicity . nor what would be the result of the half hour he had spent at the telephone on the night of the departure of eustace . roscoe sherriff 's eloquence had fired the imagination of editors .
we had a refreshing rest . there in [location] , in a great old mansion which possessed historical interest . it was built by a rich englishman who had become orientalized -- so much so that he had a zenana . but he was a broadminded man , and remained so , to please his harem he built a mosque . to please himself he built an english church .
how good that celery should be there at one 's elbow , yes , i can face the winter with calm . i suppose i had forgotten what it was really like . i had been thinking of the winter as a horrid wet . dreary time fit only for professional football . now i can see other things -- crisp and sparkling days .
its attractions included a lovers leap , a grotto . golf links -- a five hole course where the enthusiast found unusual hazards in the shape of a number of goats tethered at intervals between the holes . and a silvery lake , only portions of which were used as a dumping ground for tin cans and wooden boxes . it was all new and strange to [male] and caused him an odd exhilaration . something of gaiety and reckless abandon began to creep into his veins .
( being , in point of fact , only a matter of five hundred years old . it would have the same effect today on the average [location] playgoer if it was produced in a west end theatre . ) the plot was simple , it is set forth in person return of the native ', . but , as the people who read my books have no energy left over to cope with other authors . i must supply an outline of it myself .
how often he had seen those two little skips and the jump . it was like being in the paddock again , with marjory and the dogs waiting by the railings to fetch the ball if he made a drive . now , saunders was a conscientious man , and , doubtless , bowled the very best ball that he possibly could . on the other hand , it was [male] 's first appearance for the school . and saunders , besides being conscientious , was undoubtedly kind hearted , it is useless to speculate as to whether he was trying to bowl his best that ball .
how could he have been expected to notice a very trifling incongruous detail as he passed the log cabin ? indeed many a keener eyed and entirely valorous night watchman might have neglected to observe that the leathern latch string of the cabin 's closed door was no longer hanging outside . dawn brought the wide stretches of the holden lot into gray relief . it lightened the big yellow stages and crept down the narrow street of the western town where only the ghosts of dead plays stalked . it burnished the rich fronts of the fifth avenue mansions and in the next block illumined the rough sides of a miner 's cabin .
and there is the buffoon , he is distinct from the butt . because a butt is usually a butt malgre lui . owing to some peculiarity of appearance or temperament . whereas the buffoon is one of those people who yearn for notice at any price . and will sell their souls `` to make fellows laugh , '' you may behold him .
still , that 's what you call love , and if you have got it . and are well shaved , and your boots well blacked , you can do things that seem almost impossible . yes , you can do anything , even if you do trip over the dog in getting off the piazza . do not suppose for a moment that judge pepperleigh was an unapproachable or a harsh man always and to everybody . even mr. [male] had to admit that that could not be so , to know that .
`` i do not think it at all right that [female] should be left with the dean , '' said the old lady to her second daughter , but the old lady was specially prejudiced against the dean as being her eldest son 's great enemy . before the day was over lord [male] wrote a long letter to his wife . full of affection indeed , but still more full of covert reproaches , he did not absolutely scold her . but he told her that there could be no happiness between a wife and a husband unless the wife would obey .
he is a loafer , a hard drinker . and a sponge , he tramps across the country in the sheep shearing season . pretending to look for work ; but he always times himself to arrive at a sheep run just at sundown . when the day 's labor ends . all he wants is whisky and supper and bed and breakfast .
- the young fellow , said the landlord , is beloved by all the town . and there is scarce a corner in [location] where the want of him will not be felt . he has but one misfortune in the world . continued he , `` he is always in love . '' i am heartily glad of it , said i .
this conviction perhaps gave birth to many stories of the antient heathen deities ( for most of them are of poetical original ) . the poet , being desirous to indulge a wanton and extravagant imagination . took refuge in that power , of the extent of which his readers were no judges . or rather which they imagined to be infinite , and consequently they could not be shocked at any prodigies related of it . this hath been strongly urged in defence of homer 's miracles .
on the whole , [location] did not impress me as it has impressed certain other travelers . you see , i was born and raised in one of those [location] towns where the river gets emotional and temperamental every year or two . in my youth i had passed through several of these visitations . when the family would take the family plate and the family cow . and other treasures , and retire to the attic floor to wait for the spring rise to abate .
an ounce of invention is worth a pound of style . a good name is rather to be chosen than great characters , where there 's so much puff . there must be some buyer , in days of old , so i have been told . the monkeys gave a feast , they sent out cards . with kind regards , to every bird and beast .
[female] , at the other end , resumed his brilliant career . his century and [male] 's fifty arrived in the same over . the bowling began to grow loose , [male] , having reached his century . slowed down somewhat , and [male] took up the running , the score rose rapidly . a leg theory bowler kept down the pace of the run getting for a time .
she had been surgically remodeled so many times that she dated everything from her last operation . at least six times in her life she had been down with something that was absolutely incurable . and she was now going to homburg to have one of the newest and most fatal german diseases in its native haunts . where it would be at its best , she herself said that she was but a mere shell . and for the first few meals she ate like one -- like a large , empty shell with plenty of curves inside it .
i left him talking volubly to the committee . he was not a nice man at all , after that i did not care to win . and that of course was fatal , the less i tried , the more impossible it seemed for me to do wrong . i was left in at the last with a man from another hotel . but for that i am convinced i should have carried off the handicap .
jellicoe was profuse in his thanks . and disappeared in a cloud of gratitude , [male] felt that fate was treating him badly . being kept in on saturday meant that he would be unable to turn out for little borlock against claythorpe . the return match , in the previous game he had scored ninety eight . and there was a lob bowler in the claythorpe ranks whom he was particularly anxious to meet again .
is well preserved , one peculiar feature of the book is that , even now . for some places , it would be a useful guide . many of the habits and customs of [location] three hundred years ago being still the same . what a volume of wit and wisdom is contained in the proverbs and aphorisms . one might quote from it indefinitely had he not told [location] that `` without discretion there is no wit . ''
[male] gill was entranced by this exposition of the quieter side of his idol 's life . of course he had known she could not always be making narrow escapes . and it seemed that she was almost more delightful in this staid domestic life . here , away from her professional perils , she was , it seemed . `` a slim little girl with sad eyes and a wistful mouth . ''
sentiment succeeded whimsicality , his old friends of the office . those were the men to benefit , what good fellows they had been ! some were dead , but he still kept intermittently in touch with half a dozen of them . and -- an important point -- he knew their present addresses . this point was important , because mr meggs had decided not to leave a will .
that was all , a crowd rose out of the dusk , it hid this extraordinary man from her . and bore him away to the fountain , mr. [male] happened to be a few paces away . looking at her across the spot where the man had been . how very odd , across something , even as she caught sight of him he grew dim . the palace itself grew dim , swayed above her .
the flexile waist gently tapering little farther than the middle of the trunk . the lower portion of it beginning gradually to swell out higher even than the umbilicus . the gradual expansion of the haunches , those expressive characteristics of the female . indicating at once her fitness for the office of generation and that of parturition . expansions which increase till they reach their greatest extent at the superior part of the thighs .
it was a little after one when he found himself at the cathedral door . and thinking that the dean and his daughter might be at lunch . he went into the building , so that he might get rid of half an hour . he had not often been in cathedrals of late years . and now looked about him with something of awe .
he had the best chance of all , wiser even than the lion . or the wisest of apes , his wisdom furthermore was benign where theirs was sinister . consider his dignity , his poise and skill . he was plastic , too , he had learned to eat many foods and endure many climates . once , some say , this race explored the globe , their bones are found everywhere .
this therefore would seem an exception to the above rule . if indeed it was a rule ; but as we have in our voyage through life seen so many other exceptions to it . we chuse to dispute the doctrine on which it is founded . which we do not apprehend to be christian , which we are convinced is not true . and which is indeed destructive of one of the noblest arguments that reason alone can furnish for the belief of immortality .
`` i say , '' he remarks , `` why not get up some theatricals ? '' eve , in the person of some young lady who would be a drawing room reciter if drawing room reciters were allowed nowadays . snatches at the apple , `` oh , yes , '' she says . `` it ought to be for a charity , '' suggests somebody else . `` of course for a charity , '' says the serpent .
the king was not interested , and wanted to move along , but i was absorbed . and full of pity , i could not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity . there they sat , grounded upon the ground , silent , uncomplaining . with bowed heads , a pathetic sight , and by hideous contrast . a redundant orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty steps away .
or broil him on a gridiron and serve him up on toast to madame prewster . like a huge woodcock , in one gastronomic nightmare of a dream he even fancied that the triumphant maiden had tied him . hand and foot , with links of sausages . then tapped his head with an auger , screwed a brass faucet into his helpless skull . and was preparing to draw off his brains in small quantities to suit cannibalic retail customers .
sez i , when your illustrious father come up face to face with a foe no other general could manage . did he flinch and draw back because it had been called onmanageable by everybody else ? no , he drawed a line between good and evil , black and white , and says . `` i will fight it right out on this line . '' and he did , and before his courage and bravery and persistence the foe fell .
the news was conveyed to [organization] rooke by [female] . [male] , with something of the emotions of a condemned man on the scaffold waiting for a reprieve . had watched jill and mr pilkington go off together into the dim solitude at the back of the orchestra chairs . and , after an all too brief interval , had observed the latter whizzing back . his every little movement having a meaning of its own—and that meaning one which convinced [male] that [organization] .
he made it plainer than ever that he was a model young man and a pattern . mrs. [male] compared him to her departed husband . and talked about old-fashioned courtesy and the splendid men of her youth . everybody fell over everybody else to praise him . it was a regular [male] boom .
but the newcomer applied himself , rather , to phenomena of the internal world , saying that his life might be likened to a barque tossed on the crests of perfidious billows . that in his time he had been fated to play many parts . and that on more than one occasion his life had stood in danger at the hands of foes . at the same time , these tidings were communicated in a manner calculated to show that the speaker was also a man of practical capabilities . in conclusion , the visitor took out a cambric pocket handkerchief .
he went to highbury the next morning , and satisfied himself on that point . he told her the news . was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter ? he must tell her ; and miss bates being present , it passed . of course , to mrs. [female] , mrs. [female] .
the members of the club expressed themselves eminently satisfied with mr. [male] 's statement of his experience . and the higholdboy requested that mr. [male] should inscribe in the records the said experience . in order that it might not be lost to future generations . mr. [male] promised to do so , mr. [male] . being seized with a fit of liberality , ordered punches for the company .
3 , the automaton does not invariably win the game , were the machine a pure machine this would not be the case . it would always win , the principle being discovered by which a machine can be made to play a game of chess . an extension of the same principle would enable it to win a game . a farther extension would enable it to win all games . that is , to beat any possible game of an antagonist , a little consideration will convince any one that the difficulty of making a machine beat all games .
it appeared , however , that maraquita did not want to avoid bloodshed , that she rather liked bloodshed . that the leaders of the revolution would be disappointed if there were no bloodshed , especially bombito . unless , she pointed out , there was a certain amount of carnage . looting , and so on , the revolution would not achieve a popular success . true , the beloved alejandro might be restored ; but he would sit upon a throne that was insecure .
o new father , what a pleasure must all these things be for you . and especially , because now you begin at the bed side to eat and drink again with your child bed wife . and you begin also to perceive that if all things advance as they hitherto have done . you may then again in few daies make fresh assaults of hugging and embracing her . this is that jolly month or six weeks that all women talk so pleasantly of .
if , on the contrary , the woman meeting her be ugly , and the lady observed be beautiful . then the former will examine the latter with the severest scrutiny . and if she sees features and shape without defect . she will instantly fix her eyes on the head dress or gown . in order to find some object for censure of the beautiful woman .
we boys who could not walk across the floor without feeling that our pants had hiked up till they showed our feet to the knees . and that we were carrying a couple of canvased hams where our hands ought to be . did not like him ; but the girls did , you can trust a woman 's taste on everything except men . and it 's mighty lucky that she slips up there or we would pretty nigh all be bachelors . i might add that you can not trust a man 's taste on women .
i get no chance to name anything myself . the new creature names everything that comes along . before i can get in a protest , and always that same pretext is offered . it looks like the thing , there is the dodo , for instance . says the moment one looks at it one sees at a glance that it `` looks like a dodo . ''
patty 's class room methods were the result of a wide experience in the professorial type of mind . by her senior year she had reduced the matter of recitation to a system . and could foretell with unvarying precision the day she would be called on and the question she would be asked . her tactics varied with the subject and the instructor . and were the result of a penetration and knowledge of human nature that might have accomplished something in a worthier cause .
other features grow abnormal , or shrink up from the lack of use . as a result of our customs , for instance . the man whose business it is to get along a crowded street with the utmost speed will have . finally , a hard , sharp horn growing on each elbow , and a pair of spurs growing out of each ankle . these will enable him to climb over a crowd and get there early , constant exposure to these weapons on the part of the pedestrian will harden the walls of the thorax and abdomen until the coming man will be an impervious man .
and ever so many times they talked so intimately that [female] came mighty near telling her about his home in the maritime provinces and about his father and mother . and then kicked himself that he had not the manliness to speak straight out about it and take the consequences . please do not imagine from any of this that the course of mr. [male] 's love ran smooth . on the contrary , [male] himself felt that it was absolutely hopeless from the start . there were , it might be admitted , certain things that seemed to indicate progress .
but when i finally ceased from taking definite pledges , and merely resolved that i would kill an injurious desire . but leave myself free to resume the desire and the habit whenever i should choose to do so . i had no more trouble , in five days i drove out the desire to smoke and was not obliged to keep watch after that . and i never experienced any strong desire to smoke again , at the end of a year and a quarter of idleness i began to write a book . and presently found that the pen was strangely reluctant to go , i tried a smoke to see if that would help me out of the difficulty , it did .
chapter vi -- containing a scene which we doubt not will affect all our readers . chapter viii -- what passed between [male] and old mr nightingale . with the arrival of a person not yet mentioned in this history . chapter x -- a short chapter . which concludes the book , chapter ii .
[male] and eliza gurnsey were still carrying on the millinery business in rutland . and in montpelier , and were no doubt weaving other and new webs in hopes of catching fresh flies . [female] , as i learned soon afterwards . was married almost before i had fairly escaped from new hampshire in my flight to [location] . and she had gone to [location] with her new husband .
the next afternoon he met the enemy at resaca [male] la palma . and whipped him in the time usually required to ejaculate the word `` scat ! '' general [male] was sent to take [location] and [location] . his work consisted mainly in marching for general [male] , who had been surveying a new route to [location] . and had with sixty men been so successful that on the arrival of [male] .
[female] came out the next morning into the little garden to a fresh silver day . his long face looking more austere than ever in that cold light , his eyelids a little heavy . he carried one of the swords , [male] was in the little house behind him . demolishing the end of an early breakfast and humming a tune to himself . which could be heard through the open window , a moment or two later he leapt to his feet and came out into the sunlight .
) he quickly introduced me to the audience . ladies and gentlemen , -- this evening i have the honour of introducing to you a gentleman whom we have all heard about . but few of us , if any , have seen before , we all know his work in parliament in the pages of punch for some years past . we all have enjoyed the writings of `` toby , m.p . '' this is mr. [male] , of punch , our old friend `` toby , m.p , ''
having arrived at olympia , we perambulated the bazaar prior to the commencement of the shows . and here ( after parting with rs , eight for three seats on the balcony ) . i did bleed more freely still , for miss [female] expressed a passionate longing to possess my profile . snipped out of paper by the scissors of a silhouette . for which i mulcted one shilling sterling , and , after all , although it proved the alter ego and speaking likeness of my embossed bombay cap and golden spectacles .
[female] was dressed by the time matthew had the fire on and had the breakfast ready when marilla came down . but for her own part was much too excited to eat , after breakfast the jaunty new cap and jacket were donned . and [male] hastened over the brook and up through the firs to orchard slope . mr. [male] and diana were waiting for her . and they were soon on the road , it was a long drive .
whilst chichikov was gazing at this extraordinary mess . a side door opened and there entered the housekeeper who had met him near the outbuildings . but now chichikov perceived this person to be a man rather than a woman . since a female housekeeper would have had no beard to shave , whereas the chin of the newcomer . with the lower portion of his cheeks , strongly resembled the curry comb which is used for grooming horses .
after the deluge there is a chasm in the history of women . until the time of the patriarch [male] . they then begin to be introduced into the sacred story , several of their actions are recorded . the laws , customs , and usages . by which they were governed , are frequently exhibited , the condition of women among the ancient patriarchs .
the fourth hole follows the curve of the road . on the other side of which are picturesque woods , it presents no difficulties to the expert . but it has pitfalls for the novice . the dashing player stands for a slice . while the more cautious are satisfied if they can clear the [female] that spans the fairway and lay their ball well out to the left .
no doubt many of the clergy of the diocese had suffered more or less just as the dean had from lack of mathematical training . but the dean always felt that his own case was especially to be lamented , for you see . if a man is trying to make a model aeroplane . for a poor family in the lower part of the town . and he is brought to a stop by the need of reckoning the coefficient of torsion of cast-iron rods .
just as we had begun to despair , however , here he comes . quietly and unostentatiously , modestly and ungrammatically , unheralded and silently , like [male] s. or any other eminent man . he slowly rises above the [location] horizon . and tells [location] that it will be impossible to conceal his identity any longer . he is the approaching humorist of the nineteenth century .
all this , so far , was quite in the manner of domestics who , in ghost stories . give warning to the occupants of haunted houses . and [female] 's mistress listened in suspense for the motive of her desertion . expecting to hear no less than that it was something which walked up and down the stairs and dragged iron links after it . or something that came and groaned at the front door , like populace dissatisfied with a political candidate .
mr , [male] was as firmly convinced at that moment that [male] 's had been the hand to wield the paint brush as he had ever been of anything in his life . there are moments when the giddy excitement of being right on the trail causes the amateur detective to be incautious . such a moment came to mr , [male] then , if he had been wise . he would have achieved his object , the getting a glimpse of [male] 's boots . by a devious and snaky route , as it was , he rushed straight on .
and now this wholly unforeseen severing of diplomatic relations had popped up through a trap . i gave the thing the cream of the wooster brain all the way down . but it continued to beat me what could have caused the outbreak of hostilities . and i bunged my foot sedulously on the accelerator in order to get to aunt dahlia with the greatest possible speed and learn the inside history straight from the horse 's mouth . and what with all six cylinders hitting nicely , i made good time and found myself closeted with the relative shortly before the hour of the evening cocktail .
i wait , the duel continues , what grim determination . what perseverance can these bohemians put into a mad jest ! i find myself thinking how much better it would be were they to apply to their art the same earnestness and fixity of purpose which they squander on a practical joke , evening fell . blinds began to be drawn down , lamps were lit behind them . one by one , despair was gnawing at my heart , but still i waited .
it 's odd how one thing leads to another , by the time the chancery barrister has got his quotation right . the patriarch is half a mile ahead in the wrong direction , and we all have to go and look for him . the col [male] jaman is the salvation of many tourists . not being regular alpine climbers , they start over the dent and get as far as the col . rest awhile just under the great mountain molar .
for , with regard to her lawful companion , confidence is changed to timidity . love to hypocrisy , and a continual fear torments her . lest accident or malice should discover her imprudence . how dearly is the pleasure of a moment procured when it is purchased by years of unhappiness ! on the other hand , it is extremely unreasonable for some persons to indulge as they do .
he was too late , it fell to the ground and bounded away . with its proprietor in passionate chase , [male] snorted and gently chafed his knuckles . there was a calm about mr shute 's demeanour as . having given his treasure a final polish and laid it carefully down . he began to advance on his adversary , which was more than ominous , his lips were a thin line of steel .
but his daughters , less tranquil minded , burst into a torrent of indignation . this came , they said , of cherishing such creatures as the pinches . this came of lowering themselves to their level , this came of putting themselves in the humiliating position of seeming to know such bold . audacious , cunning , dreadful girls as that , they had expected this , they had predicted it to mrs todgers . as she could depone , that very morning , to this , they added .
in a country where every man in whatever station of life is a keen politician . this is a great thing to say for one in the position of the prince of wales . this absolute impartiality of attitude does not arise from indifference to politics or to the current of political warfare . the prince is a peer of parliament . sits as duke of cornwall , and under that name figures in the division lists on the rare occasions when he votes .
well , he really did not seem to be any particular restraint upon them . judging from what ensued , was it folly in [male] to be so pleased by their remembrance of him at such a time ? was their graceful love a folly , were their dear caresses follies , was their lengthened parting folly ? was it folly in him to watch her window from the street . and rate its scantiest gleam of light above all diamonds .
adam was the first man to `` misunderstand '' a woman . a man is like a park squirrel . if you fling your favors or your charms at his head he will never come up and eat out of your hand . what a man calls his `` conscience '' is merely the mental action that follows a sentimental reaction after too much wine or love . in the school of love , a man is forever just taking up a brand new `` study '' and discovering that all the old loves were nothing but `` preparatory practice . ''
these three had the house to themselves , and peppered the government benches with question after question . speech after speech , sir [male] alluded to themselves as `` a band of devoted guerillas . '' the weary house , not paying particular attention to every accent . failed to catch most of what sir [male] said , as his rasping scotch accent left them no escape . but the last word was misunderstood , and an outburst of laughter .
[female] moved uncomfortably in her chair , her quick temper resented his tone . there was a hostility , a hardly veiled contempt in his voice which stung her . derek was sacred , whoever criticized him , presumed , wally , a few minutes before a friend and an agreeable companion . seemed to her to have changed , he was once more the boy whom she had disliked in the old days . there was a gleam in her eyes which should have warned him .
great horned cattle stood knee deep in this grass , and at the villages and way stations were people wearing sheepskin jackets and waistcoats covered with silver buttons . in one place there was a wedding procession waiting for the train to pass . with the friends of the bride and groom in their best clothes . the women with silver breastplates . and boots to their knees , it seemed hardly possible that only two days before they had seen another wedding party in the champs elysees .
but i wuz glad to see that other folks realized the importance of the subject . for they have given as much space to air navigation as for all the other modes of transportation put together , the buildin covers about fourteen acres -- i wonder what sister bobbett would say to that . the walls are thirty feet high , the lower twelve feet . air tight , the upper eighteen feet lattice work .
it would seem he had lately invented a hair restorer . which he had persuaded a local chemist to take up and advertise , half his time he had been pointing out to us . not the beauties of prague , but the benefits likely to accrue to the human race from the use of this concoction . and the conventional agreement with which , under the impression he was waxing eloquent concerning views and architecture . we had met his enthusiasm he had attributed to sympathetic interest in this wretched wash of his .
but to return to the duke , he had now been under water for a full minute . swimming down stream ; and he calculated that he had yet another full minute of consciousness . already the whole of his past life had vividly presented itself to him . myriads of tiny incidents , long forgotten , now standing out sharply in their due sequence . he had mastered this conspectus in a flash of time .
and dr. grimstone really did arrive at this point , much to paul 's relief . and looked in to give a grip of the hand and a few words to those of the boys he had not seen . biddlecomb , tipping , and the rest . came in with him , and the schoolroom soon filled with others arriving by later trains . amongst the later comers being the two house masters , mr. [male] and mr. [male] .
the little deception could do no harm , and everything would come out right and pleasant in the end , anyway . by agreement , the conversation in roxy 's presence was all about the man 's `` up country '' farm . and how pleasant a place it was , and how happy the slaves were there . so poor roxy was entirely deceived ; and easily , for she was not dreaming that her own son could be guilty of treason to a mother who . in voluntarily going into slavery -- slavery of any kind .
then the duke he lets the curtain down . and bows to the people , and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more . on accounts of pressing [location] engagements . where the seats is all sold already for it in drury lane . and then he makes them another bow .
you are indeed a heartless , soulless corporation . and yet you are very essential in our business , dear [male] . your letter stating that you had just succeeded in running your face for a new curriculum is at hand and contents noted . as the feller said when i wrote to him two years ago and told him that his cussed railroad had mashed old brin . you remember that just as you entered on what you called your junior year .
the little boy made no further attempt to justify his conduct . he was a very wise little boy , and he knew that . in uncle remus 's eyes , he had been guilty of a flagrant violation of the family code . therefore , instead of attempting to justify himself , he pleaded guilty , and promised that he would never do so any more . after this there was a long period of silence , broken only by the vigorous style in which uncle remus puffed away at his pipe .
`` then do not disappoint matthew , '' said the pink lady , laughing . smiling , blushing , limpid eyed , [female] tripped back and gave a [female] . funny little selection that captivated her audience still further . the rest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her . when the concert was over , the stout , pink lady .
but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency . there was a languor , a want of spirits . a want of union , which could not be got over , they separated too much into parties . the eltons walked together ; mr. [female] took charge of miss bates and [male] . and emma and harriet belonged to [male] churchill , and mr. [male] tried .
the mouth is rendered sweet and delicate by the lips being undeveloped at their angles . and by the upper lip continuing so , for a considerable portion of its length . it expresses love of pleasure by the central development of both lips . and active love by the especial development of the lower lip . by the slight opening of the lips , it expresses desire .
takes a cursory glance at the scenery and either climbs down again or tumbles down . and starts off once more -- as usual , in a new direction , at the end of half an hour . he fetches up within six inches of the place he started from and lays his burden down . meantime he has been over all the ground for two yards around . and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across .
there was an invitation from the butterfly club asking her to be the guest of honour at their weekly dinner . there was a letter from her brother mallaby . sir [male] , the eminent [location] lawyer . saying that his son [male] , of whom she had never approved . would be in [location] shortly , passing through on his way back to england , and hoping that she would see something of him .
these men drilled a long time on what they called a heifer dance . a beautiful spectacular , and highly moral and instructive quadruped clog . sirloin shuffle , and [female] . to the music of a piano forte , the rehearsals had been crowned with success . and when the cow came on the stage she got a bouquet .
i have called them exemplary , because if you rightly consider them . there is not one of them from which you may not draw some useful example . and were i not afraid of being too prolix , i might show you what savoury and wholesome fruit might be extracted from them . collectively and severally , i have no more to say , so pray god to keep you . and give me patience to bear all the ill that will be spoken of me by more than one subtle and starched critic , person .
well , even if the prices was awful high , they did not have nothin on our seats , if i was in [location] to be a steeple [male] i would go to grand op'ra every night and leave hatch buy my ticket . and where he took [location] i would of been more at home in overalls and a sport shirt . `` how do you like denver ? '' says i to the missus .
the citizen has only to turn the crank of the little iron marten house till the gong ceases to ring . then push on the citizens button , and he can have fun with most any emergency he likes . should he decide , however , to shrink from the emergency before it arrives . he can go away from there , or secrete himself and watch the surprise of the ambulance driver or the fire department when no mangled remains or forked fire fiend is found in that region .
i have before suggested , in as plain terms as the peculiar nature of the subject will allow . that these fortune telling women , having most of them been prostitutes in their younger days . in their withered age become professional procuresses , and make a trade of the betrayal of innocence into the power of lust and lechery . this assertion is so eminently probable that few will be inclined to dispute it , but i wish to be understood that this is no matter of mere surmise with me . it is a proven fact , and the evidences of its truth have been gathered .
with scotch patience and pluck he resolved to live down his reputation and work his way into the legal field yet . poor fellow , he could foresee that it was going to take him such a weary long time to do it . and add the day of the month and the year . then take smith 's left hand on another glass strip . and add name and date and the words `` left hand . ''
if it had been an intentional thing , and based upon a principle . it would not have stopped where it did : we should have applied it further . instead of clothing our admirals and generals , for courts martial and other public functions . in superb dress uniforms blazing with colour and gold . the government would put them in swallow tails and white cravats .
soon after swift 's arrival at [organization] . he gave public notice that he would read prayers every wednesday and friday . on the first of those days after he had summoned his congregation . he ascended the desk , and after sitting some time with no other auditor than his clerk [male] . he rose up and with a composure and gravity that .
ormsby remained for a few minutes leaning against a desk . with his face buried in his arms , and i heard him struggling with his sobs . at last he rose , and left the room without a word . from that night my character seemed to enter upon a new phase . and when i returned to school it was to begin my second term under better auspices .
they moved slowly through the cloisters , neither speaking . and up the stairs that led to the great [female] , each was gratefully conscious of the fact that prayers would be beginning in another minute . putting an end to an uncomfortable situation , the arrival of the headmaster put an end to the conversation . by a quarter to eleven [male] had begun to grow reconciled to his fate . the disappointment was still there , but it was lessened , these things are like kicks on the shin .
love is a pleasing but exciting passion . the eye is delighted by form , manners , and the expression of the features . the ears by musical language , and the imagination paints future joys . all of which contribute to one great principle , that of receiving happiness from those we love . and evincing love for those from whom we derive our happiness .
it is just as well that the gift of second sight is accorded to but few . if fenn could have known at this point that his adventures were only beginning . that what had taken place already was but as the overture to a drama . it is possible that he would have thrown up the sponge for good and all . entered [male] 's by way of the front door .
in what i may say under this head please bear in mind that i do not speak of the cigarette . i am now confining my remarks entirely to the subject of tobacco . the use of the cigarette is , in fact . beneficial in in some ways , and no pest house should try to get along without it . it is said that they are very popular in the orient .
in the early days things went well enough , the natives sold land without clearly understanding the terms of exchange . and the whites bought it without being much disturbed about the native 's confusion of mind . but by and by the maori began to comprehend that he was being wronged ; then there was trouble . for he was not the man to swallow a wrong and go aside and cry about it . he had the tasmanian 's spirit and endurance .
we grieve to state that viscount radnor has sworn that he will never ask for miss plynlimmon 's hand till he has a fortune equal to her own . meantime , we are sorry to say , he proposes to work . you will be very gratified to learn that the fortunes of miss [female] have come to a most pleasing termination . her marriage with the viscount radnor was celebrated very quietly on page 231 . ( we enclose a list of the principal churches in [location] .
i had noticed that he was not wearing his watch . later in the day i had some more conversation with him . he is quite my subordinate at the office . and i really do not know why i should have taken so much notice of him . when i came back that night i was in two minds whether to tell eliza or not .
he said nothing more , he said even this as if he were bound . and in the other 's power , but had a sullen and suppressed devil within him . which he could not quite resist , his very gait , as they walked away together . was like that of a fettered man ; but , striving to work out at his clenched hands . knitted brows , and fast set lips , was the same imprisoned devil still .
[female] wondered if he was to be beaten after all , with difficulty he restrained himself from turning to the man and snarling out . `` go on away , damn you , '' in despair he suspected that perhaps dean had spoken to him . was keeping him along in order to avoid a dispute about the money . they went into the biltmore -- a biltmore alive with girls . mostly from the west and south , the stellar debutantes of many cities gathered for the dance of a famous fraternity of a famous university .
it is , it seems , the fixed belief of my good friend that when he was young he belonged at college to a particularly nefarious crowd or group that exists in his mind under the name of the `` old gang . '' the same association , or corporate body or whatever it should be called . is also designated by mr. [male] , the `` old crowd , '' or more simply and affectionately `` the boys , '' in the recollection of my good friend this `` old gang '' were of a devilishness since lost off the earth , work they would not .
deliberately and in silence [female] walked to the mirror and stood there . gazing at the woman in the glass , there was something dreadful and portentous about the calm and studied deliberation with which she critically viewed that reflection . she lifted her arms slowly and patted into place the locks that had become disarranged . turning her head from side to side to study the effect . then she took from a drawer the bit of chamois skin that i had given her .
